7wqgjn,"31yo, m, suddenly stricken with anxiety and infrequent panic attacks — looking for recommendations",Anxiety,"i’ve carried normal stress like most people these days, but a week or two before christmas 2017, i started having anxiety. at first, i genuinely thought i was having heart/cardiac related issues. i went to see two cardiologists who both said they believed i was healthy (based on ekgs and standard examination). some people kept suggesting it was anxiety but i refused to believe it — this felt like something **physically** wrong with me. i honestly, to this day, can’t tell you what triggered all of this, but since it all started i’ve had at least one instance where i was lying in bed next to my wife and feeling like my world was ending or imploding in on me. there have been moments where, had i really let myself succumb to my emotions, i could have probably been sobbing (with no real explanation or reason for it). i’ve had my blood tested and my free testosterone is only slightly under normal range, so i can’t imagine it would have this large of an impact on me. i can’t tell you whether i have anxiety because i believed i had a heart-related issue, or if i began feeling chest/ heart issues *because* of anxiety. it’s all been very confusing to me but i’m at the point where i feel like i need to try some form of medication. i tried l-theanine as my first trial, but i found this to be ineffective. does anyone have any recommendations for natural remedies that actually work (before i go to my primary doctor and request a rx)? about ten years ago, i had a doctor tell me that she believed i was depressed — and i very well may have been because i was 23 and having a very rough time figuring out what to do with my life — she ended up prescribing a few different ssris for me to try out. i ultimately stopped taking them because a) one of them made me feel hungover each morning and another one gave me sexually related side effects, and b) at some point, i figured out how to deal with my shit on my own and found a way to be happy again without medication. **tl;dr** - does anyone have any recommendations for natural remedies that actually work (before i go to my primary doctor and request a rx)? and are there any prescriptions that my fellow gentlemen have taken that haven’t given them any side effects?",2018-02-11 05:31:51,Azrael351,1
apkwhz,i suck at interviews,offmychest,i have had so many in the past. some jobs when offered the position i was so happy like “wow they must have liked me”. then upon going there on the first day i find out they’ve hired about 15 other people. obviously they were just hiring anyone. sometimes i give a really good interview and really feel like i got a good chance then get turned down. i think there’s only been one job i’ve got which i was the only candidate chosen. all the other jobs they hired practically everyone. it’s not great to hear when you have low self esteem. it gives my ego a real hit as i practice so hard for every interview. i just feel like it’s down to my personality. maybe i’m not a likeable enough person or something. it’s not like i’m going for jobs out of my depth. they’re for minimum wage type jobs. i’m 29 for christ sakes. usually they’ll say i gave a good interview and some generic reason why i wasn’t chosen like i didn’t have relevant experience. i was told i didn’t get a job as a barista because there was others with more experience even though i’ve been working in cafes for over a year. i have had some mental health issues which i guess when mentioned might not work in my favour. but this has been going on way before that. i have an interview soon for a financial administrator which i feel is a respectable position but i’m worried my recent experience will work against me. when they know i’m 29 years old and have made no progress in my career.,2019-02-11 22:55:55,Bipolarapparently,1
aotzy5,how unhappy do you have to be to be suicidal?,depression,"i’m not suicidal but i don’t really care too much about living a long life. i have no ambition and no long term goals. work is the bane of my life and i’ll likely have to do it until i die. i don’t have any interesting hobbies or passions about anything. i don’t like myself very much. i don’t want to die now but ideally maybe in my 60s. with my lifestyle it could happen sooner than that. but yeah it’s a genuine question because i hear people all the time mention how they’ll kill themselves. i think a lot of people throw this term around a lot maybe but don’t mean it. i might hate myself but i don’t hate my life. i’m always worried about future like financial stuff mainly. i only care about surviving while i can and if i can do that comfortably then great. some stuff in my life is good. i have mental health money, i have a gf, and i have family and somewhat of a social life although it’s rare i actually go out at all these days. anyone else in a similar boat?",2019-02-09 18:48:49,Bipolarapparently,1
aoamyd,not sure if i wear a mask or where this even comes from,depression,to some people i’m probably pretty confident and happy. i can joke around enjoy stuff. i am high functioning. i’m not currently working but it’s not an issue as i have money coming in and i’m looking for work now. i have a girlfriend and a few friends i’m really good at being myself around. from time to time i let out a really pathetic side to me. as a man i don’t want to be seen as a ‘snowflake’ my sensitive side usually comes online. i don’t really have a great online presence on any forum or anything. but i do use many platforms for like life advice or reassurance or to complain about my situation whatever it is at the time. i also do it to my mum a lot. maybe i am autistic or something but words seem to come out. i don’t feel happy or sad but i must have some emotions deep inside that i must bottle up. it’s like i just go on random rants about quite embarrassing or uninteresting issues. i become very self absorbed and i don’t know why i do it. i don’t really know how else to explain it. maybe i’m just childish or maybe i’m just seriously fucked up,2019-02-08 02:20:30,Bipolarapparently,1
anl6g3,need to stop self pitying,depression,"i need to stop self pitying or contemplating my situation. i am not severely depressed. i feel addicted to feeling sorry for myself though. i just need to go on a rant sometimes. i start picking apart my life bit by bit and i like to share online a lot of to my family. i know most people couldn’t give a fuck about my story. i guess i was a bit of a badass/lad at school but now i’m not. i feel washed up since school. right now it’s getting to me that i don’t work. i have disability money but i’m concerned that it will stop soon because i’m better mentally recently. i am looking for a job but every day i have to think about it or talk about it to someone. i worry i won’t hold down a job because i’ve usually just quit because i dread it so much. this is just an example of things i worry about. sometimes when i’m really in self pitying mood i will say i have no personality and other horrible things about myself. i have a girlfriend but i keep this under wraps when she’s around. i don’t really feel like my mood is that lowgenerally. my life could be a lot worse. they say self pity is addictive so perhaps that’s it. i can make interesting conversation and be witty when i want to be. i am not as sociable as i used to be. i’m a lot less outgoing than i used to be too. but time to time my mood will be in deep analytical mode. i feel like venting my problems or so called problems will alleviate some of it somehow. like someone will say something magical to make my situation better. i want to improve but it always seems like my personality holds me back. i worry that this is my life in 5th gear as good as i will ever be, i have a girlfriend but i feel like deep down i’m a bit of a loser still. if i can hold down a job i guess on the outside i’m not missing much. i don’t think self pitying is really me as it is something i picked up on in recent years. i used to self pity or give that impression only to family. someone told me to seek help online and i’ve become addicted to it. i don’t do it like everyday but now and again it feels good to vent. when i’m manic i just act plain weird too. i know a lot of people act a bit cooky when manic but mines different. it’s like i’m a bit of an animal. i will say horrible things to people. sometimes i say things that don’t even make sense or do things that don’t make sense. i can also post excessively on facebook lots of cringeworthy unintelligible shit. i feel like this has slightly ruined my reputation further. anyway anyone got any tips to stop these moods i can find myself getting into? or what’s even causing it? i don’t believe i have depression because a. i could write a really sad post online where the words just splurge out then get a phone call from someone and be perfectly chirpy and b. i don’t really get long periods of it. my mood can change throughout the day. i don’t even feel sad but i guess i have a lot of negative underlying beliefs about myself that i just need to spill to someone. it feels so good to let it out. but i don’t know why i do it",2019-02-06 03:11:04,Bipolarapparently,1

9lxzcx,"i'm having great difficulty with relationships and always look at the negative, and bad. i'm currently very stressed and anxious (more details inside)",mentalhealth,"hi everyone. im male, 19, from england. ive always had problems with relationships starting with my first at the age of around 15. everything starts off wonderful, but as i grow more attached, i start getting very depressed. ill ask all sorts of questions, such as have you ever smoked, drugs, gotten drunk, fornication, etc. ill get severely depressed if i get an answer i dont like (i must say i never ever get angry at anyone, i know the problems with me). even when it comes to games, or app games (flappy bird when that was common, piano tiles, etc.) if im being beaten, i have to keep playing until i win or ill get severely depressed, and feel worthless. this is how it was with my first relationship, until my feelings virtually went for her entirely. she ended up being literally crazy though so it didnt end up mattering too much, haha. unfortunately though, my 2nd relationship when i was 18 was much better and worse at the same time. i started a long distance relationship with someone. we had everything in common, still do. she was a little older than me. i still asked the same questions, and every answer was what i wanted to hear, (we were both born jehovahs witnesses which may be the reason why i have such strong feeling about those sorts of questions). however, she did watch a lot of movies, which is fine, but that included violent and horror movies, which again, i got severely depressed about. i would search for films and ask her if shes seen it, which she usually had. again, i would get depressed. we played piano tiles, i got obsessed, i would constantly check all her scores and make sure she wasnt winning. if she was, id have to play until i did better, if i couldnt, id feel worthless. she was however, everything i ever wanted. she was perfect for me. we spoke for for what must have been thousands of hours, sent over 250,000 messages to each other over the course of a couple of years. after a year of being together though, my feelings began to fade, even though i knew she was perfect. it was almost as if i wanted the challenge of starting a relationship, i dont know. around when my stress and depression from being so obsessed started, my physically health really went bad. i suffered from constant nausea, some days i couldnt eat anything, and that has continued until now. even though we were amazing friends, we decided it might be best to call things off as i was always negative about everything. we didnt talk for around 9 months, until a few days ago when i messaged her again. shes still a beautiful person, amazing friend, and would do anything for me. however, she now has a bf, and is living with him, which im really struggling with. i believe i still have feelings for her, which is really difficult for me. my physical health is starting to get worse because im thinking about her living with him, having sex, and even though i know there isnt really anything wrong with that, my stupid mind is really not allowing me to believe that. my physical health is starting to get worse, my feelings for her are starting to get stronger again, but i know ill be depressed and anxious and make the same mistakes as always whatever happens. i dont want to lose her again, as a friend or anything else, because weve both missed each other a lot, and it wouldnt be fair on her either, but i cant allow my physical health to get as bad as it was again. shes genuinely perfect, beautiful, and she would never do a bad thing to anyone, which is why i hate my mind so much for not only ruining it in the first place, but for getting me feeling this way now, both with my feelings for her, and the depression im getting into again. if i forget about her and start a relationship in the future, the same will happen, those questions, anxiety, depression, and obsession. im sorry if this was difficult to read but i truly dont know how to write it any other way. thank you for any help!

aimki4,one of my roommates obnoxiously loves disney and i’m honestly starting to lose the patience for it.,offmychest,"ever since i was a kid, i’ve always hated disney, both as a creative studio and as a corporation. i’ve tried to give them a chance, i’ve watched many of their movies as a child, and growing up in la my parents often took me and my little brother to disneyland. i don’t want to go into detail about *why* i hate them so much because everyone in grade school always provoked that argument out of me, because every disney fan i’ve met seems to think they’re always right and have tried to get me to suddenly love disney harder than a preacher shoving the bible down an atheist kid’s throat. and the harder they try to convince me, the more i end up hating disney as a whole. so please, *please* don’t try to convert me into a disney lover in the comments. i don’t like disney movies (with the sole exceptions of wall e and stitch), so please let me dislike them in peace.well, after putting up with these arguments in grade school, i have found myself to be cursed once again, because before i moved into my apartment this year, one of my roommates asked if her friend could move in with us. her explanation of this friend was “she’s really sweet and she loves disney.” now, i’m not about to judge someone for loving something i don’t like, different people like different things, and that’s ok. i felt for her friend because not being able to find housing is tough, and she wasn’t even gonna move in the bedroom i was in. so of course i said yes, but i refused to tell her or anyone else that i hated disney. making that mistake in grade school quickly turned into a competition to see who could get me to like disney first, and it made me even more sick of the corporation. i didn’t want to go through with that again.but holy fuck that was a huge mistake.despite the other four of us not being as crazy of disney fans as her, she keeps decorating the apartment with disney stuff. she writes walt disney quotes on the living room whiteboard. she made monster inc cutouts for the front door. she drew pictures of dumbo and eeyore bathing for the bathroom. i felt irked because she’s not even asking anyone if they’re ok with it, she’s just placing decoration after decoration with no word until every goddamn room in the apartment feels like the disney store. and i just can’t forget about it. but i tell myself, “damn, she’s put so much effort into this. she’ll be graduating this year. if i can stay patient, i’ll let her have her fun, and then there will be no conflict. how bad can it get?”and then right now, at 4:18 in the morning, as i got up from bed to take a late night piss in the only bathroom we have, my drowsy self gets rudely awakened by a fucking shower curtain of the disney castle.fucking. *hell.*i don’t know if it’s because i’m tired or something, but that really, really drew the line for me. don’t people ask before just placing an eyesore decoration in an already tiny *public* room? look, i really fucking love pokémon, and i have many obnoxious pokémon decorations in my room, but they *stay* in my room. because that is a *private* room. i don’t force people to put pokémon in their everyday lives. so why the fuck does disney have to be in my everyday life?! every time i go unlock the front door, every time i take a piss, every time i wash my face or sit on the couch in the living room. disney is there. they’re already everywhere. they own half the movies and have taken part in most of the others. fuck off from my life already!it doesn’t help that i’m *already* being patient with this roommate with other things. many things bother her, so she has a rack of her own private dishware and brings in her own coffee machine and stuff while the rest of us share because there is honestly no room in this small kitchen for five people to have their own set of things. she moves other people’s things around because she doesn’t agree where they are instead of telling the roommate to move them. she is insanely picky about little things like which appliances get to be on the counter, how we use aluminum foil, where we put stuff, etc. she told me to put my george foreman grill away in my already small pantry space but she gets to have her own keurig coffee machine on the counter?! this isn’t only her apartment. holy fuck. but i get her reasoning, i started using my own dish sponge, soap and towels because the public sponge/towels are always dirty and for some reason everyone else dilutes the dish soap and i can’t get shit cleaned with water soap. so again, i keep my patience.aside from the disney shit, i communicate things i have a problem with because she sure as hell doesn’t have a problem with doing that either, but she won’t change. fuck, if i even told her about my problems with the disney stuff she’ll be even more fed up with me. i’ve been lucky enough to never have an issue with a roommate before, and my other three roommates and i are on chill terms. and i really want to be on chill terms with this fifth roomie as well. she isn’t all bad, she gave me a futurama poster when she found out i liked the show. but damn. my patience is starting to run thin. i’m even starting to question myself, whether i’m in the wrong or not. fuck, i just really needed to let this out, because frankly i feel like i’m not allowed to say this anywhere else.thank you for listening. maybe i can try to get back to sleep now.",2019-01-22 14:56:10,AwesomeDragon101,1
a3l1ci,"honestly, i’m ready to collapse at any moment.",offmychest,"i know this is a stressful week for many of us. finals are coming up soon. i’ve been on campus for over twelve hours a day to go to classes, do labs, and study for the last few tests before finals come over. the camp fire caused school to close for two weeks, and because of that many professors have shoved even more material towards the last week of schooling because they cannot afford to miss that many lectures in a quarter system. on this week alone i had to do two massive homework assignments, two lab reports, a lab session that was two labs in one to make up for what we missed, and study for a test in two days. half the material on that test is shit that wasn’t covered in lecture, shit we have to teach ourselves because the prof didn’t want to accept that school was cancelled and gave us a ton of difficult material to self study to make up for that lost time. i can teach myself many things, but not ochem. and that’s just for my organic chemistry class, whose final is three days after that last test. i also have a biology lab practical exam tomorrow morning and a paper due for my ge class, among other things. i have no idea when i’m gonna be able to study for my finals.honestly, i’ve forgotten how to take care of myself. i’m living off of energy drinks because daily 8ams are taking a toll on me. i’m not getting sleep, i’m not showering. my eyes hurt to the point where i had to take a couple short naps today. every day it feels like forever before i can get home. i want to pass organic chemistry so badly, i really don’t want to retake it. and the professor doesn’t fucking curve anything except for the final exam despite the class average being a d or lower. i’m not even thinking about my other classes at this point. which is sad because i enjoyed my other classes. it just sucks that because of the stupid fires, most professors have no choice but to make the last two weeks of an already fast-paced quarter system even more stressful.at least i know i’m not alone. every other student i’ve talked to feels the same about that class. the homework, despite its whole purpose being to help learn the material, feels like another test because it punishes you for every attempt you make at an answer. the system is fucked, we’re all driven to the point where we’re laughing due to loss of sanity. at least i haven’t met a person who is confident about that class. maybe the curve on the final exam will save our asses.to the professors of my ans and ge classes, thank you guys for actually giving a shit about student health. giving us information about the crisis while we were house-ridden and constantly reminding us to take care of ourselves. i swear to god, it is so freaking hard to find stem professors that actually give a shit. so thank you guys for offering a shred of humanity.i’m gonna go study. fuck my life.",2018-12-06 07:38:59,AwesomeDragon101,1

9lhdik,"last night, i was thanked because my venting sounded “good.”",offmychest,"the mind has odd ways of manifesting thoughts into your head. last night, i left class at 8pm, walking across campus with the cool breeze stroking my face. my heart felt constricted, my thoughts racing. unwelcome feelings entered in unexplained ways for unknown reasons, and my mind soon numbed me. the only way i could escape this numb state is by quelling the voices in my head with music.the melodies that enter my head are arbitrary, yet they always follow the same pattern: a 2-5-2-3-5 chord progression. i don’t know why my creativity is so limited, but that’s the only way my mind feels like it’s properly expressing itself. whatever sequence of notes decides to crowd my head will do so on repeat, over and over again, until my mind is fogged into an endless and frustrating cycle...i could no longer avoid the war behind the negative voices and distracted music. i needed a release, so i wandered into the one building on campus that had a piano.it was 8:15, nobody was playing. the building was almost empty, which meant fewer people could see me at my most vulnerable state. with the piano as my therapist, i spoke my mind in those keys that night.only to be interrupted mid-session with a thank you for the beautiful music.i wished my shyness didn’t overcome me. i wished i didn’t feel so naked, so horribly raw. i did not know how to reply, for i do not play music. i have one fully written song; the rest is improvised filler. the filler that only barely prevents my racing thoughts from being destructive, the same six broken chords supporting it. anybody can feel how repetitive my playing is. i use the same broken chords, similar melodies, i only occasionally change my scale to spice things up but i would not call what i play “entertaining.” calming? sure. therapeutic? ok. but only because it was already in my head, and i am merely putting it out there. if somebody were to watch you break your thoughts down with a therapist, they would not call it majestic, would they? for this reason, i never play in front of others, i dislike performing. yet last night, two people at two different times thanked me for playing.to those students, i am sorry i do not know how to feel. i cannot play anywhere without being approached and i am not sure how to react. i am glad my ranting through music did not disturb your studies. i’m glad that my coping mechanism simultaneously brought peace to not only myself, but to you as well. i just hope that i will never disappoint you by my lack of songs, for i am not a musician.i am just a depressed person with a piano.",2018-10-05 03:09:36,AwesomeDragon101,1

9bp7bl,"by having the happiest season in a while, i have killed my only way to vent.",offmychest,"this time last year, i’d sit in front of my piano.my mind, my heart would feel bottled up with emotions i could not share without a filter, emotions i was unable to express even in drawing. and then one man told me i could write music, so i poured my soul out onto the keyboard.music has a way of taking feelings that are inexplainable in words and communicate them in a way that could only be described as obscure and beautiful. i used to take the worst of my depression, shut out the surroundings with headphones, and vent through creating music. it was like a vocal journal log that only i could understand, what sounded like music was the way i recorded those specific heart-wrenching feelings of the past. but nobody could tell how screwed up i was.i never showed anyone what i created, save for one person. and even he only knew a fraction of what i wrote because i was ashamed of my own music. a creator who hates their own creation, i didn’t think my music was half as great as what people told me. i kept what i wrote hidden from the world and rarely wrote what i played.but then i left home for a year and was separated from my instrument. i could not afford my own piano, and the time i had in my university’s music room was extremely limited. my time writing music has become more distant and more scarce. and i slowly began forgetting my theory.college has been amazing. i have made new friends and pursued my long-wished studies of animal science. i could not be happier, and with joy i had fewer feelings to ventilate, and i slowly lost my reason to write music. i already am terrible at writing efficiently, i only ever finished one song. a wonderful song that i can never match. and the rest are fragments i can never complete because my writing and playing is only a shadow of what it once was. i was my only critic when i was great at it, and because of that i killed the only remedy to my depression. i despise myself for it, and i’m trying to play music once more but i am unable to turn my newfound frustration into something beautiful. i lost that ability and i never got a chance to value it. i used to feel satisfaction and release from turning my demons into something people can enjoy, and even then i was too hard on myself so i hardly showed what i wrote to anyone. and now that i’ve lost that skill, i’ll never create anything again. i have so many songs left unfinished. even my sketchbook is filled with half finished drawings. i’d give anything, *anything* to be good at art again.",2018-08-31 04:02:50,AwesomeDragon101,1

aos7kv,my dad's girlfriend purposefully reported my dad for fraud for having me and my little brother on his health insurance.,offmychest,"this is a long ass story and im writing it on mobile, so if it looks funky, my apologies. ill answer the question most people probably have at first. how could your dad be reported for fraud for having his children on his health insurance? the man im referring to as my ""dad"" is not legally or biologically my father. he is a man my mom married when i was 3 years old and filled the empty father figure position my brother and i had, happily. i am forever grateful to have had a father figure throughout my childhood, and i know my brother is too. my mom and him split up when i was about 12 years old. for anybody whose wondering im a 20 year old female and my brother is 18. this story is very long. but i seriously need to get this off my chest. my dad has been in a relationship with this woman for about 5 years now (maybe a little less.) i was never really a huge fan of her, but i was always nice and respectful towards her. the first times she started to bother me was when i was around 17 years old. my dad has always said to me ""if you ever need anything, let me know."" so when i was 17 i had to take night classes for school(another long story, but i skipped a bunch of classes and had to make up for it in night classes) i didnt get my license until i was 18 years old, and since my mom had to work 2 jobs, one of them being at night, i didnt always have a secure ride to my night classes. so on the days i couldnt find a ride from friends, i would call up my dad and ask him for a ride. no big deal considering thats how my dad and i have always operated. i need something, i let him know. so his girlfriend started saying shit like ""oh why is she asking such short notice, she didnt know she needed a ride yesterday?!"" which is a reasonable thing to get annoyed by, i guess, but my dad has never been one for planning. he doesnt know anybodys birthday, lol i he literally thought he turned 49 this year, but hes 48. thats just how he is, yanno? hes never been an organized ""oh lets plan a day to hang out"" no, before he lived with his girlfriend, when i wanted to see my dad, i would just show up at his house. he never cared. but his girlfriend is very organised and likes plan shit and whatever. so that was the first incident that pissed me off, and there have been many, but for the purpose of making sure this post isnt ridiculously long, im going to fast forward. in april of my senior year, my mom quit her job that was making his extremely fucking depressed. she was working 2 jobs, but she quit her full time, and started working her second job full time. but she only had one income. eventually she got an eviction notice so we had to suddenly move to a different town in with her boyfriend. we asked our dad if we could use his address so we can continue going to the same school, considering i was he graduating in 2 months and my brother was graduating the following year (he moved into his girlfriends house, which is in the same town my brother and i went to school in.) my dad said it was okay for us to use his address. he failed to tell his girlfriend about this, because shes made if obvious in the past she has something against me and my brother. i speculate its because were not biologically his children and shes jealous because were another womans children. but anyways she ends up getting some of my mail delivered to her house and she was not happy. she contacted my mom saying how this is lying and she wants nothing to do with it, telling my mom she should of considered me and my brother before she got an eviction notice. which is understandable. anyways my dads girlfriend  starts treating to tell the school that we dont live in the town anymore, which would suck because my brother and i had gone to school there our entire lives. i started getting involved with arguing with my dads girlfriend because i was kind of sick of her shit at this point. she started to threaten to report my dad for fraud for having us on his health insurance. wtf right?? my dad has always told all of us(he has 3 kids of his own too, my ""step"" siblings) that he wants us on his health insurance until were 26 years old. (thats the longest a parent can have children on their health insurance in my america. my state at least.) and what kind of person threatens something like that??? anyways that all happened about a year ago.fast forward to now. the first month of september my dad called my and started telling me that ""things are going to be changing."" i wasnt quite sure of what he meant, but to me it sounded like he was leaving his girlfriend. which i have been hoping he would do for years now. but he hasnt. fast forward to mid october he contacts my mom( on a secret phone he has to hide from his girlfriend because his regular phone is in her name and she blocked my moms number on it) and tells her that his work is cracking down on the legitimacy of insurance and that my brother and i are no longer going to be able to be on his insurance. he said we should be good until the end of the year. mid october. fast forward to now.  my mom got a notice from my dentist that my my insurance had been cancelled on september 1st. wtf?!?!?! and my dad didnt tell us until mid october. and i specifically remember that my dad called me the first week of september to tell me things were going to be changing. it makes a lot more sense to me that his girlfriend fucking reported my dad for fraud, just like she threatended. and i found out from my aunt( my dads sister) that my dad had left his girlfriend recently and went to my aunts house. my dads girlfriend showed up there and waiting outside in the driveway in her car until my dad got back in. just fucking waited there. i dont know why nobody called the fucking cops. theres not much of a conclusion her other than my dad is wasting his life with a fucking sociopath who has a resentment towards me and my brother. id be interested in hearing other perspectives and let me know if you have questions because there is so much other bullshit i left out for the sake of keeping this as short as possible.

9tyu2o,here is some advice ... might help.,depression,"i used to be very depressed and did a little research and made some changes, and i wanted to offer a little help to aid you to get through your day.1. people who are suicidal often dont want to kill themselves, but rather they just want their pain inside to end. when you get to that point, talk to others. understand that you just want this pain to end. coming to terms with that pain and accepting that pain, will put you in a place to find coping mechanisms. things like exercise, diet, caffeine, short and long term goals are good at coping with your daily depression. they dont cure it, only help cope. seeing a doctor might help you find ways to treat the depression.2. social media and its role on influencing you. when the mtv beach house first appeared, young adults went nuts because they wanted to live rent free with hot models in miami. unfortunately thats a fantasy world for the very rich and 99% of us dont really live like that. instagram is full of models who travel the world and go on adventures, and for those of us who work 9-5 at starbucks, its often making us hate ourselves because we feel like a failure that we are not living this amazing life. its very detrimental on your psyche to see this over and over and over. you need to understand that everyone has bad break ups, everyone cries, everyone has bad days. the hardest diamond can still break. 99.9% of us dont live that life.3. understanding envy, and directional goals. so, pre-internet, i would visit my friends house, and he would have some cool new toy or some cool new thing. he and i playing with whatever video game system or action figure made me happy, and i wanted one too. i had envy. i would go to museum gift shops, and want the cool statue of dinosaurs because i wanted to share it my friend and be like look at this cool dino i got. there is a lot that goes into envy and whats cool and the world has changed so much now. for starters, people dont go over each others houses like before. people dont buy stuff like before, and share like before. friendships are different now also.  here is an example of envy. for example, martha stewart did a show on tv where every day she made women around the us feel guilty that they werent a real woman because they couldnt cook like her, and could afford the blender, or oven, or crock pot, or whatever else she was selling. people got depressed watching her show and when she did jail time for insider trading the public loved it because of how awful she made them feel. youtube videos are often carefully crafted to sell products, and part of that is to guilt you or psychologically make you want to get something. you are overwhelmed daily with 2,000 advertisements for millions of products. all of this contributes to feelings of inadequacy and depression. i encourage all of you to write down things you want and try and determine why you want these things and if you need them or if you were heavily marketed to.hope my advice helps even one person. keep on fighting!",2018-11-04 01:35:15,tommygunz007,1

5cw6sa,don't feel guilty about being depressed; for me it was a reaction to the insecurity of society.,depression,"theres nothing wrong with any of us. not a thing.were all human beings, and were all imperfect. for years i made the mistake of thinking that productive, or so-called successful people, are actually winners. its this western society we live in: it wants to use and abuse you for its own ends, so from the moment youre born it stresses the importance of work to you. of productivity. of looking respectable. of chasing the dream. it wants you to buy this, behave like that, say this and criticize that. it does this because it wants things that you have - it wants your labour, your money, and most importantly it wants your personality. are we really winners if we sell ourselves to it? no. we should pursue individual satisfaction.it wants to take your personality and mould it into whatever it wants. it doesnt care if you love, for example, music. it doesnt care how sincerely you love the act of playing/creating, it only cares about how much it can make from you. a label wont sign you unless you make music that will sell. its frowned upon to be in a band and to write songs and not aim to make it. open your eyes. this applies to everything around you. society freaks out when you do something truly for yourself. it attacks you; why make music if not to sell it? why write a book if not to sell it? why climb a mountain if not to post a photo online? why spend a few hours alone in the forest, examining different types of flowers/trees/animals? thats weird. right? thats what weve grown up being told. that if youre not going to the gym to keep fit, going out drinking to socialize, going to work for satisfaction, getting married to have kids, that youre weird? that there’s something wrong with you? but why should we have to believe that?so many people are so brainwashed and insecure. social skills are such an effective mask for insecurity. i know so many people who have been in loads of relationships over the years, and have proven that they have no problem finding a new one when one ends, and yet these are horrible, abusive, insecure, insulting, cruel people. but were not like that. people who suffer from depression have so much more empathy than people whove spent their whole lives using everyone around them to feel good about themselves. these people are afraid to stand out. they all have to pretend to be normal every day, and how boring do their lives look?fuck that. do what you want. in my opinion there is no purpose/destiny/fate. i dont feel compelled to do anything, but yet i like to play guitar and record songs in my bedroom. it’s not a passion; i don’t have one. yet i can still get up in the morning and be excited for the day, because i live how i like. sure, i don’t feel destined to do anything but i still like guitar. i still like steak, so i’ll have a steak for dinner. i still like films so i’ll go to the cinema. you see, your dreams may be hurting you. i used to dream of being a world famous musician, and of being a social master. but i realized one day that what i really wanted here was people’s the acceptance, which was never going to happen the way i visualized. reality is so complex, there’s no way that it will ever conform to something that you visualized in your head.the way i see it, you have no control over the world outside of you. everything happens regardless of what you do. you can influence the world, yes, but you can’t control it. likewise, you can’t control the world inside of you either. you can’t choose to not think a thought, or to unthink one once it has been thought. you can’t unfeel an emotion, you can’t unlike something. you can suppress and ignore everything yes, but once again you can’t control it. but you can control your reactions to all this. someone insults you, you don’t have to accept it. sure, the insult occurred, and you heard it and understood it, but it doesn’t have to affect you because you had no control over that person anyway. find happiness in your reactions. see the world in front of you and listen to your internal emotions/thoughts and react how you want. pursue your dreams in the real world, don’t let your perfect visions burn you out because they’re never going to happen the way you envision.i used to feel depressed and weird about not giving a damn about ninety nine percent of what i see around me. but i dont feel weird about it anymore. i realize that society is a deeply insecure thing populated by deeply insecure people who dont want you to have a rich, individual experience. they want to drag you down to their level, where they have to make fun of anyone different, talk about people behind their backs just to have something to talk about, get drunk four nights a week just so they can feel normal. all we want is to be free of depression.for me, this viewpoint has been the beginning of a pathway out. i know that many of you may be a lot more depressed than me, and i understand if this wont work. this might only be my understanding of how to help myself. but look, in brief: society is afraid of people who want to have an individual experience. a lot of depressed people are disillusioned with society, but feel bad for being like this. well, dont feel bad. an individual experience is worth so much more than a mediocre, pre-defined one. want to stay in bed for a day? do if you want to. want to go to the pub? do if you want to. want to go in search of a flower in the forest? do if you want to. but only if you want to. and remember that when someone makes fun of you or mocks you for doing what you wanted to do, that’s just them acting out of insecurity. have your beautiful personal experiences and don’t worry about the insecure society and its insecure people. find your happiness in what you can control and let the moment happen.",2016-11-14 16:27:24,fenix_funk,1
5apb9b,reality hitting me,depression,"this has been a long time coming, but after all these years its finally hitting me how shit my life is.i can barely get up in the morning. my room is an absolute mess which reflects me. when i hear that there are visitors downstairs i dont want to go down. i dont want to put them through my mediocrity. i dont want to make small talk or listen to their stories, but not because theres anything wrong with them; i just wish that i didnt exist. i wish there was no me to come downstairs.i fucked up my college registration and now i might be failing a module, no matter how well i do in it. if this happens, ill have to tell my parents, who will go insane. they take education incredibly seriously and if i were to have to do a repeat they would kill me.im losing my friends. i dont know what to say to anyone anymore. the only thing i can talk about where i have something real to say is mental health, and no one wants to spend a long time talking about that. im scared of going to large gatherings where home isnt within walking distance, because i always end up close to tears with anxiety and need to walk home and go to bed, where i feel even worse for giving in and leaving. i want to cut all ties with my friends and just let them be happy without me. id miss them but id be glad.ive worked in the same job for a year and a half and i dont have a friendly relationship with anyone. they all get on fine except me. i spend the whole day thinking about suicide. i think about suicide a lot. a lot of the time when i unlock my phone in the morning itll still be on the same suicide methods webpage i was reading when i fell asleep the night before. im always exhausted yet i hate going to bed because i dont want the morning to come. when it does come im afraid to leave.i dont know who i am anymore. i used to like things, now ive lost interest but i keep doing the same things because theres nothing else to do. none of my hobbies are social. in my spare time i sit on my bed and stare at the wall and just dream of non-existence. i dont live in a country where you can buy guns but if i did id write notes to everyone i know right now and then kill myself. im not scared of death but i am scared of what would happen if a suicide method went wrong. i dont want to end up even worse off than i am now. i just want it to work.i dont want money, or a job, or even friends. i just want to feel normal but that probably wont happen, so what i really want is to die in my sleep. i want to go into a deep, beautiful sleep and pass away. i dont want anything more than this. there are a lot of things that i would miss. i would miss music, old friends, nature. but none of these things can solve the problem i have and i cant solve it either. i dont want to be like this when im thirty or forty. theres no point in carrying on if this is what my life is going to be.  theres no point. im scared of the world, of being honest, of telling the truth, of being vulnerable, of talking to people, of being depressed, of making promises, of saying yes...of everything. i am depressed and i need help but id rather die and everyone says that they care about me and they do, but its not enough. all the love in the world cant help someone who cant love themselves. i really, really need help. i really, really do.",2016-11-02 13:21:35,fenix_funk,0

(god wants me to do this, aliens are coming, seeing things...).i honestly think that with the right medication and right counseling, people will mental health issues are blessed with hyper awareness of reality. it is not some sort of “super power”. it is just something that we have. we are hyper aware of reality and it makes us go “crazy” as some regular folks would say.mental health is not a joke. we are not crazy. we are not blessed (even tho we could potentially use it for good). we are only burdened with the weight of reality that so many normal people forget.if you just forget for a moment that you are the center of your world and meditate on the fact that we all are extras in someone else’s world, i think that by taking attention off yourself, you will feel less pressure and less anxiety and less depression. i say less... it will never be completely gone. many of is are stuck with a life long struggle. and you have the choice and ability to live a balanced life which is at war with your mind.with the help of medication, counseling, group therapy, music, art, dancing, relationships, god, religion, politics, friends, nature... i believe that you can do this. you can live a good life. you will get better with time.i have a motto: life will eventually get worse, but it will also eventually get better.",2019-01-27 16:21:42,oeimili,0

but i would fantasize a lot about it, wondering how i would do it, who would care, and when the best time to do it would be. i grew up in a strict christian household that forbade just about everything i found joy in. no rock music allowed, no reading my favorite books including harry potter, no playing cards, no watching movies unless the director and cast were devout christians. i was taught to never question god and always obey my father whose word was final. because of this, i learned to never voice my opinions because doing so would often result in insanely long lectures, sometimes lasting half the day, 6+ hours, about how i was wrong and need to listen to him. my mother always followed his say, repressing her own feelings and attitudes for 26 years of their marriage until finally they divorced when i was 11 and all the built-up repression spewed out. my dad was a trucker who was gone a week or 2 at a time, but from 11+ onward most of my memories with them are about them arguing over every single thing imaginable (also, though divorced neither of them could afford to live separately from each other, so this is what i grew up with for the rest of my adolescence). so while my father was entirely tyrannical, my mother justifiably couldnt take it anymore. however, since then she has always had the victim mentality that still continues today. everything is always somebody elses fault, she is never the one to blame, and she will never take responsibility even when she is clearly the cause. when i moved out to attend university, i felt a huge weight was taken off my shoulders but another weight had replaced it. i was away from my familys toxicity, but in my classes i was learning about all this horrible stuff happening in the world which only seemed continual with no sense of relief and no hope of change. i abandoned religion when i was 16, so i couldnt find comfort in god. my social history is that of an introverted-extrovert; i was sociable and happy for the most part, had friends but not really any close friends since moving away from my hometown, and while i genuinely was happy and not completely enveloped in depression, it was also partly a facade for deeper negative emotions i didnt want others to see. overall, for most of my college experience i felt alone with nowhere to really find comfort and possessing a world view that the purpose of life was to try to find a light with a paper bag taped over your head. while for most of my life my livelihood has been in a negative state, recently i can say that all of it has changed. at age 20 i went on a road trip with my brother and during the drive he was trying to tell me to see the beauty of the world and that i shouldnt be so negative, but i wasnt listening. i just quietly dismissed everything he was talking about. when we reached our destination i consented to try mushrooms, and because of this i witnessed a completely different mode of consciousness that finally made me realize the nonsense of my state. i witnessed my first dis-association from my thoughts and finally felt free from this constant burden of mine. this experience opened me up afterwards to see with fresh eyes what i would normally have condemned and left unexplored. i became fascinated with psychology to know why my brain works the way it does, rediscovered meaning through religion (though it is not entirely conventional), and started questioning other cases of how i, myself, was the cause of my own suffering. i finally understood what my brother was talking about during the drive and wept at how i was purposefully blinding myself from seeing the light, only adding more tape to the bag over my head because it was the only thing i knew how to do.i see a lot of posts in here condemning other people for naive comments on how to just be happy. a lot of posts blame other things for their continual state of depression whether it be chemical deficiencies, other people, or societys mold placed over you on how you should be. i am not totally naive to physiological and other biological causes for depression, but i must say i dont think i can ever fully comprehend what its like without personally being affected by it. i understand it to be something way out of peoples conscious control, and for that i could only wish to have more empathy than i do now. however, i have to question is it your identification as the depressed one, the sufferer, the victim maintaining those chemical deficiencies? is it your original world view constructed and reinforced through countless years of conditioning causing this? like my mother, i too identified as the victim until i found the state of consciousness aware of my thoughts, and by being aware of them i was able to dis-associate from them similar to awakening from a dream that had taken place over my entire life.i see a lot of posts desiring to be understood by other people, for a social connection to their deeper layer of unhappiness. to this i say sure, i understand this desire. but are you simultaneously capable of understanding others not in your realm of thinking? we all have our own troubles and pain points, but it seems many of you prioritize your own above others. non-depressed people seem to have no idea what its like to be you, and many of you seem to have a drowners panic looking for a social connection to ease this state of depression youre in, but when a lifeguard comes to offer aid you try drowning him as well.after mushrooms i heard an analogy that depressed people are often like an abused shelter dog. because of its abuse the dog becomes programmed to show its teeth and growl in attempts to defend itself. even after the abuse has stopped, this programming becomes all it knows and the dog will navigate the world snarling in any uncomfortable situation, often causing more beatings that wouldnt have happened otherwise, only giving more reinforcement to snarl. i do not mean to use this as a demeaning analogy or claim that everything is your fault. but that your perpetual unhappiness becomes an endless loop that may have originated totally out of your control in the beginning, perhaps in childhood, but becomes an unnecessary conditioned response maintaining your unhappiness when it no longer should.i am not making this high-effort post to claim myself holier than thou. i am merely questioning if there is any possibility to escape this state of mind if it no longer suits you. if the answer is yes, i believe the answer is out there somewhere for you. even if its not this post, i dont care. i hope it points to a general direction.if the answer is a unanimous no, downvote me, call me out in the comments, ban me from the sub. maybe i will understand that i was incredibly more naive that i presumed. though maybe it takes an outsider to point out your own flaws, maybe even harshly, if you refuse to see them for yourself and take responsibility.for me the answer was right in my face the entire time but i was too preoccupied in my head to even understand it. the answer for me was simply ""to be"" and because of this ""to be happy"".",2019-01-10

989hd1,i cleaned my house for the first time in months.,depression,"i have bipolar with anxiety disorder. i used to go through life with an overall dull feeling on a normal day. when i dropped, i felt like killing myself every day for about a week and a half, then i would really cease to exist. i did the things i was supposed to; but i felt like i wasn’t there. then, came the highs. i would come up from my full existence to feeling astronomical. i could do ten times more than i normally could, i wouldn’t sleep for more than 2-3 hours, and it wasn’t good sleep, but i would only be irritable for about an hour and then have this pissed off energy. i spent money in excess to where i would have to ask my family for help because i would get evicted otherwise.i started on lamictal about two months ago. for the first time in a while, my ‘normal’ existence (feeling like any joy i had was surface level, but numb on the inside), actually felt like it had gone away. i felt vibrant and alive.i then saw my house for what it was, and realized that i had completely blocked out how i was living. there were bags of fast food everywhere. trash and cups and plates that had been used weeks ago were piled up on my side tables, and my clothes were everywhere except the hamper; even in my living room, and on the stairs and in the hallway. there were pans and pots literally stacked and had mold in them; there were maggots in them, too. i started crying. i felt really, truly happy, and then i felt a deep sorrow. it felt like i was mourning the loss of my life. the months that i didn’t really live, but existed only to work, sleep, overfeed myself or starve. i functioned because i had to, not because i had any desire to live.i’m writing this because after i cried, i stared at my wall for about an hour. i was lost in my thoughts and wondering what i should do. the anxiety kicked in. there was so much shit in my house to clean up, and i felt like i wouldn’t get it all done, and that i was disgusting and i couldn’t believe how i was living, and how my poor dog had just been there the entire time living in the filth i let grow.then i stopped. i snapped out of the trance. i went and got some trash bags and some cleaning supplies from down the road, came back and started just throwing shit away. i just finished my downstairs. i have some dishes to do, but i cleaned off all the maggots and eggs and mold and all the trash is gone. i can finally sit in my living room and actually see it and feel okay.i 100% would not have done this without all the therapy, and this drug that i truly believe is a miracle for me. i can see clearly. this isn’t a high, either. i’m tired as hell, and all i want to do is get some rest and snuggle my pup, who had been patiently sitting on the couch while i worked. i just feel good. not ecstatic and not energetic. just good. i never thought i would cherish the feeling of just that. just feeling good. i remember my ex girlfriend, who would come over and rag on me about how my house was dirty and she couldn’t live like that. i tried really hard to keep it clean for her, but i felt like there was a heavy weight on my chest that held me down and said ‘you’re tired. you don’t feel like it. you should just sleep, and clean it later.’ i remember he day she said. ‘well, when does it become an excuse?’tonight made it pretty clear to me that my depression is not an excuse. it’s a disease and a mental illness that sinks into your veins and into your bones, and into your eyes and your back and stomach. you literally feel like you’re sinking slowly into a muddy grave, and you can’t pull yourself out of it because your arms are too heavy with muck.if you’ve gotten through reading all of this, i want you to know something. i have tried to kill myself three times. i am twenty three years old. i used to think, ‘if i can just get through this year, maybe i can tough it out and cope with it, and feel better.’ i tried to. i know others have been successful at it. you can’t get that year back, though. i cannot get back my last ten years of feeling this way. not everything will work for you, but you have to keep trying so you can live. not exist, but really, really live. i think i made that first step tonight. i hope you can make it soon.",2018-08-18 08:51:46,ItsSatineActually,1

aefll3,is this a sub for finding motivation for overcoming depression or a sub to wallow in everyone's relatable experiences?,depression,"im new to this sub but almost all of the posts ive seen are relatable experiences of being in depression, and i have one question for you guys: what is your motivation for joining this sub? are you here because youve given up all hope on finding happiness but find comfort in being around people in the same state of mind as you or are you here with any shred of hope to find a way out? is it your ultimate desire to stay depressed or is there any hope at all

view that the purpose of life was to try to find a light with a paper bag taped over your head. while for most of my life my livelihood has been in a negative state, recently i can say that all of it

to question is it your identification as the depressed one, the sufferer, the victim maintaining those chemical deficiencies? is it your original world view constructed and reinforced through countless years of conditioning causing this? like my mother, i too identified as the victim until i found the state of consciousness aware of my thoughts, and by being aware of them i was able to dis-associate from them similar to awakening from a dream that had taken place over my entire life.i see a lot of posts desiring to be understood by other people, for a social connection to their deeper layer of unhappiness. to this i say sure, i understand this desire. but are you simultaneously capable of understanding others not in your realm of thinking? we all have our own troubles and pain points, but it seems many of you prioritize your own above others. non-depressed people seem to have no idea what its like to be you, and many of you seem to have a drowners panic looking for a social connection to ease this state of depression youre in, but when a lifeguard comes to offer aid you try drowning him as well.after mushrooms i heard an analogy that depressed people are often like an abused shelter dog. because of its abuse the dog becomes programmed to show its teeth and growl in attempts to defend itself. even after the abuse has stopped, this programming becomes all it knows and the dog will navigate the world snarling in any uncomfortable situation, often causing more beatings that wouldnt have happened otherwise, only giving more reinforcement to snarl. i do not mean to use this as a demeaning analogy or claim that everything is your fault. but that your perpetual unhappiness becomes an endless loop that may have originated totally out of your control in the beginning, perhaps in childhood, but becomes an unnecessary conditioned response maintaining your unhappiness when it no longer should.i am not making this high-effort post to claim myself holier than thou. i am merely questioning if there is any possibility to escape this state of mind if it no longer suits you. if the answer is yes, i believe the answer is out there somewhere for you. even if its not this post, i dont care. i hope it points to a general direction.if the answer is a unanimous no, downvote me, call me out in the comments, ban me from the sub. maybe i will understand that i was incredibly more naive that i presumed. though maybe it takes an outsider to point out your own flaws, maybe even harshly, if you refuse to see them for yourself and take responsibility.for me the answer was right in my face the entire time but i was too preoccupied in my head to even understand it. the answer for me was simply ""to be"" and because of this ""to be happy"".",2019-01-10

aeffqv,how do people do it...,depression,"  i dont understand how people just wake up and feel... i dunno... not like giving up? im beyond help, and am borderline to the point of finding the easiest way out, but im too fucking stubborn for that. like, every time my body wants to just collapse and not move, this little stubborn part of me just kicks it into overdrive, and carries me through the rest of my day. its exhausting... lets say a car has some kind of backup in it that kicks in when something breaks down, and it allows you to make it to where you need to go, but the cost is it uses up 5x the amount of gas. thats basically me, and ive been running on empty for years.    im a part-timer, with inconsistent hours, trying to pay for rent, trying to feed myself, trying to find things i can enjoy, dreaming and wishing id win enough money to relax, feeling dumber by the day, and getting so close to my breaking point... my friends keep asking me ""whats wrong,"" because apparently i ""seem off,"" but i must seem off every day. at this point, youd think theyd just be like ""oh, hes just a very sad, closed-off person!"" but no... something has to be wrong.    i never really had goals. if i did set something to reach for, i would just second guess myself, and feel stupid for it. i guess i have dreams though. unrealistic, borderline impossible, pointless dreams... but there are some normal ones. i wanted to be a cop, i wanted to be a firefighter, i wanted to be a chef, i mean... shit, at one point, i was like ""i could settle for a security job."" ... but i havent even tried. im afraid to try. ive been knocked down so much by others, that its hard to just stay up to keep myself alive.  i just want to be comfortable.  i just want to be happy.  i just want to feel okay.  i just want all of this to stop.  ""im selfish, because i only think of myself, and how i want to be better... so many others are in situations far worse than mine. im a terrible person for thinking i deserve better."" - that type of shit runs through my head every time i think about wanting to talk to someone.  im not okay. im not happy. im sorry. ive done nothing with my life, and will continue to do nothing...  i cant find someone to keep me company and help me out, because im not fit in the head to get into a relationship. i have a hard time just keeping friends anymore... yet i complain about being alone. fucking pathetic.    theres nothing i can do anymore, and people that try to help just get hurt. im a lost cause. i dont know why i try anymore.",2019-01-10 06:25:26,Ganondalf8,0
9npdlt,i don't feel like it's worth trying anymore,depression,"  it took me weeks to finally type this out. i just couldnt bring myself to type it out, for some reason...    im 22, and ive been fighting depression since i was probably about 7 or 8. it was never diagnosed as that back then, but i know now. it was caused by constantly being abused in almost every way i could be, by a step-father. that went on until i was 12, then my mother took that role after the divorce left her in a terrible state of stress. all of those events have passed, sure, and i am living in a pleasantly different situation now, with far less abuse, but the lasting effects have been holding me down for years and years, and it just gets worse and worse, evolving into a mess of terrible thoughts and actions that just feed my poor mental state, and constantly force myself to believe that everything is my own fault...    i feel like nothing i do is worth the effort, because i either dont do it perfectly, or i take too long in doing it, that i end up ""wasting time"". i try very hard to appeal to everyone, especially my superiors at work. i dont want to get fired. its my first job, and i like a lot of the people there... what i really want is a job that id be great at, and would be fine doing for most of my life, but i dont have passion, motivation, or any idea on what i might want to do even as a hobby. when i think about it, sometimes my brain says ""why not a chef?"" and then another part of me says ""thats dumb, and really hard to get into.""     this constant battle with myself is just so tiring... i cant seem to find happiness anymore, and dont know where to find it again. i feel like everything i do is pointless, and i cant even see myself making it to an old age. my depression and anxiety are holding me back so much, and i dont have the strength to fight back anymore... i just want to be happy and comfortable, but instead, im alone, uncomfortable, afraid, and lost. therapy hardly even helps anymore, and ive tried it many times. i just feel like a lost cause, a burden, a waste of space, and a waste of time.",2018-10-13 02:47:48,Ganondalf8,1

(i just remember this, but one time she scolded me for being happy and for laughing and said that that wasnt fair to her because she was alone)how can i leave it knowing that she is still suffering and probably will continue to suffer since shes religious and isnt educated about medication or the illness in general. i doubt that she even knows shes depressed. should i just try to find my own happiness and ignore her negativity? i literally came to my computer to write this after i went to the bathroom and had a tiny conversation with her. her eyes were red and watery, presumably from crying, and she told me to get closer. i guess she wanted to talk about something that is sad or is bothering her, but i have 0 fucking clue what is is, so i just said no and left. lmfao my life is a joke.

9j24v0,just not depressed anymore or hypomanic symptoms?,mentalhealth,"hello everybody,i apologize if this is somewhat of a “vanilla” question but i feel my mental health is at stake. i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder at the age of 18. i am now a 24 yo male. the periods usually range from 2-8 months of pure misery and suicidal ideation. i was hospitalized at an inpatient facility the july before last for these symptoms. just last week, i had what one may consider a suicide “attempt.” had the slipknot around my neck, note written, drunk enough for disinhibition, etc. was fading fast and around 5 secs away from passing out and asphyxiating myself. however, i felt an almost other-worldly presence crying out to me from in my body...almost like i was killing another pseudo-divine being inside me. like my body itself was crying out to spare it. so i did. this is where it gets tricky. my gp had started me on 5 mg of a newer ssri called trintellix about 3 days prior to this attempt. i was on no other medications up until that point (have been on others in the past, but weaned off 6 months prior). i am aware ssris can induce manic/hypomanic states and i fear this may be the case. from last week until now, it’s been almost a complete 180. i feel almost hyper-competent now. very motivated and have begun a strict diet and exercise regime. gotten more done in a week than the past 6 months. listening to music “speaks” to me again. i get chills up the spine and the back of my head from many songs, and just from thinking about profound thoughts about my life in general up until this point and how far i’ve come (i never get this neurochemical release when depressed). other changes in behavior: i’m much more open and talkative with people. i almost always feel like i can say the right thing. i am somewhat irritable and combative (really conscious to try to limit this). i can only sleep 5-6 hours a night, and it doesn’t feel very restful. still not tired during the day though. i have spent more money recently, but it’s on things to improve my health (new gym membership, new shoes for b-ball league, b-ball league fees, healthy food). i wasn’t really able to leave the house before up until this point. here’s the real kicker: i’ve displayed this behavior pattern before, back about 3 years ago in college. i believe it was also brought upon by the onset of a drug, this one an snri called bupuprion. much more irritable back then, to the point of outward physical aggression. i alienated a lot of good friends in this state with my behavior. some still won’t talk to me to this day. they used to say things like “you’ve changed.” but i ignored them until my parents kind of snapped me out of it. somewhat heavy amphetamine (adderall) use at this time. caffeine as well.fast-forward back to now, and i fear i may be in the same state. my stream of thoughts comes very fast, but not to the point of incomprehension or delusion. i’m really just afraid, guys. i have so many questions:has my medication induced a hypomanic state? has the trintellix even gotten enough time to take any sort of effect? is the sleep deprivation just my circadian rhythm readjusting to my sleep schedule (been trying to go to bed earlier). do any of these symptoms sound pathological in nature, or am i just being paranoid? is this just what it feels like to not feel depressed? i should add i am on no stimulants as i was afraid of going through that college thing again. and sorry for the long post: i’ve never relayed all of this information to someone at once before. i fear i may have been misdiagnosed; i’ve bounced around to so many mental health professionals that nobody has a comprehensive history of my behavior and mood patterns. tl;dr: have cyclical patterns that alternate between intense depression and more brief periods of “hyperactivity” and heightened states of well-being. not sure who i really am, or what my mental diagnosis should be. i’m really just trying to find the right medication for my condition (or lack thereof). i want to be a good person and not kill myself. i also fear another impending crash in mood from my current condition (depression always comes back for one reason or another). thank you for reading all or some of this post. i can clarify any info if need be.",2018-09-26 15:41:36,exactlyimprecise,1

abjsve,how do i get help,Anxiety,2018 became the year when anxiety and depression took over my life. i’m not officially diagnosed but i spend most days either sad or stressed or worried. i’ve had several panic attack-esque episodes and often feel a sense of impending doom. i feel miserable a majority of the time.i mostly have been telling myself it might be because it’s my first year with a career and the first year of me living in a city by myself. but it’s getting so overwhelming and my thoughts keep getting darker.i want help. i do. but i also really don’t want help. i hate the idea of seeing a counselor or therapist. i want to explore meds but am afraid of possible side affects or altering my brain state. i also keep telling myself that i had a healthy mind for years so i should be able to revert back. so really my question is: how do you go about asking for help or what options should i be pursuing? i feel lost and like there are no solutions. ,2019-01-01 19:12:30,MusicalMal,1
aed9e6,accepting needing medication again after years off of it. vent.,depression,"ive (23f) always hated that my body was incapable of keeping me balanced and happy. when i was 17, i was on zoloft for a few months and it help. the side effects were a lot to deal with though. sleep paralysis, appetite, etc. what helped is i picked up a few hobbies that i never had the motivation to keep up with otherwise. when i stopped taking it, over time, i kept up with them for years and stayed okay. id have episodes every now and then, but i was generally okay. this past year has been the best year of my life. i moved in with my soulmate. i have the happiest and healthiest relationship you could imagine. i laugh often, and he never fails to make me smile. but the last few months i had to quit my job because my boss was a homophobic, racist asshole and it made my anxiety, which had been next to none, escalate to insane levels of panic attacks to the point of throwing up. now, im struggling finding a new job. my best friend is moving 2000 miles away. my nightmares are back, my anxiety is worse than its ever been, and my depression has reach new levels.i refer to my depression episodes as being a passenger.. im not actually in my body as much as im just watching someone else live in my vessel. ive sat in our room, without moving or engaging in anything for hours at a time. i cant find the motivation to shower, or eat, or take part in any of my hobbies or interactions with my friends. im constantly breaking down into fits of profusely crying and feeling like i have someone sitting on my chest. ive spoken with my boyfriend and my parents. weve all agreed it would be best to go back on them and try prozac. and once i made the decision, which im fine with, my mind immediately sent me into a panic attack. ive been on edge, jumping at loud noises, not sleeping, and living as a passenger for two weeks now. im terrified. im absolutely terrified ill be trapped as a passenger, this half alive person, and now me. that it will numb me and keep me as a passenger, just not feeling anything. i dont know where else to post and dont want to worry anyone, im not suicidal, but god im so scared and dont want to live like this anymore. i have to accept that i do have manic depressive episodes and need this medication. but i wish i didnt need it to be human. i want to be human on my own. i want to be strong and conquer this on my own and no matter how hard i try, i cant. thanks for letting me vent, and thank you for caring if you made it this far. tldr: vent, i was doing so well off of my medicine for 5 1/2 years. now its worse than ever and i have to get back on them. and im not scared ill just be lifeless and numb.

ae8xth,no one can tell i'm depressed-and i keep it that way,depression,"this is my first post in the depression and im not sure why im posting. i guess i just need to get it off my chest. i think im depressed. i say i think cause ive never been diagnosed or sought treatment for depression in particular. im 22 now but ive been dealing with body image issues since i was 11 and the bulimia from sophomore year of high school. that was around the same time i started self harming. but no one could tell-i made sure to hurt myself in places covered by clothes and i still kept the same cheery demeanor i did everyday. i had good grades, a small but stable group of friends,  sports, played in the marching band. never went to a party. the ideal, boring high school student. my family had some issues, mainly between my brother and my dad, but i tried to stay out of it and be the dutiful daughter. doing chores, watching my siblings, listening to my parents. the self harming curbed as i was about to go to college but my eating disorder got worse. got to college and my first 2 years were pretty rough academically. skated by on natural talent in high school and realized that doesnt fly in university. ignored my grades and just tried to socialize as much as possible and started restricting my diet like crazy and working out for at least 2 hours a day just to feel in control. dropped to 105lb (im 54). was diagnosed with adhd my junior year much to the dismay of my parents-i was supposed to be the golden child. my brother was the trouble kid with the depression, anger issues, and adhd. just got medicated never went to therapy. junior year i was in a relationship. felt like i was soaring, continued to do mediocre in my classes and when i began to crash, i tried to turn to my then boyfriend for support but turns out he would rather go out to the bar and talk to other people. we broke up at the end of the year. depended on him so much i lost touch with a lot of friends and opportunities. during that time i didnt take my adhd meds regularly. just made me feel like shit that i had to take them in the first place. senior year my stress, depression, and anxiety was even worse. felt suicidal. was vomiting everyday and my grades were plummeting. felt like i was an idiot for picking a major as difficult as computer science when i wasnt applying myself like i should. tried a couple therapy sessions at the end of the year and tried to talk to my mom about sitting in on a session over the phone and she screamed at me about how i was faking/overreacting. dropped to 94lb around this time. i was also about to take my 5th year cause i had planned my classes so horribly and also wanted to improve my gpa. i think i wouldve really hurt myself seriously if my current boyfriend wasnt there to just keep me company and be positive. still, i never told him fully what was going on. now hes in california and im on the east coast and were doing a long distance thing and hes still amazing. so loving and kind and ive let him know to a small extent my feelings of depression and i made it seem like i used to have an eating disorder though i still have episodes to this day. but things at home are getting worse and my mom and dad are fighting, my brother (20, has pretty mentally abusive tendencies stemming from anger and depression) is making things harder on my mom and i can see her starting to crack. my little sister (11) cries in secret after their fights and im the one who tries to comfort her when shes trying to get away. im at home now for winter break and im so stressed about home life once i leave and my mom has no one to help her cook, clean, or listen to her. also been stressed this past month because last semester, right before finals i fainted twice in 3 days and got concussed. felt silly the first time i fainted (during an exam) and tried to brush it off and just made a couple appointments to check myself out the next week. fainted 2 days later, hit my head harder. concussed. still have headaches and my mood has been even lower but i still have to study. yet, im still trying to be supportive and happy for my mom. trying to help around the house while studying for the exams i couldnt take. trying to build a better relationship with my brother and help him even when he hurls abuse at me, not that thats always. trying and trying but not feeling like im making any progress. feel like im a failure. ive always ""joked"" for the last few years i wasnt gonna make it past 30 cause of stress and the fact i get sick all the time. been saying that a little more often and my boyfriends picking up on it and hes starting to get concerned but now im doing my best to cover it up. last night, he called me and i joked i wanted to die. but for a bit i didnt know if i was joking. i wasnt even sad anymore. just reached a point where i didnt feel anything and just thought of how i could kill myself-obviously didnt act on it. just told my boyfriend i didnt much want to talk about what was going on and went to sleep. i dont know if this is dissociation but i can imagine myself being gone without feeling much right now. and at the moment that doesnt even scare me. just wanted to get that off my chest. &#x200b;tldr; i look happy, successful, healthy, and smart but im dealing with an eating disorder, family issues, post concussion syndrome, academic struggles, and what i think is depression. been covering it up very well my whole life. starting to imagine taking my own life. doesnt even make me sad anymore-dont know if im starting to dissociate because ive never felt this way before. dont know why im sharing except to see if others have had the same experience.

aebrvs,"does anyone else hate those stupid self help posts about ""getting out and living your life to the fullest""?",depression,"its not that i dont want to do more with my life. i would love to be anywhere other than here, out doing things i enjoy, making friends, traveling the world, and working at a job that doesnt make me hate my life like all those stupid self help websites say is the key to curing depression. but thats not how the world works. the set of circumstances i wound up in have basically made this far too difficult.i can rarely afford to do anything because my job pays me in literal pocket change (i get payed only in tips), and my attempts to get a better paying job (much less a job i enjoy) in this shithole of a city has been fruitless. id go to collage and get a higher education, but even that is insanely difficult, because my gpa is terrible, i cant afford it even with scholarships (and im not using loans, id be in debt till i died), and the mere thought of having to go back to school again, given how horrid my grade school experience was, give me no amount of revulsion. but i need to go to some type of higher learning school, as its the only way to get a skill set needed to get an even remotely well paying job, and make actual friends my age. i dont want to, and i dont even know how i could, but its my only way out, and even then it seems too far out of reach.and i cant drive, and learning how is proving difficult because of my anxiety and lack of multitasking skills. i can get in a car and drive it from point a to b on an empty stretch of road no problem, but the moment i get on a highway or city road it becomes far too stressful. having to deal with other drivers, the speed limit, the various road rules, and my impatient asshole of a dad in the passengers seat yelling orders at me is insanely nerve wracking. id ask somebody else to take me places, but my family members hate going anywhere they need to be unless its important, so i only get to go out if somebody else is, and i cant use uber or some kind of public transit, but we live a ways outside town so uber doesnt pick up here and the lawmakers where i live (southern usa) seem to view public transportation as this strange foreign concept they cant properly comprehend. not like i could afford it with my income anyway.im trapped on this metaphorical island with now way off because i cant sail a boat through rough seas.it wouldnt even be so bad if the internet here wasnt fucking horrible. i used to play games online a lot and i had a bunch of online friends, now i can barely use a web browser. it gets worse and worse by the month no matter what we do, and no matter how many times the isp sends a repair guy out. and they absolutely refuse to upgrade us to a faster service despite our neighbors having (slightly) better internet packages. i even made an fcc complaint to try and solve the issues, but not only did our isp not fix anything, i think they intentionally made it worse out of spite.that is why im depressed, its not that i dont want to be out doing things or enjoying my life, ""living life to the fullest"", i just cant. im either stuck here doing fuck all or doing yard work because my dad cant be bothered to do it himself, or im stuck at my shitty job that i cant quit yet because my parents wont let me unless i have another lined up.if it wasnt for my crippling existential fear of death, i probably wouldve offed myself already, and even that is starting to lose effectiveness. i dont want to die, nor do i wish i was never born, i just wish my life was better, that things just went my way for a change, and i could actually enjoy myself for once. id go seek mental help, but ive lost my health due to turning 21 (military dependant) and now i cant afford insurance or any medical care for that matter. ive been trying to find a better job so i can move out and get healthcare, but the only jobs that have been willing to hire are basically minimum wage slave labor with no benefits. ive even been trying to use my disability, aspergers syndrome, to help find jobs and benefits, but even that has proved fruitless. most job sites about aspergers/autism just inform companies on resources for hiring people with asd, but dont actually provide a resource for asd people. the only site i found that was a job resource for people with asd had zero jobs in my area.at this point, i just want to give up. my life feels like ive endured tons of shit for very little in return. i feel trapped, but im too cowardly for even the cowards way out",2019-01-09 23:46:09,Sir_Maxwell_378,1

ae6yep,missed my first therapy appointment,depression,"hi guys! i have been following this this sub alot and before going into what i have been going through i wanted to tell everyone how special and unique they are. and you are so worth it. a while back i was diagnosed with severe depression and disordered eating ( anorexia kind of ). in october i admitted myself to an emergency room in my city because i didn’t want to live anymore. i was feeling like everything i did was worthless, that i was not good looking, overweight even though i am a 21 year old girl, 5’5 106 pounds. i had no job or education and felt like a total failure. i still feel like this at this day but, still need help. i am seeing a therapist who is great, since that time in october and have been making steps to finish my classes and get a job. but i wanted to do behavioural cognitive therapy first, my therapist referred me. my first meeting was this morning. and i flaked. so hard. i couldn’t sleep, i have this huge migraine because i kept clenching my jaw, and there is a huge snow storm outside. it seems like a good enough reason to not go right. but i still feel like i am making up excuses to not go or do anything. i used to think that i had to go out at least once a day, even if its just going to the grocery store. it was important to go out. even just a little. i havent got out of my house in a while except a couple of days ago for a meeting i had with my guidance counsellor. i have to go out and buy my medication but cant even find that motivation. is it too cold? do i hate winter? am i tired? or am i depressed and just lazy. feels like the last one constantly. it feels like i only find excuses. one part of me says it is okay and the other one shames me for being at home all day. even though i do chores for 4-6 hours a day, try and workout a little in my living room, put makeup on, i even paint even though i am so bad lol . i try to do things that i like. but it always feels like it is not enough and im lazy and i feel that everyone thinks that i am even my boyfriend. i don’t know if i want to go to this therapy center i was talking about earlier, got off track a bit. it is very far away, like 1 hour to go by bus and i do not have a car. i try my best for real and i am just getting sadder and even more scared because i am scared i will never accomplish anything, and i will be like this forever. i desperately want to get better. i would do anything but at the same time i feel like nothing is going to solve this. sorry for this huge rant people. i hope you have a wonderful day.

9wn3l3,the consequences of your past will always effect your future no matter how turned around you become. good or bad.,offmychest,"it doesn’t matter how cleaned up you get or how well you’re doing, when you’ve burnt most of the bridges you’ve ever built, intentionally or not, it can get lonely and sometimes you can never go back.  someone once told me “if you’re lonely when you’re alone you’re in bad company.” there’s been no quote i’ve held closer to my heart than that one. i’ve hurt a lot of people on many different levels. i had no idea who i was a year ago. i’ve spent the last year, i hate this term, soul searching. and i’m happy to say i found it. i know who i am. i know what i’ve done. i’ve done all i can to show everyone who ever doubted me and more importantly myself that i’m not a piece of shit and i am a good person, regardless of my behaviors and actions in the past. the best part is that progression should be continuous and i never want to stop. i haven’t spoken to my dad in 5 months. i intentionally cut him out of my life for so many reasons i could fill a book. my life would be very different had he passed instead of my mom. i don’t blame him for any mistake i’ve made, but i have solid reasons to leave him behind. unfortunately, my siblings and nephews have turned against me. i can’t say i blame them seeing as they all live off my dad, but hey, there always must be a family villain. truthfully, i have a few people in my life that have faith in me and love me. if it weren’t for them, i have no idea how much further i could have dug the grave i crawled out of without dying. they helped me get through my divorce and drug addiction. the divorce finalized on the 2nd and i’m almost 90 days clean from addictions i never ever thought i would give myself. for them i am eternally grateful. rigorous exercise and my militant routine combat depression better than any drug or codependency ever could. that’s the best advice i could give any kid suffering from mental illness. the biggest part of me wants to tell someone that they were right. to tell them thank you and how sorry i am that they had to suffer for me to get to where i am. if i could have done it differently, i would have. i know the damage, the scarring and the nightmares i’ve caused. there’s nothing i can do to make it better and i’ll always think about it. they were right. i wore out my welcome back home so i left. you can call it running away or starting over. maybe it’s both. the fact is, i’m happy. i’m ok because i get to hang out with myself every day. i actually love myself. i hated people telling me i needed to do that. i never knew how. it just happened one day. it just clicked on after non stop self improvement. i can recall the exact moment. i’m forming new, healthy relationships, because i know how to now, and life is what i’d always wanted it to be. i just needed to be in control and i never was. things don’t suck anymore, i just needed to get these feelings off my chest. hopefully this was the place to do it. thanks.

ae551a,"i’m depressed. i know i will live through so many happy moments, but i still can’t escape suicidal thoughts",depression,"hello. just to start this off, i’m not currently in any danger, and when i say i feel suicidal, it’s more of a general feeling opposed to a crisis situation, if that makes sense. anyhow. as i’ve gotten older, i’ve realized how truly toxic my mother is. she is a victim of abuse, and has had many difficulties in her life that make being a kind, centered person difficult. but it’s like she doesn’t make the actual effort, she has a ficade of therapy effort - making endless lists about how to appreciate things more and how to be kinder - but never actually following through or trying to stay centered. i am depressed myself, and i understand how difficult it can be, but sometimes it feels like she’s given up any effort and it negatively effects those closest to her (me, her husband).to put it very mildly and in fewer words, my childhood wasn’t great. i’ve grown to be a little closed off, but it seems like more so now for some reason i feel very disconnected from other people, the concept of family, familial love. commercials with families make me roll my eyes and cringe, people with children make me feel gross, children in general make new little uncomfortable, when people talk about culture or heritage it makes me want to about puke. i don’t know if i’m more realistic, or a product of how i was raised, but i feel alone in the world. i know i can make friends, and i can make family from friends, and i can love myself and my hobbies, but... knowing that i don’t have a normal family to support me is making me sad. but it feels like i don’t even want to feel that way because i think family is stupid and bad. knowing i will never be able to have a normal wedding, knowing that i will feel guilt for not working harder to bond with my mom, feeling like every family gathering or party is torture (my own small family or otherwise), feeling almost like an orphan. i feel like i want to be able to have a family to love me and who i can go “look at what i did” or “i need motherly support”. i can’t imagine this with my real parents, but just quasi fake parents that aren’t the ones i have. all of that family build up leading to, i truly feel alone in the world. that gut feeling, where your just i your room and you’re half aware and there’s pressure ringing in your ears. i don’t see the point of living life sometimes, if i am to have such a lonely existence with no one i can fall back on, or trust, or talk to, or just feel comfortable around or feel happy to see. this general lonely feeling and a bit of a drift in my direction in my life after i was thrown of course have culminated in me thinking about offing myself or just stepping on the train tracks. i won’t, because i’m truly a coward, and thinking about suicide is a lot easier than doing it, like, ow man. i would feel guilty for the train operator and whoever sold me the gun, i wouldn’t want them to feel bad. anyhow. i am mindful, and aware of my depression, and how to deal with it well and properly, i’m managing myself, but even still... it feels bad, man. i just don’t have anyone i feel like are my people that i can be myself around just cuz we’re related. honestly, that almost sounds foreign to me and i get weirded out by families that are close. but i can’t tell if i’m the weird one? or out of touch, perhaps. i don’t know what to do with this feeling - drawing, reading, distraction helps, but it creeps back and weighs me down. i can’t mindful myself out of it. all of that, combined with global warming, politics, corruption... i feel as if there is a lot of practical weight both personal and worldly that are getting me down beyond a point that i can truly remedy, because some stuff is just extra sucky. i know it can’t always be sucky... but when it sucks, it **sucks**. but after all that, i realized, writing that down helped a little. i’m still stuck here, floating in gelatin, but at least i can do things to feel 2% better. thanks for coming to my gad talk.

8mkfuo,i got a letter from my past self,depression,"last year in junior year, my english class made us write letters to ourselves in the future, to our senior selves. they would be mailed out after college acceptances and near graduation, and i receieved mine today.i was severely depressed. the letter i had written was short but...sad. i had written to my future self to go back to counseling and therapy because i was really struggling back then. i wrote a lot of hateful words about myself, and apologized so many times, just for being that way. past!me had written that she knew things in the future might not be as great, but maybe they’ll be better. i don’t think she even knew if i’d live to read the letter. but i did. and she’s right, things aren’t great but i just got back into therapy a week ago, and i made it a goal to go regularly. i actually got into a college for a major i wanted, and i’m getting paid regularly(even though it’s little) from a part time job. i’m not going great, i’m not...not extremely depressed anymore but i think, i can say i’m at a different place than i was a year ago. i think past!me would be proud of who i am now, at least for having better handwriting and going back to therapy.if i was asked if i had grown without getting the chance to read that letter, i would’ve laughed and said, “absolutely not. i’m still as messed up as before.” but even if it’s very little, i can see from the letter that i have grown. i am different. i think it’s very hard to notice growth because of my depression, but with a physical comparison i can see it clearer. and i’m thankful in a way because i was so depressed then, but now a year later i can see i’ve grown just a little from that bad place. and so maybe in another year, i’ll be at an even different place, and i can be assured that no, even if it feels like i’m in the same place, i really am not.tldr: my school mailed a letter i had written to my future self and it gave me a chance to see that i’ve grown, even though i had felt like i hadn’t. it gave me a little hope. that i’ll live another year. sorry it’s so long.",2018-05-27 23:20:18,joonie10132017,1

8k5grg,i don't feel comfortable telling my primary care doctor about my mental illness but i need to in order to get medication,depression,"recently my mother was sent to the emergency room and she suddenly had the realization that my depression and anxiety was absolutely not normal, and i should maybe see a doctor.however the problem now is that we share a primary care doctor, and the doctors office all speaks our language and is familiar with my family. were a small asian community, so everyone knows everyone and people definitely gossip and even though i know theres patient doctor confidentiality, i feel really uncomfortable disclosing my mental illness to the family doctor. it feels like confessing all my sins to a pastor who has dinner with my family every week, it feels too close to home.i also feel like i might be judged. mental illness is already a stigma, my parents already dont understand it beyond, ""that persons crazy"" and family life is responsible for a large part of my anxiety and depression. but i dont need them to know that, and i think itll reflect badly on my parents if the doctors hear how stressed i am because of them. it sounds stupid and i would tell the opposite to anyone who tells me this, but i feel like ill be pitied or seen as weak if i disclose to the family doctor, and i dont want that to spread in the community. right now, i go to youth center on and off for counseling sessions thats very far from my house. my mom knows and doesnt necessarily approve but i still go because its all i have. but ive been depressed for around 5 years, and counseling, meditating, journaling, all these things that couldve helped me cope without the need for medication have not. in fact, i feel like im stuck and even worse than i was last year when i thought, ""with time ill be okay!"" so i feel like i should start considering medication, im just not sure if it should be with my primary care doctor. is there any way for me to get medication from them without explicit stating all the details of my mental illness? should i just ignore all my fears about the gossip and just go through with it and tell them?",2018-05-17 19:13:28,joonie10132017,1

ae3vo0,my wits' end rant.,depression,"first off, i should say that this will probably seem like random thoughts strung together with barely any kind of cohesiveness.okay, i am a 36 year old guy that has been dealing, or suffering from, depression and anxiety for about a decade now. during this whole time i have been living with my mother. since moving in, one of my brothers has moved in as well. im not going to go into very many details about him other than he is older than me and has three kids he gets visitation with every other week. meaning the kids stay here as well. oh, and i will add that i absolutely despise him.anyway, weve been living like this, the three of us plus occasionally three children, for 8 years.in the beginning of all of this, when i first moved in with my mother, i was down or sad, but i didnt let it get to me as much. since we moved and my brother moved in as well, i have been getting down a lot more often, or have anxiety attacks at random it seems. some of it i know is my mind giving me reasons for such things to happen, but the rest i believe is because of the family i live with. i often joke about how this place is a black hole that sucks away any joy i may obtain. but its really not that far from the truth. every time i do actually feel good, or like everything will be alright, its usually because im somewhere else for an extended period of time. then, like always, i come back home and all of that joy is sucked down into the joyless black hole. of course, the reasonable thing to do is for me to move out. but i have not worked in three years due to my issues. before that id barely work. some jobs here and there, but id usually quit due to the same issues that keep me from trying to work at all. if i do get a job id need to save like crazy, but i already know the leaches that i love with will constantly bug me for money. not that im saying i shouldnt help out around the house at all, but they would drain me of every penny. not to mention my bad spending habits. so, basically what i am saying is that i need to get out of this house. i do not have anywhere else to go, dont have a job, and i cant ever seem to get myself to even try to get one. if i cant do any of this, i dont know how much more i can allow myself to take. any advice would be greatly appreciated. and i do mean more than the standard get a job and get out stuff i hear from everyone already.

(i am still able to make myself game with them some. i stopped for a long time but i realized i needed to at least reconnect with them since it would be good for me and had no negatives plus i missed them.)this is truly like being in some unending nightmare, realizing where you are, and then not being able to remember when you got here, or fathom how you will leave it. as one of the few people who believe that literally no one deserves to suffer, i will also say that regardless who you are(literally) you person reading this dont deserve to suffer so much and if you havent realized that i hope you do. and i hope things improve some for you if they are bad. id make a throwaway but i am the not-really-functioning-at-all-depression type so i have lost everything i am capabale of losing basically anyway.*hr claims they believed that i wanted to quit, and what i said could reasonably probably be seen that way so its not like i can win a law suit or risk filing.

85zuxj,my depression story,depression,"i used to take depression as a joke when i was a little ignorant kid, but over the past 2 years i’ve experienced the real degrading symptoms that one can experience being depressed. its gotten worse and worse, but now i think i’m starting to improve. here are some reasons why my mental state has degraded. 1. so sophomore year i started dating this beautiful, kind, and caring girl that just wanted to be my best friend and love me and do stuff with me. one night for some cruel, arrogant, selfish reason my plastered-drunk self decided that losing my virginity was more important than her. but it wasn’t only the heinous act of cheating on her is what made me hate myself. she found out and then forgave me. this amazing girl that showed me unconditional love just forgave me and still wanted to be with me. i was elated and we decided that we were both just going to put this situation behind us, but the stain was permanent. we kept dating for two more months and were kind of happy but it didn’t last. she was not happy and she would cry regularly and so would i. i tried my best to fix our relationship and make her happy again, but she said that she could never really get over what i did to her and who can blame her? i was the complete source of her unhappiness so i set her free and told her to leave me. we were still friends and regularly talked and i could see her start to blossom again like she was when we first met, but i can still never get over the guilt of cheating on her, then giving her the burden of forgiving me and staying with me in an unhappy relationship. i feel like i have this stain of manipulation in my character that to me just destroys my self worth. i feel like i just completely let her down because kind and loving people like her don’t deserve that ever and i feel as though i will never truly be able to show her how deeply sorry i am and how much i still care about her. like its already too late. im not asking to be forgiven nor do i want to be, i just want to move on from it, but i can’t seem to shake this sticking guilt.2. i’ve always felt like i’m a hindrance on people that work with and interact with. i’m a slow learner and always have been, but it seems that whenever i work with people theres this vibe of frustration with me and it makes me feel like i’m stupid and can’t do anything right. i feel that every time at work and at school 3. i love my brother with all my heart and i’m pretty sure we are each others’ best friend, but i feel a sort of resentment towards him and feel guilty about it. my brother is a few years older than me so naturally he was stronger than i was. he bullied me a lot growing up. he would constantly call me really hurtful things on an almost daily basis and would punch me on a daily basis too. i could never walk past him in the house without being hurt or berated by him in some way. it seemed like i always had a bruise from him to always remind me that he didn’t see me as his brother, but as as more weight on his shoulders. i know some may read this and think “well thats just what older brothers do,” but growing up i all i wanted from him was to be his friend and do stuff brother stuff with him, but he would constantly knock me down and push me away. we are best friends now that he is grown up and is in college, but i sometimes have a hard time believing he is genuinely sorry for how he treated me growing up. and i feel guilty because maybe he feels i was too clingy towards him and maybe i deserved it. in 2016 through early 2017 i felt mainly sad and drained and stupid, but late 2017 to today i’ve started having suicidal thoughts. i thought about how and where i would kill myself, what my suicide note would say and how or if my friends and family would grieve for me. i don’t think i have a real desire to commit suicide, but sometimes i think that maybe dying will defeat my demons.  i don’t want to believe this and i have been improving and getting less and less of these thoughts through the week, but it can be really hard to keep those thoughts out of my head sometimes. i truly believe that talking about this and getting these problems off my chest does make me feel better and thats why i’m writing this. if you have any advice on how to cope with this or if you have a story you would like to share with me i will greatly appreciate it. if you sense that maybe someone is going through depression please reach out to them and make yourself someone that can be there for them. even if they are just having a temporary low point, it can really mean the world knowing that someone out there cares about them and wants to seen them thrive.thank you for hearing me.",2018-03-21 07:58:30,NIAD_SIRDNE,1

adz652,instagram’s new feature makes me more depressed...,depression,"so apparently not being content with being “facebook for kids”, instagram is continuing its desire to become “facebook for kids (with features from snapchat). basically there’s this new feature called “close friends”, where your able to make these stories that only people you approve of can see when they’re a part of this snapchat-esque friend rating. i think that this is being implemented to stop people from creating “finstas”. accounts that people use for like a year or two and then create another one are probably annoying and take up lots of server space. so instead of creating a more personal account, you can post what i think are temporary and only the people you want to know will see these pictures. however, i think this is a pretty shortsighted solution, and it’s only going to make actual problems on instagram worse.it seems ironic to me that the website that’s been proven via survey to be the worst social media service for teens and young adults is basically adding a social hierarchy system to their app. what good is this feature going to do? all that’s going to happen is people will feel worthless or depressed when they say that they’re not somebody’s “close friend”. instead of having a reason to make a second account for your friends or whatever, instagram just wants to give you the ability to tell people to screw off. and it runs both ways too.people who utilize this feature are going to become stressed because they already have followers and stuff, and now they have to manage a close friends list to make sure people aren’t excluded or drop people from it that they want to blow off, just creating a more passive aggressive statement. so great job making people feel even more stressed. not to mention how instagram is also commonly linked to body shaming and other forms of bullying. that’s not going to get any better with a list of people you can exclude them from. stop trying to pepper in bits of stressful snapchat.#fuckinstagram",2019-01-08 23:28:36,Jack-sama15,1

""well, if its early enough, im paying the mob. if not, im buying some legs."" i try being an activist for my cause with things like a documentary--no updates in a year from the filmmakers. my friend has her reality show in the top 25 shows on cable, in its 3rd season. i have to compare myself to others, as doing so is not an option, as it fuels my thirst for knowledge.my dreams of finding a nice guy, even if it doesnt work out, well thats fading. high school folks, even if doesnt work, are getting engaged. dont want that yet, but want to at least be on the market, which good luck with how low my voice sounds and the fact i cant conceive. never could carry because of medical stuff. so ill grow old and die alone. friends will have moved on. ill be in a group home. goals unmet, be it just on a game show, living alone or just anything normal someone my age would do.i cant even have a job i dislike for 20 hours/week to work towards a hobby/dream job i want--making youtube videos at the arcade, just to help people win things, cheer up their day a little, give back to the world at large. been like this too long to see anyone else suffer, so i figured ages ago, if i cant help myself, why not help others? as my facebook cover photo says, weve given two hands: one to help ourselves, the other to help others. seems that former hand was cut off in my case, to be honest.the best part of my day is just talking or writing about sports, which is fun for me, i admit, but thats all ive got, and even then, that has its come and go phases for me. i just feel cursed by my own doing, which has made me a terrible person to everyone. just going on hoping some semblance of these dreams deferred, whithering like raisins in the sun, can bear some form of fruity, plump grapes.i want to succeed so much, much as i doubt myself. but because of personal matters, seems it wont happen. rarely do i blame the world around me, as this is of my own doing, volition. so many great ideas will pass. this life will have been for nothing once i go. nobody will have known or cared, although likely better without me. and, to be sure, at this point, why should they, much as id like to do otherwise? everything i do is midasian, except it turns to shit. try my best, but its not good enough. just dont know what i can do. got things planned out, but as usual, delayed beyond belief. couldnt i just have at least a normal life? i question my purpose daily, even beyond that of the philosophical. got one of the few good things left taken away, between that and my father...miss these things dearly.thanks for reading, and bless you kind soul for doing so. wish you an excellent time of your life, and may your days be joyous as the harmonies of joyous chorales.",2017-07-20 01:01:22,The_Running_Sloth,1

and thats where matters get complicated.i started hormones at age 20, which a lot of people say is young. not me! ive always known since i was two, and was denied hormones by rather uninformed doctors and therapist four years, most of my teen years, so i am still very bitter about never getting to experience high school as my true self. however, this was no fault of my family; they are extremely supportive of my transition and so forth, very much so, but im told that i look in-between by some of them, after like 2.5 years on hormones, which hurts a bit, though perhaps understandable due to cognitive biases. my hair doesnt grow out either, though it has been a touch recently. pretty much all people over five see me as female, but i think theyre just being nice, but its hard to tell at times. that, and four year old kids dont think im a girl, they think im just playing tricks on them, which is crushing. probably this voice, though they also say i dont look like one, which is the last thing i need. horrific, really...ive been told my voice sounds like jessica rabbit, but im not dumb enough to believe such nonsense. i also worry about my ability to get employed; i look at the fact that i applied for a few fast food places in the area, and they still wouldnt hire me, after an interview in which i discussed the entire company history, plus their menu, as to be best educated about the practices of the applicable corporation. if i cant get hired for this, no reason to think i can succeed in my desired major, finance, either. after all, my grades sunk the past three semesters after my father died completely unexpectedly, who i was really close withand thus, i live at home, with no friends in this state i can talk to. im told im a mooch, a leech, and that i need to get a life. this doesnt help things at all, and not really sure what i can do there. i want to be able to repay my family for all theyve done for me, and then some. so, the way i figured i would do that is get on wheel of fortune, since they were in my area, and its my webpages focus. disclosure: i love my game shows, pathetic a hobby as it is. a lot. i do really well at them, so it seems like it would be beneficial to get on. so, its january 2014, and im at the audition for wheel, where its 60 people; of those probably 6-8 will make the cut for the show. the number of people in the room is trimmed down to 21, and i am one. i never make a mistake, play really well, i get excited, heck, i am moreso for the other players, genuinely, than they were for themselves.many of my friends have been on like five game shows, and hey, i could help my own page on these matters, plus my family, right? so, we wait two weeks for a mailed letter (if it shows, youre in the pool)-mine doesnt come. of course, lots of my friends have made it on, so i feel inadequate again in my life, including a chorus director our family is pretty close with. was i happy for him? of course! i can always support other people when they get something good in their life; its about all ive got going for any kind of positive emotional state these days. my mental instabilities have always rooted from internal processing.mother claims its because, ""they can tell you were trans. thats 100 percent it."" didnt help they asked for my name as it exactly appeared on social security. i was screwed, since documentation wasnt officially changed until march of that year, but my appearance and common name were changed for about seven months at that point. then, she told me not to try out again because of what it did to me the first time. thanks for the words of encouragement! not like this is a life dream or anything, silly as it sounds.so, i let everyone down, from family, to my page, etc. they say otherwise, but thinking about what it could have done for all parties, i absolutely did. dont tell me i didnt. i could have given my site more information. i could have gotten to move the heck out of here. i could have paid some of my surgical expenses. told myself if i was just given one chance at this show, id make it. lets face it, its less about the show, as it is financial independence. im told all the time about how much happier ill be when i get a job/am out of the house, but not sure how much thats true, or even likely to happen.a rather peculiar ending disclosure here: im usually on the other end of things; i typically try to help save peoples lives, which is in part why im working with the documentarys media. i like to help people become themselves, even if its just with me, or how to do this on a larger scale. heck, i presented with my friend jazz jennings last year in front of hundreds to help encourage a similar message.im just a loser who surely is going to blow her potential, and be worth nothing, like so many others. sigh. thanks for reading all this, if you got this far, and sorry you wasted your time dealing with such an inane diatribe. just wish there were solutions out there for so many of these problems, but it doesnt seem possible. just dead ends.",2015-03-14 14:23:21,The_Running_Sloth,1

853wg2,i need advice on what to do with a depressed friend.,depression,"i have a friend that i got to know through uni, weve known each other for a year and a half. he is a very nice person, got good humor, and is generally a good friend. my problems with him lie within his mental problems. now, before anyone judges me, or thinks that im attacking people with mental illness; im not. i suffer from depression and anxiety myself. back to the issue: my friend had asperger syndrome, and has had depression the major part of his life. i also think he has some anxiety. * he has medication, but never takes them on the proper time. * every time we meet up, he is late (unless he cancels on me, which he does often). its not 5-10 minutes kind of late, its closer to 30-45 minutes late. it is very annoying to never have him show up on time. * his apartment is always in a big big mess. not a problem per se, but he always expects that you are gonna clean when you get there. (ex: he asks me if i could do dishes, vacuum etc. or ""if i do the dishes you can clean the living room). * he likes to play the victim a lot. he keeps giving examples to make me feel sorry for him. this sound harsh, but a lot of my friends feel that he is doing it for attention. i dont know what im gonna do. having depression and anxiety myself means i am almost always tired. and my friend almost always just expects that i will do stuff that he asks for (ex: clean his apartment, follow him to the hospital). im starting to feel like his mom, which is very **very** tiring. how can i explain to him that im getting tired of his ways without hurting him? and also while not being a douche bag. ive tried talking with him about him always being late, and him taking care of his apartment, all i get for an answer is : ""i know"". and then nothing happens. we as a friend group are close to having an intervention for him, because we all feel like he needs to change some how. im very open for a discussion, am i a bad friend who cant deal with his mental issues? advice are very much welcome.

71ilwg,feeling alone on my 25th birthday,depression,"this is mostly going to be me rambling and getting stuff off my chest. turned 25 today. id be lying if i said that it didnt bother me. kinda feeling the age crisis. thats not really the point tho. i just feel like theres a lot of things hitting me at once, and im in a slump right now. i usually get these slumps every now and then, and they last anything between a couple of days to almost a month. im in week 2 now. im back to feeling so cold and empty inside, that mixed with a sort of existential crisis. im failing uni classes, my living partner (not a bf) is away working a lot so im home alone, my apartment is a mess right now, im on my way to having no income, the love of my life will never be accepted by my parents, and my few friends live far away. its like i said earlier in my text, i feel like im cold all the time. like a chill that never goes away. the only places i dont feel cold in, are in a burning shower or under my blankets in bed. and thats just the problem...why would i go out into the cold, unforgiving world when i can just lie down in my safe space in bed? i try to do the bare minimum every day, make sure i have food in my fridge, make sure i eat at least 2 meals a day, do laundry when needed. but still i feel like i should be doing so much more, i feel like such a disappointment. my 2 siblings have gone through school and work just fine, and they are doing really well. and i dont hate them, i just feel like i am the disappointment in the family. ive tried medication, i was on sertraline for a while. id heard good stuff about it, like ""saving peoples lives"". well it didnt do me any good. it was a long process to getting the body used to medication, and my entire body went haywire. the nightmares were the worst. i would have more nightmares than ""normal"" dreams. when my body had finally adjusted, it didnt do much, i just felt i was in a haze all the time. i felt...nothing. not even positive emotions. so i quit. which means im just back in my normal routine. sometimes i feel good, sometimes im down in the slump...as i am right now. this isnt exactly an post asking for help or answers, i mostly wanted to write all of this down. maybe someone else here is feeling the same?

9m8dy3,rant about current situation,depression,"hello 2nd or 3rd time posting on here. this will be a long wall of text probably so im sorry for that, thus the early warning. last year at the end of november i went with my family to kansas for my grandpas birthday. i loathed the thought of leaving my friends house to go back to the job i worked myself to death at and my constantly bitching family. so i stayed for 3 months and was stuck in a shed with my best friend playing games and getting worse. i had no transportation and we were in a very tiny outlying town so i never got a job or made any dr appointments. i was about to pick up my friends glock and end my life when i messaged my mom on facebook and she had my one good brother come and get me to bring me home.after being back with my mom for a month and a half i still didnt have a job and didnt go to the dr. ended up getting into a big fight with my brother and sister who had their own appartments in the same building. they took my phone and took it outside and locked me out of my moms place. i called the cops to come pick me up and take me in for suicidal thoughts. they took me to a hospital an hour away and after 2 days they sent me to a very nice mental facility in yankton sd (highly recommend them).i was only there for a week and half before they released me and they ended up taking me off my antidepressant without giving me anything to replace it because they were afraid missing it a day would make me sick (sounded really fucking stupid to me. i went and stayed at my dads but quickly got sick of him because he doesnt understand me and he gets angry very fast. i saw a therapist twice while living with him but she didnt really say much or do anything. after a month of my dad i moved to another town with a friend i made at the facility.there i started seeing a doctor and a therapist and worked with the dept of labor, rehab servicies, ss, and an employment specialist. i was able to get foodstamps but only for 3 months after that i had to have proof of disability or a dr note saying i cannot work. i was very lethargic and couldnt do much before i was too tired to move. i went out with my specialist to do a work trial and passed out after 5 mins of cleaning. my friend soon got tired of me not having a job which was understandable because we both thought i would be able to work right away. once again i had to move back with my mother.saw a dr very soon after moving in and it was discovered that i had an extremely low functioning thyroid. a year prior to this blood test i had had my thyroid checked and they never contacted me with the results or informed the dr. that was right before i stayed in kansas. i was so low functioning it was an emergency for me to pick up the medacation. after a month  of being on it i felt really good was able to do things for longer and didnt feel so depressed. and then as luck would have it my mom had 5 grand come to her from her old jobs retirment fund. they had used the wrong paperwork years back and didnt give it all to her as she had requested. we used the money to move to another town with my brother and sister. but before we moved we owed over 1500 dollars to the land lord for past due rents. and the electricity had been behind 3 months for about a year. while this move was going on i was constantly treated like shit by my brother and sister who both lost their jobs 2 months before we moved. one day the verbal abuse was so bad i laid down in the living room and cried after they left.  i ended up walking to the clinic where my mother was crying most of the time. a friend of mine drove by and tried to talk to me but i broke down while trying to talk. now to current times weve lived in our new place for 2-3 weeks. the realty place that manages our property lied to us before we moved in they said they cleaned everything and fixed up the problems we had while viewing it. we got here the place was filty it had maybe been swept they painted over every window 4 outlets didnt and still dont work the living room light is non functioning as well we put lightbulbs in it and the flashed like crazy and died its a good thing none of us was epileptic. the basement came with a washer and drying but there was only 1 3 prong outlet for the washer. every other outlet in the basement and garage is from 1950 no lie and we cant use anything with them. the dryer is pluged in with a converter thingy into one of the old sockets. our stove electrecuted us when we tried to cook on it they replaced it with a slightly better less rusty one that can at least cook. the dryer was broken and the repair man told us he told them it was broken and that the fridge needed parts as well. things they  never mentioned to us. the fridge ruined 100 dollars worth of our food we had almost no money by this point. its still broken and they dont care now. we have to clean a few gallons of water out of the bottom of it every few days. my mother was set up to be transfered to the walmart in this town but the old walmart was mad and gave her a bad review and sent her points up by 5. so the new walmart refused to take her at this point which now means soon i will have no health insurance. i take 11 pills a day for (depression 2 pills, thyroid 1 pill, blood pressure 2 pills, nerve pain 3 pills, singular 1 pill, and 2 pills for my acid reflux) with the insurance its around 44 bucks a month but without its going to be somewhere near 200 dollars or more a month. therapist requires money at time of visit and i really need to see one because im at the point where im going to start carving people up for fun. i confided in my mom about how bad my mental state is im super fucked up from my childhood and being constantly bullied. i dream about hurting people all the time and when i get pushed really far i imagine all the ways i could torture people and how easy it would be to just slit my familys throats as they sleep. when i worked i would work so hard that i would get sick from over working my self and then not being able to sleep which i still cannot stay asleep at all. therapists are like 250 dollars a session and i feel like i need to see mine once a week. i also need to see a psychologist for my ptsd because it needs to be treated and each visit with one of them is like 750. im already 30 grand or more in dept from clinic visits a surgery and hospitilization from my suicide attempt. ive been trying so hard these past 6 months to get in better health ive lost 30 pounds im eating less and im trying to eat better. im taking all my pills like im supposed to. but i try and try and all i get the constant bitching  from my family because i havent filled any applications out even though im working with the dept of labor and rehab servicies still. i feel that if i start a job and have to deal with people who dont care about doing their job right that i will finnaly snap the final time and end up killing someone. ive snapped in the past and destroyed equipment at past jobs. im always angry. but i hate that about myself i hate my anger i hate who i am. i know the things i think are wrong and i want to be better. i grew up racist as hell thanks to my family but ive trained myself to be better in that regard. and i want to be a better person so bad. but everyone just keeps pushing me. im so lost i have 3 friends i can count on and talk to. im just tired of it. im typing from my soul here im not doing this for attention or for offers of anything. i just want someone to understand what im going through and how i feel. i think this is everything for now if you read this all thank you and im more than happy to talk in comments or pms if anyone has any questions or suggestions or criticism or anything",2018-10-07 23:21:10,Blade_0239,1

7skpv0,first post long life story,depression,the worlds been working against me from the start it seems. i was molested as a child multiple times by multiple people. beaten by my father and bullied by my siblings. ive never had very many friends or people i could rely on. parents divorced when i was 9 moved to another state. constantly bullied at school treated like shit by my grandparents i had to live with because we had no money. family is super religious and im an atheist so they spend all their time trying to convert me. got my first job at 16 and put almost all my money into bills to help my mom while my siblings did fuck all. in the last 5 years things have gotten really bad. my ex fiance of 4 years dumped me and then i found out she had been cheating on me the entire time. my mother lost her job in the nursing field and couldnt get another thanks to false accusations of abuse. my depression and anger gets so bad i constantly quit jobs or got fired because i worked my ass off and got sick of everyones laziness. 2 years ago my appendix had to be removed because it was close to bursting. i had no job and no insurance so that put me over 27k in debt which just gets higher and higher every month thanks to bill collectors. recently i took a trip to kansas with my family and ended up staying  with my best friend in a shed outside of his friends house. i have no job no money no skills terrible pains in my legs i really only have 2 friends. my family just  wants me to get a job and send my mom money because now that im not paying all the bills shes getting worse. but they just smoke weeds and drink and steal her food and use her just like they used me. tried going to doctor. took my pills. but they never did anything. i scored like 28 on the depression sheet and doctors just ignore when i tell them about my leg pain always blaming depression on it. i look at the world and i just dont want to be apart of it. all the greed and hate theres so little good in the world. i cant stand pain so killing myself just isnt feesable for me. my friends solution to my depression is to tell me im not sad and to hit me and laugh. i dont even know why im typing this so i guess this is it.,2018-01-24 06:36:47,Blade_0239,1

(topic of argument: whether or not it was begging rather than asking a favour when looking for a job) i cant exactly remember when something sparked in his mind, but he just flipped at me.ive lived a relatively comfortable, sheltered life, but there has been more and more pressure to spend less time playing around and more time working with my university studies, and work to find a part time job. for the past few months i have been tossing around a few applications (all rejection / no response) and until yesterday i hadnt dedicated much time to these (i do write my resumes to high standard, dont get me wrong).basically, when my dad flipped, he smacked his hands down on my desk (rattling some parts of my pc out of place so hard for perspective) and yelled about me about how sheltered i am and how much of a spoiled brat i was. to summarise what he told me there were two things that he said, one - ""you are so close to getting punched in the face right now, and its not child abuse any more its straight up assault"", and two - ""if you want to be treated like an adult then leave home, theres the world (points out window).""note: my dad hasnt hit me in a while, but its happened before, and hes a controlling person with a short temper and little empathy. (did hit me once when he started shouting at me) he is known to lash out from time to time, unfortunately.the world i am being forced to live in now seems like it wont end, not the good ending where you retire, but just no light at the end of the tunnel. find a part time job, work hard at uni studies, get a better job, finish degree, get a better job from 9-5, pay off debts. which reminds me, im now being forced to pay part of my pay(possibly all) - should i get a part time job in the near-distant-future as rent. i dont know if its just my sheltered self talking here but it seems a bit much to have an 18 year old already paying rent for living at home, expect them to treat university as a full time job, get a part time job, take on lots of household chores, etc. etc.im 18, ive not been properly employed per se, but have had work experience for the best part of 6 years in the same role (paid). i havent seen a therapist nor have i confided in anyone or directly implied it, nor would i ever consider confiding, but i have more than a hunch i can relate to a lot of people in this subreddit...depression is something that runs in my family too, and it sucks that not once has anyone ever stopped to ask if i was ok. i only exist when someone needs something from me. nothing is moving in the world, im not going anywhere any time soon. i honestly dont even know why im bothering to write this up now.apologies if i come across as the spoiled brat im told i am. am i in the right here? am i in the wrong? is this the typical household? i have no reference points, no one to go to and ask.its hard to confront the situation because im being threatened to be kicked out of the house. i know, now more than ever that if i get a job that can supply me with necessary funds, i will be moving out. i cannot stay here much longer, like it or not./rant/giveup/surrender*edit - clarity",2014-11-09 10:24:08,ThrowawayJ10112,0

adrmxi,sorry... but i need some help.,depression,"im posting here because its hard for people around me to understand what depression is like and after dealing with it for about 15 years now i im starting to feel like i dont even understand.im sorry if this is too much information but i grew up in a very abusive home, my father hurt me, my mom was never home, and my sister just distanced herself from me because i think she thought if she was close to me my dad would hurt her too.i moved out at 16 years old to get away from my father and have provided for myself and struggled through life since then.day in and day out  ive dealt with my depression while still working and trying to improve my life a little bit day by day...but this past year i feel like im falling apart, i have a hard time cleaning my apartment so i always have dishes piled, up my trash always needs to be taken out, i have a hard time going to the laundromat to do my laundry so im constantly really wearing dirty clothes to work...i used to love cooking but these days i cant bring myself to do much more than pop something in the oven or a microwave...i think i spend more time trying to make sure my cat is happy then i take the time to make sure im happy myself...ive completely stopped dating, its not like i cant find someone, the last date i went on was fine after i guess distance myself and stop trying because i know that the way i live and my depression is going to scare people off anyways so i might as well be alone.i used to have nightmares every night and i dont have them anymore because i smoke a lot of weed in order to help me not feel this tired feeling i have all the time and its taken away my dreams completely.but in my daily life ive started kind of seeing things out of the corner of my eye like a bug which im severely afraid of or every once in awhile a person standing in the dark when i cant sleep...these things arent there and im not sure if im seeing things or if im just paranoid and im convincing myself that somethings there...ive stopped being motivated at work i mean ive never been the most outgoing worker but i usually get things done and im fairly productive while im at work and on top of that work used to help me feel better but anymore it just feels like a huge chore...i even stepped down from a management position i worked pretty hard to get just because i was so tired all the time... i wasnt tired from the position i was just tired in general... im still tired.im so goddamn tired... if anyone bothered to actually read through all of this i am both thankful and sorry. if you have any advice for me about anything it would be nice to hear even if i might not be able to do the things that i know i need to do to make my life happy again. i guess if i could have one question of you... do you take medication?and if i could have a second question it would be who would i talk to about getting help if i dont have much money or very good insurance? thanks again to anyone who bothered to read all of this, i hope youre doing well.

abhizh,my loneliness is a choice.,lonely,"the truth is i like being alone, i like my personal space and i like doing things i enjoy without being judged or having to justify doing the things i want to do.of course i feel so lonely sometimes and wish that i had someone to share things with, to have conversations with or even to be intimate with.this is a recent realization, ive had a few people in my life recently that i slowly distance myself from without even realizing im doing it.tonight was finally when i accepted what i was doing and understood why i was doing it.its the end of the year and the start of the new one, so i met up with a girl that i had met recently and been talking to a little bit here and there so we could spend new years together, its not like i didnt have fun but on my way home i realized that my new year would have probably been a lot better if i had just stayed home and done my own thing.im still lonely and i still have this feeling like i want to have someone to share my life with but the truth is the social interaction that i get between work and hanging out with the few friends i have every once in a while might actually be all i can take. the feeling of loneliness is just a side effect of the way i choose to live my life.im not really sure why im posting this here, but i guess maybe its because i think some other people here might feel the same way and maybe reading this will help them realize it quicker than i did.happy new year everybody.

adqzkc,how depression becomes suicide,depression," ok so,i promise i am not suicidal i just, thought of this analogy to describe what feelin suicidal is like, and i want to see if others agree or think its innacurateso, imagine you are on a deserted island. you walk out to look  for food, you do this for several days. as youi look, you see a certain animal here and there but you think its too cute or weird / dangerous looking to eat - some reasoning causes you to not want to eat he animal so you leave it alone and you keep going. the days go by and youre not finding foos. you find yourself starving after a week and suddenly your perspective on things changes, how you see your situation changes. you then see the animal again as you are starving. you dont even have time to think whether you want to eat it, you dont evewn ask, you just start running after it, you grab a weapon and use it to kill the animal, and perhaps, once this is achieved, you dont even cook it in a fire, you jsut eat the animal . . .the island here is depression, when you have depression, you feel isolated and like no one is around to help you. your food situation is your resources for fighting depression- maybe you find some food or resources at first but for one reason or another, you eventgually run out of it. no people are able to find you, because depression, your isolation, makes it difficult to reach out to other people.that animal you meet, is suicidal ideology. it crosses your mind , like it may cross your path, but you are able to reason with it and not commit the act. however ihn this scenario, time goes on, and you cant find a way to save yourself or be saved by others, and all of your resources get spent up, eventually you become desperate, and your brain changes. suddenly the suicidal thought comes up again- and its not something you consider / reason with this time- you just go for it without thinking and kill yourselfthis is how depression evolves into suicide.do yall think this is a good  analogy? was thinking of maybe using this for tyhe panel i mentioned earlierif this is too dark, ill delete",2019-01-08 07:21:38,StardustNyako,1

6tbss7,most people say the way i feel is normal and healthy.. but it seems so wrong to me. i feel like i'm stuck outside of myself.,depression,"im a survivor of parental sexual and physical abuse. my father is currently in jail while i sit here waiting to find out if i have to testify. im a survivor of adult rape by who i thought was a very good long term friend.  i have cptsd following years of neglect, abuse, homelessness, and hunger. the abuse and neglect started when i was 6 and my sister died, and it continued escalating until there was so much bitter hatred between myself and my family i was forced out at 17. i was angry, volatile, scared and had little impulse control. i hadnt processed the levels of abuse and slowly unraveled it during my early adult years. i just didnt care about my safety. i basically fled to another state where i jumped around from place to place. i made some amazing memories and some...not so amazing ones. i cant say i regret it all, but im amazed im alive. there were nights i slept with some nice enough stranger just so i had a bed to sleep in. cut to a few years later: i moved back to my home state with a boy whod been in love with me for years. he was such a good, caring friend. i thought, finally, things are changing. we lived together for two years and i became pregnant. somehow, he morphed into an alcoholic, lying to me on a daily basis, cheating on me and leaving me when i was 8 months along. it was probably there all along, and i just was too willfully blind to see it. so, i had my beautiful son and moved back in with my narcissistic mother and was a single mother for two years. during that time, i suffered terrible post-partum. when i went to a psychiatrist, i was incorrectly diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put immediately on a high dose of lithium. the side effects i experienced were beyond horrible. he refused to see me immediately when i begged to be taken off of it. i legitimately thought i was losing my mind. i hallucinated, i couldnt sleep but i was so tired all of the time. my emotions were a roller coaster. i went to a counselor to talk, and while breaking down about the medication and the exhaustion, about the abuse and the loneliness -  she determined i was suicidal even though that was never even close to being said. to be fair, she was very new and im sure i made her worried, but its hard to forgive her for what came next. i was arrested from there and put into a psychiatric hospital for a week. my mother refused to visit with my son, and i lost my job. i was force fed antipsychotics that made me hallucinate further, and wasnt allowed a xanax even when surrounded by schizophrenic patients who urinated on my clothes and threw a chair at me. let me tell you - the movies where they seem to exaggerate sane people being stuck in places like that, having meds pushed down their throat and being treated like any natural reaction is them having a psychotic break - it is too accurate. on top of everything, i was injured at work and have herniated discs in my neck, which at 29 causes me daily chronic pain. i refuse to rely on narcotics, but i cant do as much as i used to. and i used to do a lot. my energy levels are horrible and i hate the way i look. i suppose thats normal when youre a skinny teenager being told youre fat by your parents. however - by all accounts, my life is a good one now. my financial problems are working themselves out. i have an amazing husband and my son is 5 and starting kindergarten and such an amazing little ball of joy and sweetness. i have a decent job which allows me some flexibility. i have a car and a bed and three awesome cats and i dont ever have to worry about not eating. i think i appreciate the small stuff so much more now. i just... i feel so disconnected. i jump back and forth between anxiety and depression and gratitude and happiness - but the negative far outweighs the positive. i work full time with people, so afterward i all too easily slip into my emotional hidey-hole and quit talking to my loved ones, what few i maintain anyway. i fight it daily because i want better for my son and my wonderful partner, but it usually feels like nails on a chalkboard. its painfully draining. ive gone from a fun and passionate extrovert to a cold and disconnected introvert. i intend to be warm and compassionate and end up being the asshole who cancels plans or doesnt text back. truthfully, just talking to people exhausts me. most people have no idea who i really am and the thought of explaining it in close proximity to those who dont understand is just draining - even those closest to me. most of those who knew me when i was in the thick of it, who went through hell and back as well... well, theyve either killed themselves or we just went our separate ways. i dont trust counselors or psychiatrists. i dont know if i trust myself to be consistent with medication. ive tried support groups but i inevitably just... stop going. a switch flips and i shut off. i dont even know what im looking for on here. this may not be completely coherent. i dont expect anyone to read through this mess or respond really. i guess i just needed to say all of it to both everyone who might actually understand, and nobody in particular at all.

adpuzq,i starved my depression out,depression,"\-obligatory trigger warning (for everything)-tl;dr: stopped eating for 40 hours, my mental problems have somehow disappeared (for now, which im already so grateful for).so i just went through a very heartbreaking break up.felt like shit, the relationship was a huge support for me and honestly, it was not anyones fault it happened. i already have depression and a lot of relationship/trust problems and all of this breakup crap made me so, so, so lonely i literally just wants to end it. i think everyone here somewhat relates to how this feel.now, whenever something like this happens my go-to move is to **eat**, a lot. ice cream, chocolate, cookies etc. im a huge emotional eater. after i binge eat i either become more defeated and depressed or i straight up purge it out. its not pretty, and i always feel a lot worse after. however, this time, i told myself to *fuck it*. how about i just slowly starve myself to death. (that was the initial thought process at least). im not gonna start eating until i either 1. feel better or 2. die.if youre familiar with maslows hierarchy of needs, you might be able to guess what happened. i continued to be very sad maybe 18 hours into not eating anything, but by the 40th hour, my brain completely decided to ignore any mental problems and just focused on the hunger.i then proceeded to eat a very normal amount and its almost as if someone has hit a reset button with my brain. i can now get out of bed, and for the first time in months i read a little (a hundred years of solitude) and will start trying to study and write again.&#x200b;the moral of the story is, if you are considering to emotionally eat, maybe try emotionally *not eat* instead.&#x200b;\---also, intermittent fasting is not right for everyone, but i think im gonna continue this 40/8 thing.

adl6ir,"worried that i'm slipping into being depressed again, like last year...",depression,"i graduated last year with my degree in finance. my mom moved to the middle of nowhere in a house she couldnt afford. after 6 months of being stagnant there and working at home depot for a month or so (no other jobs close by, no car, no public transportation) i moved to nc.while with my mom, i was depressed. i was so far out in the middle of nowhere, far from *anything*. there wasnt even a bus nearby for me to go into the city. id stay up till 5am, sleep until 2pm, watch porn and play ps4 all day...no friends or anything nearby and it was an hour long drive to the nearest city worth going to. barely even found it fun to make music, my main hobby.eventually i moved down south to nc with grandparents...ive never liked the south but it was better here because there were more job opportunities. long story short, through a temp agency i worked with wells fargo twice (both times they fired 100+ temps within a week), starbucks for a month, and costco as a seasonal. overall i saved up $2000ish. still cant pay down my student loans $43k at this point...back to job searching and nothing feels different at all besides me having a little money. i dont have any friends here and i can barely get in contact with my cousins to hang out. i havent really been trying to because they arent exactly into doing the things i am anyways.the original plan was that if i didnt have a job by november id move to atl with my dad. 3 or so months ago he went to rehab for drinking and has been clean and much better overall. he works at the atl airport. he wouldve been my first choice but he was drinking at the time. (un)fortunately costco called back...at least they paid $14/hr.im getting tired of living with grandparents and its not like i have friends here, so i might as well leave for atl soon. ive tried looking on meetup, organizing a meetup through reddit (nobody showed up), and nothing...i might check meetup again. the *only* thing keeping me here at this point is this one cool arcade bar i frequent, and working on various projects with my grandfather. i feel like an idiot for taking out 40k in loans. my degree is worthless, i have no network here, and can barely even get a job in my field. id be better off selling coke and weed to frat boys at the local college. it feels like ill never get a job. everyone has advice on what i should be doing but no jobs offers lol.a lot of the clubs on meetup are interesting, but based on the photos, id be the *only* black guy in the club...im thinking of checking out the african american hiking club...its not that i dont like hanging with other races/cultures, but ive been the only black dude before, and its kinda not all that fun.my goals for this year are to finally buy a car (my price limit $3000-$4000), to put out a music ep project, and to stop watching so much damn porn. ive downloaded a ""panic button"" and im trying to read books in place of that.lets hope atlanta is better.",2019-01-07 21:27:22,Naima_,1

adkels,the psychiatrist tricked me.,depression,"i dont know if this belongs here, but i was just so outraged and stressed from the whole situation... im not really sure where to go to talk about this. basically ive had major depression since i was 10. fast forward 11 years and  im now starting to get help for myself. i called my health insurance company for help finding a therapist (none of the therapists around me answered my calls). so. i ended up having to go 30 minutes out of my way each time to see this therapist the insurance company found. that was annoying, but not undo-able. i eventually stopped seeing the therapist when she scared me by making me think she was going to lock me up. so basically i just saw the psychiatrist for medicine recommendations. i only mention the therapist because she was basically the first red flag that i wasnt seeing the best people for my problem. they tested a few medications on me, but none of them worked. some even made my depression worse than it already was. by this time, this therapy business hired a new psychiatrist; lets call him chris. chris was obviously just out of school. he was young and definitely seemed inexperienced. he was the one who prescribed me my last medication. after a short q and a with me telling him the problems ive been having most recently, he gave me a business card that he had scribbled a name of a program the local hospital ""supposedly"" provided. he basically told me that they would be able to better help me. one important thing to note is that i clearly told him that i wasnt suicidal lately. so off i went to the local hospital. chris told me to go to the emergency entrance, so thats where i went. i showed the receptionist the card that had the program name on it and she didnt even seemed fazed. she told me to wait and someone would be with me.after a bit of waiting and a screening with who i think was a nurse, i was instructed to dress down and put on a hospital gown. i was a bit confused at this point, but complied since i figured it would make things go smoother and quicker. that and i had no idea what to expect. then i was put into a room. i wasnt allowed to have anything. i was told that i needed to wait for the crisis counselor. it was at that moment i realized what had happened. these people thought i was suicidal. like at that moment i wanted to kill myself. which wasnt the case. i tried to explain this to the nurse keeping watch, but he wasnt having it. i began to feel scared. i texted my boyfriend before going to the hospital that i was supposed to go to some program, but that was it. none of my loved ones knew what was happening to me at that moment. i was literally trapped with no way of leaving. i told the nurse through my tears that people would be wondering where i was, but he just shrugged. my boyfriend who had experience with things like this had a feeling about what happened to me when i didnt text him a few hours later. he was the one who notified my mother on where i was. im still incredibly thankful to him for that. i waited over 9 hours in that room for the ""crisis counselor"" to speak to me. about 6 of those hours i had literally nothing to do. eventually the nurse thought it would be a good idea to find the remote for the television. by the end of it all, i was incredibly stressed, but kind of passive at the same time. i had so many explosions of negative emotions, i cried so much that i felt completely drained by the end of it. i had dark rings under my eyes. i looked like absolute death. the only good thing to come out of it is that the crisis counselor seemed confused when i told him that i was not currently suicidal and that i was sent here with this card by the psychiatrist. he had me give him the card and he disappeared for a little bit. i can only hope he gave that company a harsh talking to. im never going back to either that hospital or that psychiatrist.

6v0qcs,should i feel guilty for being mentally ill?,mentalhealth,"for the past week, ive been having sleep hallucinations every. single. night. every time i try to go back to sleep, another one decides to come up. i have gotten less than 15 hours of sleep in 4 days. ive been living off energy drinks during my work shifts and naps. for a bit of an explanation, the hallucinations are most commonly spiders. now, i used to be nervous around spiders before, but i was still able to dispose of them with a napkin. now, the years of spider hallucinations have caused me to develop a very strong fear of them. i know its pathetic, but i cant help it. recently, theres been a spider problem in my house. ive been finding them around a lot. i dont know where they are coming from and ive been trying to take steps to prevent them. but they still come around and like to hang out in my room and around the hallway. ive been battling this one spider for the past 4 days now. my father killed it tonight, but before that, its been causing me trouble along with the other hallucinations. im hearing voices and hearing noises now. three nights ago i first heard these two unfamiliar male voices talking outside my door. they were speaking unintelligible things at the same time. two nights ago, one voice said something that terrified me.  i heard the sound of something heavy falling in the bathroom next to me room and then this-""bang! the spider is back."" i dont remember exactly what it said since i was in full panic mode, but it definitely said either ""bang"" or ""boom"" and something about the spider being back and maybe something about it being on the ceiling. when i opened my eyes and turned on the lights, the same spider i had been trying to kill for days was above my head on the ceiling. i lost it once more and i had to have my boyfriend come get me. at this point i was exhausted, very tightly wound and horribly skittish. my chest was burning and my heart was pounding from exhaustion. i was on the verge of tears. i knew i was going crazy and i had just woken my boyfriend up at 3 in the morning in a terror filled state. i still feel guilty about it... tonight he made it clear that i either needed to get help or he couldnt be with me anymore. weve been together for almost 5 years now and along with the hallucinations, i have other mental illnesses. ive tried to get help many times, but it isnt working out. im waiting for morning so i can call the doctor about the hallucinations... i know i need at least antidepressants and antipsychotics. tonight, my boyfriend asked if i was high because of my obsession with this spider that had been terrorizing me. he made it clear that it was ridiculous and he got upset with me because he got a flat tire running over a nail in his driveway. he was coming to get rid of the spider once and for all even though i told him i was going to take care of it with a vacuum. he admitted to waiting to long to fill his tires with air and that contributing to his tire troubles, but he still came off as blaming me for it.i offered to pay for his new set of tires, but he declined saying he would break up with me if i left him money. he said he was fed up and he would deal with it himself. should i be feeling guilty for my mental health problems causing so much trouble? i definitely feel guilty, but i also feel confused with his outburst at me... he said that it was okay up until today.. i even apologized... i know this fear is irrational, but ive had hallucinations of spiders crawling all over me for a while now and im just so terrified of them now...

6nf0d6,severe sleep hallucinations,mentalhealth,"i currently only have less than an hour of sleep in my system and am running on pure fear fueled adrenaline, so please be kind regarding my writing skills. i have no idea how long this has been going on, but it started out with me shooting out of bed during a particularly bad nightmare (i think i was being tormented by an evil spirit in the dream) and trying frantically to turn on my light while still half asleep. after that, i would get woken up suddenly to see thousands of spiders all around me. they started out skinny like daddy long-legs and eventually became the dark black horrors i saw not even an hour ago. they crawled all over my body, my sheets, and my walls. i went to turn my lights on only to see a mass of black, wriggling arachnids coating that too. i immediately fled my room and ended up in my bathroom. and what do you know, i see an honest to god spider just chilling on my counter. it was little, but in my terrified state, i came to the conclusion that i had to kill it. i miss and this thing decides to jump at me. i dodge and it falls to the ground. the spider is currently chilling under a cup on the floor because im too freaked out to deal with it anymore. the spiders are only the most common of my hallucinations. ive seen a white, glowing human figure behind my bedroom door and black shadows throughout my room. i slept over at my boyfriends house once and woke up to see a tall, black shadow leaning over at me. nothing was there. i know im going crazy. i just feel so worn out from all this... i dont know what to do.

8qx1cj,feeling like people hate you for small things,Anxiety,"this happened a few years ago, my 2 friends and i were going to the movie theatre and i bought a large popcorn for all of us. i put a lot of butter (even more than i liked by accident) and they took a look at it and looked at eachother and just said theyd get their own. i felt like such an idiot and i thought they hated me.they both had one butterless popcorn together while i had a whole large to myself which made me look like a glutton. they seemed so disgusted by the butter i put on the popcorn and i felt like some gross creature... i was on the verge of tears over popcorn.i later clarified with them if they were angry with me because of it and they seemed so confused, as if it was preposterous that i would come to that conclusion.i realised that i was taking things more seriously than they were and that nobody hates you for something so minor. can anybody else relate?",2018-06-14 02:18:24,aicheo,1

""therapy"" is basically like talking to a mute for an hour. i cant even afford it. and yes, even the sliding scale affordability option is too expensive for me, i can;t afford medication, i havent been diagnosed because apparently my depressive symptoms are not severe enough to mean anything. great. so what i feel is completely normal? awesome. medication is like a bandaid on an amputated leg anyway. so basically there is /no/ treatment. yes, you can talk your feelings out and chug xanax but it means and does nothing, your real problem will never be solved and the only real solution is suicide. anything else is lying to yourself. fuck being alive and fuck the constant struggle and people telling you it gets better. ah yes, raising house prices, shit wages, lack of mental health support, no social life, im sure itll magically get better.",2018-02-09 11:08:24,aicheo,1

8jpn63,is there a point to any of this? are we just characters in a book? do we have any control?,depression,"these are basically the questions i’ve been struggling with my whole life. were we just doomed into our current situation from the start? is it really hopeless? in order for you to be here in this life, it takes two people. so your whole life and the person you’ll become is left at their mercy. i know some of our personality is genetic but for the most part what we are is a collection of our memories, experiences. all of our experiences define who we are today, if our life went in a different direction, we would be a totally different person than the one we are now. these parents are the architects to our life. i would describe life as a tree. before you’re born this tree as infinite branches, but as you come to the world branches die one by one. any decision a parent makes cuts off many branches. by the time we get the reins, our life can only go a certain way, there is only so much potential left. if we are fortunate we’ll have parents that will give us reins to a path with high potential or if you’re like me, you’ll be left with a tree with the only branch that is death. what i was trying to convey in this paragraph is that we are not concrete or set in stone we only became who we are because of the information our senses captured and our brain processed. so what i struggle with is, what makes us unique or purposeful when we are a product of our storyline. are just characters in a book?, do we have any control?  everything we believe to be true of our self, all our insecurities, our strengths, our weaknesses. they are all learned attributes for the most part, genetics also plays a key role. athletic parents are going to create athletic babies to counter this argument i can say genes come from your parents and my tree analogy kinda works. our life was a hair length away from happiness to sadness. the only reason i’m thinking this right now is because this result my brain came up with when it processed the information from my senses. isn’t it kinda boring playing along when we are actually not authors but characters in a book by destiny? luck? i’m not trying to say i’m right, this is 100% the truth. it’ll be stupid the say that after i saw how much evolution my though went through my whole life. is there ever a true answer when everything is left to destiny? at this point i’m just so confused.

adfgx3,it feels like a hit a wall with the potential for my happiness,depression,"i have been depressed for almost over a decade and it seems that nothing i do can get me out of this depressive mode. i keep trying to pursue my passion in music and djing but that has not been cheering me up as much as it used to. i haven’t felt the spark of joy in a long time and the only time i can get remotely close to that spark is when i’m in a relationship with someone, being in a relationship also really motivates me but i have decided to stop dating because going through heartbreaks and toxic relationships were making my depression worse and causing major beatdowns to my already low self esteem. i find myself constantly trying to fill the void of emptiness that lies inside of me but it seems to do just as good as duct tape and water. i’m trying to go back to school in a few months but i haven’t been able to get excited about it and i’m worried that i won’t be disciplined enough to get the best experience out of my schooling and fully apply myself to the schoolwork. i really want to be happy on my own and i want to build my self esteem and it seems like every time i am with friends, i have nothing exciting to update them about. “hey guys, today i just sat at home, overslept, and wasted my time playing video games” is what comes up when they ask how my day has been. i keep seeing my peers accomplishing things and moving forward in life while i’m stuck in this rut giving only about a 60% effort to anything that i do. i got into a nasty habit of partying 4 years ago that has slowly made me lose myself more and i just recently stopped partying because the heavy drinking and substances i was doing were only causing my problems to worsen in the long run. i feel like i often find myself seeking outside approval from others and that i am a chameleon of everyone around me. i never got to really know who i am so how can i love myself if i don’t know who i am? i work at a retail store and at work i feel very drained and don’t fully put in the best of my effort. i see all of my coworkers talking to eachother, getting praised by the managers, and getting along. i feel very left out at work and putting on a fake smile for customers makes me cringe. i know life is short and i really want to make the best of my time rather than passing it. it sucks to say that i don’t value life as much as i should and i felt very indifferent about a car accident i was involved in that nearly killed me. i get jealous when i see people enjoying themselves on the simple pleasures of life like dancing at bars, cheering at shows, and watching movies etc. i’m often told that i’m too smart for my own good and i believe that my awareness of the planet and what people do sort of makes me feel bored in a way. depression and heartbreaks are awful but nothing feels worse than being almost literally bored with everything you do.. i really dislike the holidays because they slap me in the face with “you should be more happy it’s (insert holiday here)” i would give anything to be motivated, find myself, and be passionate again.

9iakmn,why it’s hard to reach out in a crisis/suicidal state.,SuicideWatch,"i don’t claim to speak for everyone on this matter as everyone has different experiences but it is not as easy as people think to reach out to others when in a crisis/suicidal state. this is because you are so far into negative thoughts, self image, and self doubt etc. that you fail to believe that even your bestest of friends are really there for you, at least for me that is. i have had many crisis and suicidal ideations, even went to the hospital once for an attempt. i find that in this state i can’t ever make my mind on who to reach out to or call because i’m always telling myself that “i’ll get over it” or that “i’ll waste someone’s time” when i reach out. it is not easy to ask for help in a crisis state and i believe this is why a lot of suicides happen unannounced. i wish the suicide hotline wouldn’t come storming in to your home with a team of police when you mentioned that you want to “end it all” to them. i find that all you need in a crisis moment is just someone to be there for you and take you out of your vortex. they don’t have to fix your problems, just take you out on a car ride or simply hanging out does so many wonders and really saves lives.

7zewli,just a trick that helped me deal with a good portion of my depression,depression,"i believe a big part of depression is self forgiveness. i’m obviously no therapist nor am i a statistician by any means but from talking among mutual depressed friends, i came to a conclusion that among our bad self image, we tend to torture ourselves with memories and think back about moments where we felt humiliated, regret, rejected etc. and we bring those things into our present sad mood. the tip is to realize experience and negative moods as separate entities. its a way to reprogram your brain to practicing letting go and self-forgiveness.your experiences(things you did, choices you made, people you have met, accomplishments/failures etc.) are what built who you are today and what got you where you are now, you are probably wondering“but these are the things that made me depressed now??” but just bear with me here:these experiences by no means define who you are as a person! people are always capable of changing, they just have to choose to start and to trust. look for a place to forgive yourself for the shit you did back then or the grief you went through. the big picture is that these experiences are lessons that either strengthened you or taught you an important lesson. you will never repeat the same mistakes you constantly think back about and eventually when allowed enough time to, you will fully process that grief. pain has a shelf life so don’t let anyone tell you to hold that shit in. we are not sad simply because of the choices we made and what happened to us in the past, we are sad because sadness just simply is, just like happiness, the world, negative/positive and everything else. we stay sad when we keep telling ourselves over and over again that we fucked up and we think something is punishing us when in reality we are punishing ourselves. i’m still battling depression myself, it is very tough, especially for very active minds. but no matter how many things i improved in my life, i still felt the sadness, somedays for no reason at all only to find my brain trying to dig up a bad memory to give it reason.hope this helps, just keep faith and forgive yourselves!",2018-02-22 15:34:46,savagesaucez,1

""why couldnt i get my act together before it was to late?"" its hard to explain.. i hurted my mother and stepdad with my selfishness and stupidity, and now both of them are dead.  theres no way i can make amends now.  once you die,  its over.  youre fucked..  i remember as a child,  i had this feeling my mom was going to die pretty soon,  but i will always push that voice in the back of my head.  and now look... the only people i can make amends with are my stepslibings.  and i lost contact with them 14 years ago. reconciling with them is basically pointless,  to much time has passed.  including,  im pretty sure they have families of their own.  its to late.. im sorry for rambling guys,  but this burdening me down since i was 7 years olds.  sometimes i feel like im in a bad dream,  and once i wake up none of this shit is real.  the guilt, regret, and self loathing is the biggest factor to my depression.  and i see no solution to get it fix.  how do you guys deal with this type of burden? how do you live your lives everyday,  knowing you cant make amends with the loved ones you hurted or make up lost time? i honestly feel like im living in a bad dream.  since im the last person alive for my family line  carrying the last name of lewis i cant wait to i die.  i dont have to be burden with this pain and i dont have to spread down a family line that is already fucked up.  i just need some people to talk to and can relate to my pain i been feeling for 14 years.  my advice to you teenagers or anyone out there,  get your shit together with your love ones or even strangers.  because once theyre dead and you didnt make amends with them youre fuck.. im being totally honest with you.sorry for my grammar mistakes.

8n5rw0,how to let things be? how to become numb? story below,depression,"forgive my grammar mistakes.  i think for a while now,  i know what is causing my depression and there is no way to fix it. my childhood was not good. i seen a lot of things children should not look at or experience. first off i never knew my father. all i know he was a drug addict and he is dead. i dont even know his first or last name.  my last name comes from one of my mom ex boyfriends.  so technically i have real last name. my mother passed away when i was 7 years old. she died from aids. before her death, i had this strong gut feeling she is going to die soon.  i swear.  i was around six years old when i had that feeling.  i had no idea she was sicked. my mother death played a major part to my depression. however, there is something else.  my stepdad and his children.  my stepdad was an outcast by society standards.  they will label him ""white trash"". originally he was from louisiana.  half of his family was kind and sweet.  the other half was racist... before my mom went to the hospital for the last time,  me, my stepdad, and i went to the beach. that was the one very last time i will spend time with the both of them at the same time.  shortly after my mom went to the hospital for the last time.  during that time my stepdad was stressed about the bills and my mother in the hospital. including,  i was always getting in trouble in school... i found out later during my life,  when my stepdad left me alone in the apartments at night,  i was told he was smoking crack in the apartment complex washing and dryer room.  my stepdad was hiv and an acholloic. the stress of my mother dying in the hospital, me acting up constantly as a child,  and his own kids pushed him to start doing drugs.  i remember the last time he talked to me. i was in my room watching cartoons and he told me he will deal with me later because i got in trouble in school that day.  i remember looking him in the eyes and just shrugging my shoulders at him... the next morning my life change forever.  as i was about to walk out the front door for school,  i remember it liked yesterday, my stepdad pushed me on the couch and start choking me.  i swear on my life.  i was so afraid. while he was choking me, his son watched in fear. my stepbrother and stepsister was probably 13 or 14. anyway i somehow escaped my stepdad and ran to aunt apartment door.  my mom and aunt used to lived in the same apartment complex . after that incident my aunt raised me to i turned 18. the last time i heard from my stepsister was on the phone before my mom died in the hospital.  i remember her promising me i will hang out with her again.  that never happened.. my stepsister was in the same room with my mother when she died.  on the day of my mothers funeral my stepdad was supposed to attend,  but i was told he was arrested on a warrant on the day of my mothers funeral.  as a small child,  i always knew i will be alone.  i swear.  my depression mainly  comes from missing my mom, stepdad, stepsister,  and stepbrother.  i have a lot of self loath.  i wish i was a better child to my mother  before she was in the hospital/dying in the hospital! i wish i didnt cause my stepdad to start doing drugs because of the additional stressed i caused on him! if i had honestly been a better child a lot of my depression will not be here! i cant say sorry to my mom,  because she is dead! i cant say sorry to my stepdad because he is dead! i have no idea if my stepsister or stepbrother are okay!! i have no idea what happened to them! they were kids too! there is a possibility theyre dead too! and if theyre not dead,  theres a chance they forgotten about me... i think about my past everyday. i always wonder how things will play out back then if i wasnt so stupid as a child .. i have no idea how to find my stepdad and stepsister.  i just want to make peace with them,  i swear on my life! i only know their  first name. not their  last name.  my stepdad named was todd, stepsister was amber,  and stepbrother was alex. this is where most of my depression and self loathing comes from.  i need someone to vent and talk to.. i never told anyone this.  definitely with details.  sorry for the grammar mistakes. i need help.  im not afraid to admit.  im scared and alone . i been like this since i was 7 years old.",2018-05-30 07:34:31,black-trash-man,1

93971r,everything is falling apart in life and i'm tired of acting like everything is ok,depression,"all through out high school my home life has been a mess. my older brother has serious mental issues, anger issues and ocd, and has repetitively gotten in trouble with the law to many times to count, mostly for selling drugs of all sorts and gang affiliated crimes. just a year ago, he bought two doberman puppies home with out asking, he hasnt trained them in the least bit, and they are so mentally scarred from him telling at the top of his lungs at them and keep them locked up in a disgusting room for most of the day. they are sweet dogs, but they need help, just this year they both got in a terrible fight with each other ending with both of them in critical condition. i hate having to deal with this, but i cant confront my brother about this because its dangerous as he literally hates my guts and can get physical, all i can do is watch and help make sure the dogs are safe. my parents havent fared any better, my father, the person my brother fights with the most, in unable to deal with the situation in a healthy way, and has taken to supplements, exploding at small things, and critiquing others to help himself. in a way hes the worst one as every conversation in some way belittles you or someone else, or turns into hour long rants about small little human errors. it became the job of my mom and me to contain the situation in what ever way possible (this mostly means hiding evidence that there is something wrong), i feel like im babysitting two adult children.in just this one year, i had to deal with two unwanted dogs, a swat team destroying my house, some one throwing three bricks into my house, a absolutely bloody and deathly dog fight, and having to put down my pet gecko ive been taking care for a year after my brother abandoned it (geckos are super sensative to their environment, my brothers room is gross).my two younger siblings are to young to understand the situation.it getting hard to keep everything together, its like a never ending night mare, i feel hollow inside and i cant talk about it with my mom because it freaks her out. this kind of turned into a rant, but i feel like i have to say this somewhere or its like it never happened, given the nature of how my family deals with stress. sometimes i just start crying for nothing, ive put on so much weight, and i am forced to stay home via guilt to help deal with this whole mess.i think my will power is starting to disappear",2018-07-31 02:26:29,GalacticLawnmower,1

96jacd,the greatest trick depression ever pulled was convincing you it didn't exist...,depression,"*sadly, this was swept under in automated tooling, and it didnt get posted when it was most poignant. im not as bad today, but i can feel it on the dark side of my mind and it will come back to haunt me again, and im curious about how people will respond to it.*  i  had a line of thinking today that i wanted to bring up to people, and  that is the existence of depression, and the idea that it is almost  sentient in its way of convincing you of its existence or lack thereof.  to be clear, im not denying its presence; this last week has been  highly traumatic for me and ive pushed everyone in my life away. i  found this subreddit in a painful moment of looking for ways to die  peacefully, and then about the frequency of those who are out there who  dont want to die, but also do not want to exist. i would love nothing  more than to observe the world, if i could, and never be a part of  anyones life but merely to haunt the planet. i would settle for  complete darkness - nonexistence.but  ive got a peculiar habit, and i want to see how many other people have  this and what it might mean. this habit being the daily struggle of  believing in my own condition; there is never an episode that isnt  followed with the complete denial that an episode needed to occur. i am  plagued by a constant recurring thought that im lazy, that i could  easily achieve what i want to do if i would just do it, and that failure  to do it requires debilitating shame. which is ironic, because im  paralyzed by my anxiety and depression, but my inability to do simple  things (call and ask why my water was disconnected, telling someone why i  cant show today even though i told them for the third time i would,  applying for food stamps even though ive started the process four times  and never followed through) seems to stem from that very paralyzation.  it is one contradiction in my life out of a million: i love socializing  but i do not want to be around people, my room is a complete disgusting  mess but i cant stand dirty dishes in the sink, i believe in the  inherent good of all humanity, but humanity makes me sick.  i want to  scream out for help so badly, but bind and gag myself because ""everyone  else has it worse and nobody would really be able to help you more than  yourself anyway.""therapy never worked  for me, i cant afford medication, and i needed medicaid only once in my  life and im pretty sure its expired now. or whatever the hell happens  to medicaid when you leave it alone in a strange place like a five year  old with add. it was for a recent appendectomy that the doctor had  botched and almost killed me. after surgery i had problems waking up and  aspirated, ended up with a flash pulmonary edema, and spent the next  week in hallucinatory hell where i saw literally hell. i couldnt sleep  because every time i closed my eyes i was dying or witnessing horrendous  things. i wish at that point - and again now - that i had never made it  out. but the worst part of it is that no matter what, i manage to  convince myself that im making all of this up in my head.its  hard to tell where i am at the moment with this last episode. i say  ""episode,"" but my general demeanor is at least functioning. ask me any  day of the week how im doing, and the response will always be ""im  hanging in there"" or ""im still alive, i think."" i find myself - as  noted in the song of the same name - comfortably numb. i accept that my  life is pointless and headed nowhere, and i fight on with the hope that  ill just poof! wake up one day and start my music career (even though  deep down i know thats not how it will or ever has worked). the only  solace i can find outside of sleep is playing wow and listening to arin  hanson and dan avidan from game grumps, and occasionally ill hear dan  talk about his depression and i wish i could just... pull him up to me  and ask him what the \*\*\*\* he does to stay alive. but... the last few  days have rendered me unable to communicate with others, an inexplicable  dread that pushes me down whenever i think i might be able to talk to  someone, a deep-seated fear of achieving any minor obligation. i always  believed i would never try to kill myself because i know how badly it  would hurt others. these few days have made me question that resolve. i  cant tell you if im on an ""upswing"" or a ""downswing"" because when  everything is dark and youve spent so long rolling around in it, you  cant tell so easily whats up or down anymore.so  how is it that, at the end of all this, i can let the thought creep in  that this isnt actually a problem? that im taking advantage of a  generational ""fad"" and blaming all my problems on something i cant  claim responsibility for because im lazy? how can you tell someone who  normalizes dread and fear that their depression is a real issue? and  lets be honest, what would change my mind that id be worth fixing out  of the billion of us ants that continue on in history without a passing  thought?  i began this journey wanting to be a musician, a star, a  somebody.unique.you know, just like everyone else.",2018-08-11 22:45:57,Merancapeman,1

ade39x,it’s like i was in a terrible accident and i have realized i can leave the car but i can’t stop looking at all the blood and i don’t trust the people there to help.,depression,"does anyone else struggling with depression and the failure to thrive feel like medications just make them so numb they can’t actually engage their trauma? can’t learn from pain?  can’t address character flaws and historical problems?a little background. actually a lot...sorry this is really so long.  you can jump to the tldr...i have been fighting depression, add and anxiety pretty much since i was 12--im approaching 50 now. the roots of these diagnoses i suspect are deep in my parents early divorce, probable attachment disorder and intermittent emotional neglect and psychological abuse.  i was diagnosed at 16 and had some good luck with anti-depression meds at first.  my mainstay coping mechanisms, though, developed in early college:  alcohol and weed.  i did take meds intermittently, but never felt great about big pharmas game and the results were so mixed that although i was often using anti-depressants and stimulants, i mostly tried to self medicate, plus drinking and getting high were socially acceptable and encouraged in my friend groups.  i also fell in love in early adulthood, and 18 years later i’m divorced with a (now 10 year old) son.  and although we had a good 12 years, the final years of marriage were awful.  the sobriety of parenting together undid us, and i firmly believe it was in no small part because we no longer were able to numb out on booze together.  plus i was not able to get it up (thanks years of weed and meds!) which of course did not help the reduction of intimacy that often follows a first child.  years of resentment boiled up as we proved to be more and more out of love as our beautiful baby became a boy.  my ex dealt with our dysfunction by sleeping with my trusted “friend”. the ugly end of literally the only beneficial family relationship i had left, that seemed unshakable only years before, also happened at about the same time as my career collapse, something that also seemed unlikely.  in that same year my marriage shattered, i had to walk out of the elementary classroom i taught to be tried before hr for the decline of my abilities, only to lose my composure so entirely that i had to go home mid-day without even saying good-bye to the students.  i went on long term disability the next day for my mental state and never returned to that school or classroom teaching.   my son’s age at the unraveling of our relationship, being almost identical to my own when my folks split, caused any healing i had done from that trauma to explode and fester.  i was going through all this as we marched through the stages of pre-trial divorce.  at the time i was given more and more meds to help me through, and i kicked regular substance use entirely, dropping decades worth of friendships (built on substances) from my life.  now it is almost 6 years later and i have had some successes (reduced my meds, still living without substances, steady employment) but have very little to show for a life at my age.  yes i am a consistent and loving dad (i know that is not a small thing, and i’m proud of that) with 50% custody but my income is just barely enough to allow me to live in the gentrified neighborhood my son knows and loves, that is near his mom, his school and his friends.  i have a career i can handle without having to be on tons of meds (nannying for a wealthy family) but i do not have any growth opportunities there, no prestige, no long term plan, no benefits, no retirement.  i am living paycheck to paycheck.  and even though i did have a positive relationship after the divorce for a couple of years, i am alone now and after a year of online dating and some near misses, i feel like from the outside i am a man without a future, without money, without an extended family and without ambition (beyond not being depressed).  although i look pretty good, i have persistent foot pain and low energy. i feel like i stink of mid-life collapse and i am losing faith that i will ever be able to attract anyone who can help me be the person i am capable of being, someone that i can love and be loved by.so back to my question:  since my sobriety and recent reduction of medications (this past year), i have become much less numb to my pain and tragic history. i am feeling all the feelings. as i have made my life smaller and more manageable i have tried to confront the feelings that drive so much of my inner conflict.  i have delved into many books, self-guided classes and attempts at living a more healthy life.  i have gone deeper into psychotherapy than i ever could have on all those meds, but i am so deflated and tired  from the depth of the lows, that i wonder if really feeling my feelings is going to help me anymore.  i have been able to find a few core things that i can tell really do help me (yoga, exercise, journaling, low-inflammation dieting, meditation) but i cannot seem to make any of them actual habits.  it’s hard to take on new habits alone, with almost no community and little discretionary income to invest in myself.from reading and listening to lots of books (on attachment, psychology, self-help, mindfulness, etc) i have been left with the overriding feeling that addressing my problems starts with developing good habits.  that if i only improve my character by developing better mental toughness then i will no longer live my traumas over and over again, and i’ll be able to use self-discipline to move on and contextualize my past so i can thrive in the present and future.  my therapist sees encouraging signs in our sessions, but my psychiatrist is very concerned at my plunging scores on depression and anxiety screenings, and is consistently urging me to consider upping meds, returning to old prescriptions or trying new ones.  the self-help books in my head say, “stop making excuses.  do the work.  you are better than your internal critic.”   and i so want to believe that i am capable of that--after all i am not the only one in pain, or the only one with hard circumstances. i recognize my privilege. i have had so many opportunities in my life that i feel like a whiner for even posting this.  but i am so sad.  so joyless.  so lonely.  and i don’t trust myself to help me out of this--but i don’t trust meds even more!\*\*tldr; i’m aging, lonely, heartbroken and broke.  and although ive taught myself a lot about how people deal with these problems and become sober, i am struggling to develop any good habits to help me out of this.  i want to stay off of meds so i can feel my feelings and grow, and although i feel like i can see how that would look, i often feel paralyzed or unable to consistently practice the habits to get there.  do i take more meds and compromise my awareness of reality?  and suffer side-effects that seem unacceptable?  or persevere through the pain, to take on the demons?  how can i just keep at this and trust myself--despite the persistent lack of faith i feel in myself?   can anyone who has been in a similar place relate to this and share what worked in your experiences?\*\*&#x200b;it’s like i was in a terrible accident and i have realized i can leave the car but i can’t stop looking at all the

adccir,relapsed last night after a year of being clean...,selfharm,"i been dealing with depression, anxiety, and self harm for a while, but it felt as though i kicked my sh habit, mostly replacing it with weed. however, the fogginess in my brain that weed gives me is causing me to fall behind in college, so for 2019 i decided to give up smoking. my (ex)girlfriend of 5 months also broke up with me in mid december, and that hurt a lot.**background:**her and i met in the fall of 2017 in our first semester of college. we lived in the same dorm and quickly bonded over similar music taste. we became best friends and she even gave me a stick and poke tattoo of the sagittarius symbol, my astrology sign, on my thigh. to me, that tattoo was a symbol of how happy i was at college, unbeknownst to me, the elation would only last for that semester...we began hooking up for a week or two and then abruptly stopped, but the friendship was still strong. it stayed that way for about year, until this summer, when we both confessed our love for each other. she was my first love, but despite that, she still caused me pain. over the five months of dating, she broke up with me twice, the second one being the final time.... so far... she has started hinting at maybe picking things back up upon return from winter break.this has been a complicated time for me and my emotions have been all over the place. i have been actively working to combat my depression and ive been seeing great improvements, but ive also had to fend off very close counters with taking my own life (last night being one of those, which i will get to at the bottom if youd rather skip to that). i hadnt cut myself since finals of fall 2017 and i had been working on creating a more rigid daily routine, which was boosting my outlook on life. on all levels, i want her back. i still love her. why wouldnt i? i didnt want things to end, she was the one who broke up with me. however, i also know shes not good for me. during our most recent break up i reach insane levels of instability and irrationality. these feelings were brought on by a specific incident; when she came to my dorm room, drunk at 3am one night in december.  this was a couple days after she had broken up with me. she had ended things because she questioning everything and didnt feel like she was in the right place. she wanted to work on herself. however, these feelings were not long-lasting and the very next morning she texted me, telling me she had made a mistake. i held my ground and told her id consider restarting the relationship, but not until after we had some time away from each other to think. we still kept in semi-frequent contact. things were cordial, but not flirtatious in anyway. **one of the worst nights of my life:**the night she had come over, she had texted me saying she has a few more things she wants to say and would like to come over to my dorm room. i didnt respond until about 8 or 9 pm saying, ""sure, come over."" she didnt respond until about 2am, asking if it was still okay to come over. i  was sober and naively said yes, because it was a weekday and i wasnt expecting her to be drunk.she shows up around 2:30/3:00 am, and i can tell she has drank, which she admitted to. she was being very flirtatious and trying to make some moves (wanting to sit in my lap, etc.). i declined and told her it would be best if she would go home, and then offered to drive her back to her dorm, as i was sober. halfway into the car ride she begins sobbing, explaining how shitty she feels. i begin to console her, but at this time, i was aware that it was not in my interest to take her back, despite every neuron in my brain telling me to do so. it wasnt long before i was sobbing uncontrollably, to a point where she stopped crying, realizing how fucked up of a situation she put me in. we sat outside her dorm in my car for like 15 minutes, all the while im crying. she eventually leaves, but i dont stop crying. through my tears i start to drive back to my dorm, and, despite her absence, my mental state continue to deteriorate. had it not been for my 1.5+ years of training with my therapist i am confident i would have drove my car into a pole. but i was able to recognize my downward spiral and put a stop to it. i park the car and walked the rest of the way to my dorm. this was by far my most unstable night.she apologized the next morning, but i was never able to get over how inconsiderate she was of my feelings, mostly because she is aware of my mental state. even knowing that she acted the way she did.**last night:**last night was entirely my fault, i got really drunk and consequently, depressed. for the past month, ive been tripping myself up over this tattoo she gave me, a constant reminder of her. i hit a breaking point and just wanted it gone. i dismantled one of my razor heads as i had done before and went to work disfiguring the small tattoo on my thigh. the cuts ranged in depth, one in particular is deep, but none are serious enough to cause concern. i cant count how many i did, probably 15-20 on the tattoo itself. but that wasnt enough for drunk me... after i was satisfied with my work on the tattoo, i carved ""fuck you"" adjacent to the slashed tattoo. i remember cutting my thigh, but i dont remember who the you was referring to, me or her. i have a feeling it was me. i wrote it upside-down on my thigh, so its legible from my perspective, but upside-down from an outsiders perspective. and i cant imagine saying ""fuck you"" to her, i still fucking love her man...i feel pretty shitty about relapsing... i was making such great strides and i really didnt see this coming. and besides, now im gonna have to explain to future girls why ""fuck you"" is carved next to a slashed tattoo on my thigh.if you read this, thank you. i just needed to get this off my chest. im not giving up on making my life better, but god dammit this shit is hard.if anyone wants to chat, ill probably be active for the rest of the night. i just finished my 4th beer, but im done after this. we dont dont even have to chat about this, i got some gnarly music recommendations and ill be playing old school runescape all night.",2019-01-07 03:16:59,Iiwets,1

adagh7,concrete defense walls (trigger warning),depression,"almost every day i feel like im drowning from loneliness.  in high school i had a very dependent, toxic, on-off long distance relationship which set my standards extremely high for the level of mental intimacy i need in a ""real"" relationship.  were still friends but not on the same level.  during the same time period, there were two guys who were dating each other and almost every day (for however long it was) they would kiss and lick and touch me and talk about how they wanted me in a threesome, and both of them assaulted me privately on separate occassions which is when i started to understand what was going on.  for most of high school (for tons and tons of reasons) i was either blacked out or dissociating.  if i was in an uncomfortable situation (i.e. being sexually harassed) i wouldnt mentally realize what was happening, but i would laugh nervously and my body would try and wiggle out/push away.  only a week later would i see what had happened.  on top of that, i may have been molested as a child, or at least exposed to explicit media which created fake memories and made me believe id been molested.these are the thoughts ive been obsessing over when i think about why im so lonely.  how i cant connect with anyone on any level, touching in the smallest ways activates my fight or flight mode, and even seeing pda makes me sick.  it feels like im never going to break these walls down.  i want to put myself out there, make more friends.  be intimate with others.  feel fulfilled.  depression and aspergers makes it difficult on top of trauma.  my interests are narrow, my behaviour is stunted, my hygiene/self care is worse than desirable.  im just scared.  scared that ill never break my walls down and be alone forever.  scared of what someone else will do if i get close.  scared that i wont find anyone even if i can try.  my medicine is working well but i gave up on therapy and i feel like theres nothing else i can do to get help.new years resolution: grab fear by the balls and find locals to hang out with.",2019-01-07 00:03:35,zbdb13,1

980dxp,i don't remember the last time things were this okay,depression,"title is kind of a lie- i was having a pretty okay time back in the summer of 2016, but i dont think that counts because i was drinking and doing a lot of drugs which started a year-long psychotic episode.my last psychotic episode ended on july 16th after a failed suicide attempt.  since then, i finished filing for disability and ive been focusing on my art and started selling things on ebay.  dont get me wrong, though.  i only have two friends who i dont talk to much right now and so almost every night im incredibly lonely to the point of crying, and ive been getting angry a lot lately, and my parents got a new dog that scares me, and im cutting myself at least once a week...but its okay.  because the first time since 2012, i am thinking about my future.  yes, i still get upset and suicidal often but im looking forward to the future and i dont want to die anymore.  i actually was legitimately excited for two days for the first time in such a long time, and i hated it.  i had those sickening butterflies because i was so excited, constantly thinking about 2-3 years from now when i get accepted for disability and im consistently selling things on ebay and etsy and i get to sell my art at art fairs and i get to decorate my house as ugly as i want to and live by myself with my own rules and i wont have to live with the mess that four other people make in the kitchen that gives me paranoia about contamination.ive been stubborn and waited for years.  ive rejected all medicine because i hate the side effects or i just dont feel like taking it.  ive accepted that its my choice to not get better, and ive been at the whim of my suicidal delusions and fucked up hormones since i was 15 years old, maybe younger.  and now im here.  my brain was so exhausted that it numbed out all my feelings of wanting to die.  my delusions have been nearly invisible for almost a month.  i cant be certain that this okay mindset is going to last even through the weekend, but its here now and i think that matters for something.i stopped caring about myself a long time ago, and i still dont.   several weeks ago i would think to myself that i wish i was still suicidal because it gave me hope that there was an end to things at some point in the future.  i said ""if my brain and hormones want me to be suicidal, then i will be.  if they want me to feel decent, then i will be.  but i couldnt care less about making an effort myself to be one way or the other.""and now my brain wants me to feel decent.  i did nothing, and i succeeded.  i cant make any prediction how this war will end, but i won this mid-year battle.  after typing this post, i actually feel fucking fantastic.  right now its just hit me that i am here, i am truly okay for the first time in my life, and even if i still have mood swings, im fucking winning right now.  i never would have expected that i would have been able to feel this way just two years ago, or two months ago.  im a fucking winner.",2018-08-17 10:51:50,zbdb13,1

ad8sxy,"i got in a fight with my parents on my 21st birthday, and left the restaurant.",depression,"i don’t really know what i’m trying to achieve by posting here, but i’ve been dealing with depression since i started to be bullied as a little kid, which was also about the time my parents got divorced. i never had any real friends until my third year in high school. by then things were fine for a while, i had friends, bullies were leaving me alone, and for the most part i was happy. but i never wanted to be home. nor even mentally present. i just wanted to hang out with my friends, or get stoned and check out into my own little bubble. after high school i took three semesters at college. i made two friends, but later had a rough falling out. they weren’t the kind of friends that would stick by you, nothing like my friends from high school. by my third semester i was living alone, i had no friends within 200 miles, i wasn’t studying, and i was very suicidal. i decided to drop out and move into my dads apt to work for a year. which was a year ago from now. my dad and i have our differences, but we see the world through the same lenses. had i not left, i genuinely believe i would be dead now. my parents got divorced years earlier, and it had torn our family apart. my older brother was never around, because he was constantly trying to escape. he has since moved out of state, effectively terminating any friendship we could have created had we spent time together. my two sisters hated my dad because they thought he was an evil catholic republican, and ignored him whenever it wasn’t convenient enough to pay him any attention. they had no empathy for everything that he lost in the divorce, his daughters love included. when i started forming my own opinions on politics and philosophy, i aligned a lot with my dad and brothers conservative beliefs. after i came out to my mother, step father, and sisters that i was a libertarian, and would not vote for hillary, they immediately saw me as an enemy. i was unclean, bigoted, fascist, racist and evil. worst of all i believed in christianity. they hate me. my sisters at least hate me. it’s extremely difficult to maintain a civil atmosphere with them, one politically incorrect misstep and they make no hesitation to throw boulders from their tower of virtue. and of course i shoot back pointing out the fallacies they spit left and right. nothing gets done, and de-escalation is nearly impossible. amazingly the most zealous hater of conservatives is my stepdad. who i love a lot, but have become so indifferent towards in the past few years. thats the thing, indifferent. i don’t hate my family, but i don’t think i love them any more. i don’t want to be around them anymore. its just stressful, and i feel like its constantly a battle, and i’m always outnumbered and cornered. taking shots from everyone left and right. its not like we’re able to have debates or even discussions. its just a shouting match with an extremely short fuse. anyways, i turned 21 yesterday. i went out to a restaurant with my mother, step father, and my girlfriend. who’s relationship with me is more of a ‘it’s complicated’ definition. i’m the only conservative one at the table, and somehow things become political. all of a sudden i’m in this defense mode, almost like i was spiked with adrenalin. nothing was fun anymore, nothing was happy, and i certainly didn’t want to be there. at some point i felt extremely cornered, and things had gotten so out of hand and unmanageable that i couldn’t take it. i left the restaurant. i probably took three bites out of my meal and wasted it. i barely touched my beer which was the entire point of the evening. i just wanted out of the situation, and i wanted the day to end, and i wanted to forget anything ever happened.now i feel like i did a year ago. i’ve never talked to anyone about this stuff, even when i went to a therapist as a little kid, i still lied to him about how i really felt. i don’t know what i want from this. i just feel so exhausted and beaten down. i wish i could just start my life over from the beginning. do absolutely everything differently. i don’t know where i am, or where i’m going. but i feel so indifferent to my family, and i feel like i’m on my last leg. i just don’t know what to do.(a quick note, i’m not getting into a political discussion here. thats not the point of this post, i just want to explain the deep rooted divide between one half of my family’s morals, to the others. please don’t say anything political)",2019-01-06 21:25:15,SymonSezzz,0

ad87tu,considering quitting ssri's...,depression,"hey guys. ive had depression and anxiety my whole life. it runs in my family and unfortunately i inherited it. ive tried all sorts of anti-depressants over the years with only minor success. but about 8 years ago when i was going through a particularly bad phase with my anxiety and depression, i was prescribed 3 medications: 200mg of sertraline, .5mg of clonazapem 3x a day, and 1mg of risperdone 2x a day.the risperdone is supposed to be helpful for obsessive thoughts at low doses, and i must say that it has helped me immensely in that regard. the benzo, well... its a benzo and it works lol. its helped greatly with my anxiety.but as for the ssri, it also seems to help with my anxiety, but not really my depression. in fact, ive come to realize that over the past 8 years, ive been going further and further into depression. but maybe not in a classical sense, its more of having no emotions at all and feeling like i care about nothing.ive gained a lot of weight, become increasingly anti-social (i basically never leave my house expect for work and essentials), and stopped caring about all the things i once loved. put it this way, im a guitar player since age 11. i took lessons for many years and even went to college for music. today, i dont even own a guitar. i sold them to pay bills when i was unemployed a few years and havent had any interest in playing again. it seems strange that such a huge part of my life doesnt seem to matter anymore to me.so basically, my anxiety has gotten much better, but my depression has gotten much worse. i realize there is no magic pill and theres a lot of factors that can cause depression, but after trying so many different ssris and never really having true success, im starting to feel that their doing more bad than good. ive read that they can make you emotionally ""numb"", and thats how i feel, and have felt for many years now.has anyone felt better off of ssris or other similar medications? what are your experiences? im considering going down by 50mgs every two weeks and see how i feel. thoughts?",2019-01-06 20:30:59,BAN666,1
ad7zyo,depression allowed me to observe the grim reality we sometimes live in,depression,"let me start off by saying that i recognize that theres good in this world, and that there are good people, theres no arguing against that because ive seen it and i experienced it and some humans are just gems. i also realize that im depressed and this will affect my outlook on life, but i will try to give you the raw picture as it is.i have certain characteristics that are, generally speaking, not appealing to most people. ive experienced it ever since i was a kid. i clearly remember certain occasions where people would pamper and speak to other children but ignore me, and growing up, i always got bullied at school (because of my looks and background) and this affected me heavily because i still feel to this moment that most of my cynical emotions and behaviors come because of the emotional stress that i felt back then over a period of 8 years. over the next few years, i took a lot of risks in life that just worked amazingly for me, so i thought that yeah, things do get better eventually. but during this period, i was also under stress because i was doing it all alone, doing the climb alone without hearing much encouragements or support.i didnt let that affect my grades nor my vision for the future, because i always thought that in life things just tend to get better, or problems just tend to disappear, which is true, but i remember that certain unlikable characteristics might appear more as negatives to most people than positives, in the end we are just biological creatures and our brains like to think in patterns. which led me to be very skeptic of religion and eventually i started having existential crises that are stuck with me to this day, and theres this one, very dark thought that lingers in my mind and that makes me scared of reality. the thought is that life is harsh and brutal, theres no ultimate justice, if you have certain unappealing characteristics that other perceive as unlikable, then naturally you will get left out and not be special in other peoples eyes, its just the way nature is. if somebody treats you bad today and tomorrow and after tomorrow, it doesnt mean that you might have a good day in the future or a good tomorrow just because shit happened to you, and i think religion really affected how i viewed this, and the moment i left it just all made sense.the word ""eventually"" is disappearing from my book, because i always had that hope you know, that i might get to know people eventually, that i might fall in love eventually, that i might have someone who supports me eventually, but im now pretty sure that wont happen unless because of some random chance that i meet someone or some people out of the 7 and a half billion people on earth, which im starting to lose interest in. i know there are a lot of people like me out there and yes, we might meet someday and share an amazing life or friendship, but the more people i meet the less trustful i become, the more cynical i want to be. do i really want to expose myself to all people and waste time and energy so that maybe, just maybe they happen to be good people?people befriend me so that i could help them, this has happened on so many occasions that ive become really doubtful of peoples motives, and even though every now and then i get a good person in my life, they eventually either turn out to be fakes or they go in another direction in life. i have become really cynical, and im loving it and hating it at the same time. on one side of the coin, im now more relaxed because i dont give a fuck about people anymore, whereas before i would try my best to present the best image of myself because... hope. on the other side im lonely as fuck but content that people wont hurt me anymore. i mean the only person that i think loved me unconditionally and really saw through me was my mom but now shes gone.this eventually led me to the following question: why risk getting someone into my life when i know that theres a big chance that later on i will need to get over them? (which takes a lot of energy and time on my part, which is basically wasted time)i keep seeing the bad in people, i know theres good, i swear i do, i even know there are amazing folks out there, but the rest are just kind of... i dont know..this is leading me to become a lot more cynical, which further worsens the case for me. at the same time, i dont want to take risks with people, because im the type of person who prefers deep and meaningful relationships with one or two people rather than having 10 friends that i know little about or dont catch up with often.""life is tough you should just grow up"" is bullshit and should rephrased into ""most people are shit and you need to learn how to deal with them"".",2019-01-06 20:09:18,GreatWizardOfSverige,1

6qe7mo,yielding to others gets you left behind,depression,"im a pretty high functioning depressive. im 30 years old and have been dealing with mental illness since i was 13. that being said, the depression can hit hard if i fight it for too long. i dont expect anyone to read this but im hurting and need an outlet. ""are you ok?"" becomes a constant question for me. the real answer is ""no, im constantly battling myself to stay above water"" but the answer i give is ""oh yea, ill be fine. i always am""so i yield to others who in my logic at the time have more pressing problems. but after doing that so many times ive given the impression to my family that i dont need them. that i dont need their help. and i feel left behind. i do need them. i need time with my mother to move passed the grudges i hold against her for the way she behaved during my childhood and teenage years. i want to leave that in the past and make new memories. but every time i try, something else demands her attention. so i yield. shes currently making new memories with my childhood friends and their children. (its a close not group). i wont give her a grandchild so shes enjoying their children. shes not mad at me about that btwi just feel forgotten and left behind. one day she will be dead and ill hold the grudge that she never made time to grow with me. i dont want to ruin her good time with others to let her know that i feel shes abandoning our relationship. shell feel guilty the whole time ive been isolated by being the ""downer"" before and i dont want that to happen again. but ive been isolated anyway by not articulating my needs. so here i am, in bed and confused on how i dont hurt others and at the same time preserve myself.  i just want to be a good person. but i dont want to be forgotten.

this whole time i thought i felt bad because i realized i needed to get my shit together, but thats not it. i felt i needed to keep my grades up in order to keep mom from figuring out my mistake of not doing my work. thats what this all is. thats what i have been feeling this whole time, i have never been motivated by myself to do well in school, oh fuck i cant believe this. fuckkkkkkkkkkkk. im dead, thats it, im dead inside. no motivation, and people know it. i have no reason to do this. thats what has been happening this whole time. i even said that i wished i was older so that i could say “i want to go to school”. wow. im going to bed, little homework completed, no project finished before the final deadline. i started this a few minutes after 9:00 pm, now its 9:52 pm. good night couple days later: 8:51. i bought a new nerf gun today. i thought it was a good idea at the time, but when i got home, i felt like i had wasted my money, even though it was only 10 dollars and it was really neat. i played with it for a while, trying to convince myself it was a good choice. eventually i broke down and shot myself in the head with it two times. it didn’t hurt as bad as you’d think, but it did sting.today was awful. at school, i felt that i slipped from class to class like ice until the end of the day. i have a test tomorrow and i feel ready for it, but a small project is due in health tomorrow. there is also a writing task due at midnight today, and i feel so bad that i feel i cant do it. maybe i’ll procrastinate it away by writing this, that ill forget all about and end up not doing it. not tonight. tonight ima motha fukin do my shit for once. tonight i won’t put it off and do that stupid “what homework?” thing in class. but maybe i will. maybe i won’t go to school tomorrow, maybe i can’t . fuck!back, 7:54 pm march 1st. i’ve had some weird shit going on with my head. i can’t focus, and when i can gather the brain power to find out why, some weird shit pops up. i saw a medieval style tapestry in my head, and it was a drawing of a frog, reaching over a ledge with his left hand and holding a dagger in his right hand. ?wtf? i feel like i’ve been trippin the last 3 days at school and before i go to bed. tonight we bring the dosage back up (zoloft). mar 20 well fuck. that didn’t work. i feel like i’m at the lowest point again, and i don’t want to talk to my mom about it. like i said before, the only motivation i have to work is not having to lie to mom. now i have to tell the dirty truth about my 3rd quarter grades. it’s like i have to fight a battle with the enemy, and lose for no long term benefit. :(.  i’m trying too, but it’s not working out. i just can’t, i have 3 ds and 1 f, with 3 weeks left in the quarter. 1 a tho, but thats freshman spanish. i’m a sophomore. :((.  fuk. i don’t have any homework done and it’s 10:05. i have to take a shower and go to bed. no morning study hall. have to complete weekend review for math on the bus and in the 20 mins before school starts. :(((((. d: i might hate myself… when i cry, or feel hurt, my back shivers in soreness. fukin brilliant. i wish i could talk to someone. i want to tell my friend, but i’d be too embarrassed. i want a girlfriend i could tell how i feel. i wish i had a shoulder to lay my head against. i wanna girl with a short -skirt and -a loooooooooong… jacket. :/. ………7:38 pm april first 2017im feeling really great with my new medication… april fools!i feel like shit. i might actually want to kill myself now, it’s a part of me now. i want to die so much. i did wrestling today, and it was great, but i just can’t deal with the rest of the day. i want to die. i want to cry, and worst of all, i want to be in enough pain to give me another reason to kill myself. :( if i don’t sit here pretending to do work she will make me talk about it, and i don’t want to. i have the best life anyone could ever ask for, but i suck too much. i hate myself. pls help :(march 8th, 2017 3:30-3:45 pmthis past year has been a reflection on my life. i have gone back in time, wondering what i should’ve and shouldn’t have said. cultures believed it was a god in the end who would look into their souls and give the verdict. but i think that we judge ourselves. i have weighed and judged myself. i way a bit, but i am not the best. hundreds of thousands of dollars have been used to keep me alive. i feel like i am not good enough for this, but i feel like i cannot kill myself because i would’ve wasted all of that money, that money that is the reason that our business is having trouble. i cannot kill myself, i want to, but i know i would just be more of a disappointment. i instead cry and tell myself i want to die. and i really do want to die. my grades aren’t terrible. they are salvageable, but i am not. my mom thinks i’m failing all my classes, and i’m not, but i’m close. she doesn’t want me to go to summer school, but honestly, i might have a better time learning the material there. i kind of want to go to summer school. but it costs money. i feel so emo, haha. maybe it helps. maybe it’s just a fashion. maybe it could make me worse. maybe i could be like i am at home at school. either way, i seriously am considering suicide. 4/17/2017i am going to tie a paracord noose. 5/31/17so i havent been around for a while. i got a lot better, till history class today. just cant.  i dug a hole too deep for me to get out of. i can only stay. the bedrock beneath and around me is impenetrable, and above me rain slowly seeps in. i will drown. i fucked up. i fucked everything up. should i kill myself now, or make myself suffer? i have sentenced myself to a life of misery. tonight i decide. i was supposed to ask someone out for the first time in my life today. i forgot all about it. i forgot my subway date money too. oh well. it would have been a nice shield from the negativity seeping out of my grades. maybe if i did get her number, i would have felt purpose. i’m so fucked. i’m crying at school. oh jeezus christ. i think i might die today. imagine how fucked up people would think i am if they saw all this shit. oh my god i would be in an asylum. that’s probably where i belong. and if i ever got that crazy, i would ask for a mercy killing. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand my mom knows about my grades. if there is a time, now would be great. ffffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk  mom just decided to stay home. i. need. to. be. alone. tl;dr: instant gratification often makes people look for short summaries rather than reading a larger paper.",2017-05-31 23:18:55,Oct8Agon,0

92r0x9,how i defeated depression,Anxiety,"keeping it direct and simple:   1. depression is a cycle:   it is literally a cycle of thoughts that you go over in your mind, again and again, not letting yourself let go of these toxic thoughts. i came to this realization through therapy and decided to distract myself from every last thought. you have to be able to catch yourself doing it, recognize it and get rid of the thought by emptying your mind by meditation or a healthy distraction. my distraction was math. i started doing math from algebra all over again and now i am taking calc 2. i self taught myself something, just to distract myself and ended up enjoying it. its also my go to thing for when i am upset, i know what state of mind i need to be in, to enjoy my subject.   2. change everything:  i changed everything about myself. i out down the weed and video games, i cut off toxic friends and even toxic family. it was hard to do but i did it, and returned to college, and held a part time job down for a short while till college picked up after meeting my math requisites. develop into a better person in all respects. go jogging, exercise, and study something. improve your knowledge and yourself, giving yourself a fresh start. 3. catch the toxic thoughts:i already mentioned this, but really it is important to do. we go over problems in our minds over and over again because the brain is naturally trying to deduce a solution. sometimes the best solution is to walk away from the toxicity. learn to leave it in the toilet and mentally flush that shit away!4. be patient:  breaking out of depression takes time, and it will happen. you will notice it. you will love it and you can do it. i was a miserable sack of shit. love your life. your life is meaningful and has value. your ancestors went through millions of years of evolution, so that you could live your life. own it. one day at a time. a new you will surface. a better, stronger, more awesome you than ever before.   good luck! i was there, and a recent anxiety attacked made me want to share. take care and be strong!

ad33dr,my depression roller-coaster made me think of self harming and so i vent it out!,depression,"so, ive been a depressive guy for god knows how long, only about 5 years ago i decided to go to a therapist and see what was going on. i was feeling highly frustrated and unmotivated yet i wanted to feel better, before that time i had graduated high school, had worked for the christmas season and started studying architecture in january (though it lasted for a few weeks until i dropped out), and was feeling lost and weird, feeling nothing actually i was just going through the days. i should add that my father also influenced my depression, i had that perfect dad image of him even though he was mostly absent because he was always working, always away; until one day my sister and i found out he was cheating on my mom, we decided to confront him about it and i ended up knowing he used to be married with kids before being with my mom and that nobody ever told me until that moment. so my dad cheating on mom, him keeping a secret from me for my whole life made the image i had of my father completely shatter up the point of losing respect for him.now, i live in venezuela and venezuelan and i think latin culture overall has a huge serious taboo about mental health, nobody speaks of it and it consumes a lot of peoples lives, mine included. one day i chose to tell my parents how depression was killing me and it was like talking to a wall, the next day it was like i never even spoke to them.anyways, one day i decided to go to a psychologist and was it the best choice i could ever make, she helped me get back on my feet, go to culinary school, get a job at a restaurant, so i got cocky and stopped going with her, huge mistake. a lot of crazy stuff happened that i wont bother you talking about .fast forward to today, january 6th, 2am. i am 22 years old, struggling with depression again, living in a completely wrecked and hopeless country, where theres no opportunity for the young people who want to have decent life, a place which will break you up completely, strip you of your will to push through, to fight, a place where a months work is worth less than 10$, a merciless place. here i am feeling as frustrated as ive ever been, trying as hard as i can to move to a better place and have a non-mediocre life, but unable to get the money to do so.yesterday i had the unconscious thought of getting my razor sharp paring knife and cutting my leg. its scary to have that thought, its scary how your own mind can betray you into doing something you would never think of consciously. though i cant deny suicide is always an idle thought. sorry if this is too over the place, i have a lot of things on my mind and wanted to vent something out, maybe someone will relate, maybe not. but if you read all this, youre great, youre awesome and youre worth your weight on gold, youre the best person in this planet and dont let anyone make you doubt it.

ad0mdv,"so many reasons to live, so little patience to give.",depression,"i want to die but theres so much to live for: my cats, my best friend, my mom, and the fact that theres so many places ive never visited in this world. yet, even when i could count all the reasons i should stay alive, i know im just better off dead. after all, what would it mean to me if i did travel the world? its just a distraction. or a gesture of awe directed at the grandiosity of earth. as for grief, it passes. people get over it, just like dust particles fading into the breeze on a stagnant day. the memory of you diminishes until it blurs out completely. & im okay with that. (or am i?)my field of vision is narrowing down when i think of the future. things are making less sense by the second, and my constant battle with perfectionism and the realization that no one amounts to anything gnaws at every dying breath i take. its a scary thought: coming to terms with all that is absurd in this life, yet so effective it is; after all, im one sigh away from considering a way out. everything loses its meaning, all that i feel is transient, and everything is a never-ending spiral of nothingness. my cats give me a sense of purpose in such an aimless life i lead. theyre the only creatures i care for; the only creatures whose presence will forever alleviate my lingering solitude. but animals leave you too, you know–an even scarier thought. i find myself worrying about a future that ceases to exist in my imagination. if i ignore that, i find myself dwelling on the past instead. just give me a fucking break. im held hostage by self-doubt and self-hatred; they define my binary thoughts. theyre the evil twins who dont give me the chance to enjoy what i have.my good days are determined by the intensity of my existential dread, which is why i cant remember the last time i have enjoyed a day without my thoughts ruining it. its a loophole, you see. but the trembling constant lies in the absence of a willpower. where is that, you ask? overshadowed by insecurities & all my other toxic traits. thats normal. everyone possesses toxic traits, but not everyone finds themselves utterly helpless in the hands of abstract concepts whose sole purpose is to destroy what is left of you.the fact still remains: im troubled, listless, and depressed, but i fear death more than anything. i fear the afterlife, i fear the unknown; the eternal nothingness; the endless possibilities awaiting me on the other side. its an even scarier thought to leave this world with nothing behind. to be lost & forgotten to the people you love the most. to amount to nothing again. but theres something oddly satisfying about vanishing into this bottomless pit that is called death. you return to the warm hold of lifes very mother: nothingness. ah yes, thats something we should all seek comfort in: the fact that we were born from a void, & return to it, we shall.  as much as death seems pleasing to me—as much as im in a constant search for a backdoor out of this, the pain i experience in life is cherished gravely in my heart, and no suicide would ever take that away from me.

9pu1oz,is this behavioral pattern normal? i'm really struggling with an obsessive personality,mentalhealth,"how likely is this to happen to a normal person? ive had obsessive behaviours all my life, such as phases of obsessions with things and people. however, i feel like, the older i get, the worse it is. i can find an interest (be it a hobby, an activity, a person, a movie, a band, etc) and obsess over it for months then lose interest in it almost instantly (in one or two days). i know its normal to change and people cant stay the same forever. i know its normal to grow apart from things. but i feel like theres no consistency in my personality at all, i feel like i could just lose everything ive ever loved in the blink of an eye. for instance, when i was little, i used to love a tv show (this was approximately 11 years ago) and now i found it on youtube and started rewatching it and obsessing over it - which is absolutely bizarre because the show is aimed at a relatively young audience (kids) and im 21 now. i know this will pass but i just find it very odd how i can just become obsessed or lose interest all of a sudden, for no reason at all. a few months ago i used to be obsessed with a band. i loved them and would listen to them 24/7, to the point where i was actually ignoring my personal hygiene and responsibilities because i was too busy listening to my favorite band. turns out all it took was 2 days for me to become completely uninterested in that band, for no reason. now i cant even enjoy their music on a normal level anymore. i dont know why this is happening but it makes me feel weird. also, i kinda feel bad for becoming obsessed with things and then dropping them like they never meant anything to me - because i become attached to them and when i lose interest, i find it incredibly hard to cope because i can no longer enjoy that special something that has previously occupied all my time and energy. when i become obsessed with a person its literally hell on earth. it takes me years to get over them.&nbsp;i just wish i could enjoy things on a normal level instead of suddenly being obsessed and then dropping things like they never even existed. right now im going through a really shitty time because im not currently obsessed with anything and i miss the high of being infatuated. im literally having both physical and mental withdrawal symptoms such as intense, debiliating anxiety, clinical depression, nausea and all kinds of random pains in my body.does this happen to anyone else and do you have any advice on how i should cope?",2018-10-20 16:15:33,ImaKillMyselfTonight,1
8rqxbg,difficulty finding a good therapist that can diagnose me,mentalhealth,"**sorry for the wall of text, im literally desperate**im 21 years old, female. for the past 3 years, my mental health has been in a constant state of decline. at first, my symptoms werent so intense and scary (mainly anxiety, fatigue, depressive episodes, anhedonia, etc). however, they quickly started to take a toll on my life so i started to see a therapist. i felt misunderstood (she was often overlooking my symptoms, thinking that im making them up, telling me to be ""positive"" etc) so i looked for a psychiatrist and a new therapist. the cycle of seeking new therapists and psychiatrists continued, because neither helped so i thought i needed to look until i find someone who can diagnose me properly. for the past 10-11 months, however, ive been starting to feel legitimately insane and it seems like not even professionals can get a hold on my situation. i dont know whether this is my anxiety acting up, but i feel like im starting to develop schizophrenia. i know reddit cant diagnose me, but i just feel like writing this post because i am really worried and i feel like no one understands.&nbsp;the first thing that made me genuinely worried is the **detachment** that i feel all the time. sometimes i feel so detached and unreal that i can no longer recognize voices and faces - they all look strange and unfamiliar to me. sometimes i cant really associate peoples voices with their identity, and even my own voice sounds unfamiliar while im speaking. i cant recognize my own reflection in the mirror and i cannot connect emotionally to my memories and identity, i feel like a stranger in my own body. i feel like my ego has died. my current therapist told me that i might be suffering from depersonalization/derealization, which i agree with to some degree, but i feel like theres something more.another symptom which worries me is the fact that i often cant distinguish between what is **real** from what is not. sometimes i have **imaginary** arguments with people that i know, and despite the fact that i do realize theyre just in my head, my gut feeling keeps telling me that theyre really true and that everything is real. i can hold grudges on people who have done nothing wrong to me just because something in my head told me that these people have hurt me. for instance, one day i imagined that my mother tried to kill me and even though i knew it was just in my head, i still grew resentful toward her in real life (she never actually tried to hurt me).most of the time, i feel completely isolated. i dont have friends. i feel like i dont resonate with anyone. as a result, i often create realtionships in my head, and most of them are with **celebrities**. for the past few months, i have been having daily conversations with a deceased actor. everything he says or does, in my head, reflects what i feel towards my realtionship with him. i drink my coffee with him, i sleep with him, and every time i need to make an important decision, i ask for his opinion. its a platonic relationship, but i feel profound attachment towards him and all my life is being dictated by what ""he says"" in my head. some days i can completely hate him because i create weird scenarios in my head about how he killed someone or tried to murder me in my sleep, and then it takes a whole week or so until i reconcile with him. ive had such voices including people i did not personally know in the past too, but they werent so intense and disturbing as they are now...right now, i feel like my entire life is being controlled by this presence that i can feel but i cant see. and this presence is something thats permanently with me.&nbsp;overall, i just feel terribly isolated and unable to feel grounded. i feel like im living in my own imagination rather than in real life. i feel like im living in a simulation. sometimes im not hungry or thirsty or i refuse to sleep because my thoughts are acting up. i cant connect with reality at all: nothing is interesting or enjoyable anymore because i genuinely cant experience reality. nothig is actually **real** anymore, i can only experience my own version of reality, which is often distorted and weird and unenjoyable.&nbsp;i really need help. the mental health professionals in my area havent got a clue whats wrong with me. most of them have told me that ""im too young to be suffering from schizophrenia"" and that i seem pretty ""rational"" to them. but despite this, none were able to diagnose me and prescribe me the right treatment and i feel like, whatever i might be suffering from, its going to kill me soon. i cant take it anymore.what do you think about my situation? what should i do?

acyw7y,dear 2019,depression,"  dear 2018,after graduating, i decided that i wanted to go through higher education for my parents, despite me barely graduating high-school and not really wanting to do further studies. i was luckily accepted into a pretty good university in london that required higher grades than mine and had the chance to move in into my uncles apartment. i loved london, had a job, had a bursary, was into university. but i was not content with myself. i’ve never had a passion for something, further studies don’t necessarily interest me, and the only thing that i thrive for is to have a successful career. looking around me, i found passionate people that had goals, and that grinded hard to get through university. i expected to meet way more people, but have not had many opportunities to meet people, especially as i don’t drink alcohol and don’t have many points of interests. in 2018, i wanted to explore london and take more care of me. i had the chance to have friends come over twice and showing them the city felt so good. i discovered some of my favorite restaurants and had some of the best food in my life. i had my first solo travel experience outside of my usual family gatherings and went to amsterdam. spending the money was hard as it has always been an issue for me, but i loved wandering alone in the streets and trying random stuff.in 2018, i discovered i was depressive and bi-polar, just like my mother. this hurt me quite a lot, especially as i already have adhd and how it impacts me everyday. i had some of the biggest mood swings i’ve ever had in my life and had some very high moments and very low moments, which made me feel even worse overall. i found myself crying when i had no reason to do so and had no one to comfort me. i tried to be there for my friend’s mental health and discovered some of their issues. i did my best to comfort and it helped me so much to know that at least they had me to talk about those kinds of things.in 2018, i secured a year long internship with a very big company. being unhappy with the content of my degree, i was incredibly scared that i would not get a job without prior experience after graduation and stressed so hard getting a summer internship in 2017. i failed but used all of what i learned in 2018 and secured a placement very early on. the phone call might have been the best moment in my life. and whilst i failed at the last stage of recruitment of some very prestigious companies, that paid as much as 3 times of what my father has ever earned, i kept going and discovered that one of the only thing that i wanted in my life was achievable, especially as a kid that has lived his whole life in social housing, state schools, with a dad on minimum wage and a mother on disability.in 2018, i wanted to meet more people. i haven’t had the chance to meet a lot of people, and some people have either not entered my life or left it very quickly. it however never hurt me. in 2018, i wanted to die. letting that sink in was a hard task. i found myself, alone, in my room, wanting to die. and despite having sarcastically joked about it for shits and giggles, the process of becoming conscious that you want to die was life changing to me. i found myself bored, and alone, whilst being abroad with new responsibilities. &#x200b;dear 2019,i want to push myself further, do more sports, meet more people, but what i want the most is to get help. i am conscious of the implication of my mental health’s state but have always felt like i had self-control and that i didn’t need therapy. whilst i know that this is probably silly to anyone reading, i am just throwing this out here in hope that i could look back at this if i ever hit my goals.to a good 2019 to all of you, and hopefully me.",2019-01-06 00:08:08,someonesnewaccount,1

74iofe,been thrown back to a dark place..,depression,"ive been suffering with depression for years now.. and today just made history in my extremely low waves..i recently got a motorcycle.. and things picked up, it provided me with freedom, a sense of living, and allowed me to  simply buggar off anywhere when i get stressed out.today i had my first (minor) crash as a new rider and it was basically my fault. im ok.. physically - just a bruised rib or something.. at the time i was overwhelmed with panick, and emotion. i stood outside panicked in the cold for about 3 hours getting through to people, letting work know i wouldnt be in, and getting my bike looked at. i was shaken. recurringly throughout the day ive had the same 3 hours-ish replay through my head, and ive grown to simply hate myself today.. going through phases of ""shit happens, youll get this sorted"" all the way through to ""youre stupid, youre useless, why the fuck did you think you could accomplish something for once and maintain happiness for a change?"".all day spent holding that knot in my throat back, from 8am through to 9pm (at the time of this post).. and i just broke down, and needless to say today has been the lowest ive ever been (i find myself saying that each breakdown i have, and yet i believe it to be true... i guess thats my sign that im getting worse). its funny how the world continues to function as though nothing changed.. had i been going faster, i could be in a much worse state.. and yet, the traffic moves on and people go about their days as they normally would... colleagues doing their jobs having casual chats at the workplace.. whilst i go through what i consider to be close to hell today. to think - if id have died today, it really wouldnt have changed anything. maybe it wouldve been for the better (i hate myself more every time i say this.. because i start obsessing over how it would affect my siblings/close family).. im a sufferer-in-silence.. theres not many people that know of my mental illness.. as im sure theres a lot of you (if anyone is even bothering to read this) that are in the same boat.. not wanting to burden people with yourself. tinder. a temporary distraction from my current state of mind as i seemlessly swipe through what could be and couldnt be.. the potential for an end to lonliness (not everyone views these things as a one nighter hook up app, internet). but when it comes to it.. theres nothing there. its just that - a distraction.. and it wears off to.. i come back to the realisation that this lonliness wont end. and theres no one that would want me.i have to decide whether im capable of working tomorrow.. capable being - trying to focus my mind all day on actual work and not get anything done anyway.. or not going to work after all this and get nothing done anway. same outcome, different route..what is the fucking point.. its amazing how easily the stress this morning was enough to throw me back into one of these states.. back to my dark place.. when you let that knot loose from your throat and start to cry and break down - its so fucking hard to stop...i could ramble on all night.. but really, who cares? i dont even know if i care.. i feel like nothing but an empty hollow shell..tl;dr - had a decent few weeks, had a motorcycle accident, and have been thrown back into the depths of the dark place that is depression.. not that anyone cares.",2017-10-05 23:21:49,VanityR,0

9ukogn,my brain feels like it is on autopilot.,mentalhealth,"i feel like im losing my mind.pretty much all the time my brain feels like its on autopilot. its like im just in the back of my head while my brain and body are doing the work for me. i spend most of my time in deep thought/zoning out rather than notice what is going on around me and not on purpose. when i am not in deep thought/zoning out i usually feel totally out of it and like i am not processing anything well at all. the only mild relief i get is when i play video games or watch tv shows, but even that is starting to fade away since i am having problems understanding and following simple plot and conversations in them without having to think immensely hard to understand it. my head feels like it has pressure or is numb a lot as well. i am completely confused why this is happening to me. i dont do drugs, i barely drink alcohol, i have had an mri that was totally normal, and i have had blood tests that come up normal as well, except a slightly elevated bilirubin (gilberts syndrome).i recently graduated high school and i am waiting to get into college this january. i have tried applying for jobs in the meantime, but i havent had any luck so far. since this is the case, i havent been doing much other than stay at home and be on the computer all day. i would do something else, but i dont have any irl friends or any hobbies other than watching tv and playing video games.i recently have been sleeping way more than usual. around 12 hours a day if not more, but i have cut that back and sleep only around 9 hours. i used to eat only one meal a day which was dinner, but i have also started eating throughout the day instead.i am currently going to a therapist to try to fix some problems i am having involving my memory and i have been eating more frequently and sleeping less (like i said in the last paragraph) due to his recommendations. he currently doesnt know the problems i am facing other than my memory issues. i do plan to tell him on my next visit with him.i am writing this just to release some frustration and in hopes that someone could have some insight to why this is happening to me. if one of you is experiencing the same kind of thing, i am hoping you could tell me what you do to try to make it better.i probably should have said this earlier, but i have had ocd ever since i was little, but throughout the years of taking prozac it isnt really that much of an issue in my life anymore. i also am not depressed, but when i look up my symptoms it says that could be the cause.i wrote this on the fly so pardon any grammar or typing mistakes i may have made. i also really appreciate any help any of you are willing to give. thank you.",2018-11-06 05:14:26,Anxiety-Monster,1
acu66d,anyone else feel their environment makes them depressed?,depression,"anyone else feel like the area they live in is depressing? my mom has clinical depression and anxiety. she barely does anything around the house as it makes her tired. she’s been through chemo so maybe that’s why but that still doesn’t change the fact that maybe she should change her diet or something to make her more proactive. anyways. why am i talking about my mom? i grew up with a single mother in section 8. she’s been through a divorce. thought she found someone better but he was psychologically abusive. had my little brother, he became developmentally delayed. stepdad keeps coming in and out of our lives. i can never maintain a job because that would increase our rent by 35% and my parents would be like “you have to stop. working isn’t worth it” the real thing that depresses me is how can i go for my masters program when the program i’m in right now is so expensive that i’d have to work full time. i’ve never done full time before. what if my grades don’t go well? why am i saying all this? i feel like everything i’ve been through made me become a depressed numb person. i don’t know what it feels like to be normal. heck, i left my last retail job after the first day because it didn’t “feel right”. i want to go out of state. i want to take a trip to the west coast. i asked my mom what does she think if i looked for a university elsewhere besides the tri state or east coast. she said she doesn’t want me to go there. her usual responses are : “that’s too far” “that’s too hot” “you should stay close to family” “we live in a convenient area, there’s no reason to move” then i usually say: “why don’t you come with me? get out of this depressing area.” tl:dr - i feel like my family and environment makes me depressed and anxious. i apologise if i bounced around topics and it doesn’t make sense. that’s literally a representation of my thought process.

7h6kut,i'm so pathetic that i can't kill myself because of finals lmao,SuicideWatch,"i want so badly to end it right now. my problem is that if i fuck it up, ill spend a couple days in the hospital, and then have to face my regular life again minus the time i couldve used to study. its pathetic. finals are in a few days and if im stuck in the hospital i wont have time to study so ill fail and fuck my life up even more than it already is. its so hard knowing that if i fail a class it could literally determine my future. that sounds dramatic but i have some specific circumstances that basically mean if i do poorly this semester ill be unable to go to school ever again. and my dream career requires university.i feel like ive tried so hard this semester, ive studied hard despite the depression, ive learned everything i could and felt confident about my knowledge and then the professors all throw curveballs on the midterms meaning i do poorly. 3 of my classes have extremely low averages because of these curveballs but i guess the profs are fine knowing theyre harming (or ruining in my case) the futures of their students by doing this shit. im just so tired. i have so many people who need me. my life is objectively very good but i never feel good or happy. i feel numb, but at the same time i feel this need to just end it. i dont want to feel numb. i want to feel nothing. i want to be dead.i attempted suicide before and failed and i wish i wouldve died that day.i dont think im cut out for life. if i cant even handle the stress of school, how am i going to go to work every single day for 8 hours? i feel like the only way i could live is to be a neet but im not happy doing that. i spent a year in that life because of my depression and it was horrible.i dont think theres anyway i could ever be happy.does anyone else feel like this?",2017-12-03 02:49:18,AnustartBoys,1

6m0jza,on passion,depression,"[essentially posting this for myself as a journal entry. i know its long as hell.]im not feeling particularly low right now but im not feeling good or content either. if emotions are a wave then right now im in neither a crest nor a trough. my line looks pretty horizontal actually and i dont really know which direction will come next.there seem to be alot of posts recently about people wanting to find their passion. i totally understand this desire. however, it seems like they believe that it would make life easy to have one. (same thing with relationships but thats another story altogether...) my experience has been the opposite.i always knew what i wanted to do with my life. since i was about 10 or 11. its difficult to have discovered your passion so young (or at all, i believe). its funny how certainty can breed frustration in that way. everything else has changed entirely - even my very body and mind - except for that one thing.it can be comforting at times, for sure. sometimes when im surrounded by turmoil it can be nice to listen to the songs i loved when i was young. its effectively just like stepping in a time machine and travelling back there but without having to deal with all the painful parts of the past.im grateful for that indeed, but as i said, its hard having a constant thread in life. its exhausting and very often disappointing. being passionate about something (or some*one* for that matter) makes you really vulnerable to being hurt. im not just referring to criticism, be it internal or external... its like being naked and exposed in a way. its as if you have no way of covering up or protecting yourself because that would be to erase the fact that you are passionate. its kinda like the end of the trial - pink floyd. having a passion or enthusiasm for something is like the judge and the crowd yelling ""tear down the wall! tear down the wall!"" but all of it being completely silent and only inside your own head.now obviously this will sound like a complete exaggeration to most. im aware of that. i dont know if this is something unique to the modern world or if it always existed, but i feel like people who care alot about one thing are alienated. youre supposed to be well balanced in your interests and if not then youre just ""weird"". nobody likes to hear about one thing for any length of time or think about it deeply. after a certain point its ""enough now"" and onwards to the next thing. and i just get the impression that everyone is always skipping the track right before the really good part starts!but anyway, it doesnt really matter what others think or say. most passionate people are their own worst critics. even if you were in a room full of people praising you, it would still be possible to feel like a failure. fulfillment can only ever come from within and its a bloody difficult thing to achieve.i know that the only way to do that is to accept what you have and what you are. gratitude is also helpful, not just for the blessing but for the obstacles too. but why is it so hard to be supportive of and encouraging to myself? it comes so easily towards others, what makes me different?i know that thats a pretty standard experience in depressed people. i have made alot of progress in encouraging myself in other areas of life. however when it comes to my main interest i still struggle to feel adequate and worthy.i think one of the main reasons is that most people often put their younger selves down and dismiss who they used to be. theyre too afraid to empathise with their past selves. instead they call them naïve, immature or just plain stupid. but i dont do that. not anymore at least. i can laugh at my younger self, definitely! but i never belittle, insult or demean my past selves. theyre still a part of me after all. back then i did the best i could with what i knew at the time and i have to respect that.i feel really good when i notice something that would make my younger self feel proud. each time that i accomplish something that i only ever dreamed of doing before, it just fills my heart right up. :) thats why i trust the instincts i had as a kid. after all i did, amongst some other things, have fantastic taste in music for a 13 year old.if that little girl could meet me as i am now, i reckon shed think im pretty cool. that means alot to me. all the thoughts and feelings in my head right now would make no sense to her whatsoever. shed definitely love my tattoo as well. i definitely feel a sense of responsibility to make her proud because i had a really difficult, really shitty childhood. my depression also started when i was 13.so yeah, i guess i just have to try and remember this stuff. its hard but its important. everything happens in its own time and for a reason unbeknownst to us. whether im feeling up or down changes my perspective of things, but it doesnt change those things themselves.i will feel that sense of accomplishment and pride again. its guaranteed and i couldnt prevent it even if i tried. the work i do is as natural as breathing. sure, i hold my breath a little sometimes... but then it continues. ad infinitum.the other things in my life dont matter one bit - disrespectful people, excessive socialising, mistreatment by loved ones - none of that matters at all. the only thing that ever mattered to me and ever will is that i continue doing what i love most.",2017-07-08 14:45:54,hermitcait,1

acs52i,what are ways to feel happy after visiting family for a long time?,depression,"i don’t know if this is the right place to post, and i don’t think i necessarily have depression but, i just got home from phoenix, arizona and this basically happens every time i come from there. i have so much fun, surrounded by all my friends and family for a week or 2 twice a year. once i come home it hits me hard. i feel very sad and lonely. i don’t know if this happens to everyone but it does to me. i think it’s worst this time because we came home to a circuit being blown and destroyed from the outside plug on the side of the house (there was a bad storm before we got here). so i have no wifi to play games with my friends (which usually takes the thoughts off my mind and let’s me chill out a bit) and it really pissed me off, especially since now i have to wait for the circuit to be fixed tomorrow, and i’ll have only one day to be able to enjoy some games with friends and be able to play with my cousins on fortnite. i say i have only one day becuase after this weekend i start back school which makes me even more sad and pissed off at the same time. i fucking hate it where i live since i don’t know many people here who have the same interest as me and i’m not the most social person. i’m planning on moving to phoenix when i go to college to get out of this shithole city. it’s not all bad but i just don’t like the weather and atmosphere, and the other people that live here as well. sorry for the rant, my dad won’t understand what i’m talking about and i just need to get this stuff off of me and hopefully someone will reply to this lol. it’s like whenever i go out of town i change sort of. once i come home i realize how boring my damn life is and i don’t really notice it because i am so used to it. i think all i need is some more friends and people that take more interest in my hobbies. i need to be more social. i guess i’ll just go to bed soon and hope that tomorrow will be a lot better. i just miss my family and being able to talk to a lot of people back there.

8na9wq,i'm sick of hearing about people talking up exercise/being outside as a cure.,depression,"when i exercise too hard, it saps my bodys energy. it makes me feel sweaty and gross. it makes my muscles sore. that physical pain and weakness are not great for my mental health. it stresses me out when i feel like i cant breathe like i did yesterday when i walked about 8,000 steps in very high heat and high humidity. i dont get where the magical depression cure is in pushing myself through a blanket of water droplets for over an hour. im pretty sensitive to heat being so fair-skinned, so i scoff obviously whenever memes or the internet generally seems to act like ""going outside"" is a cure. i feel better when im inside and in a temperature-controlled shelter. does that make me weak or a bad person? maybe some people beat their depressions or blues by going outside and sweating it out. but i just feel fucking drained and suicidal after most intense sessions. a little walk on a nice day is fine. but also, its tied to pill-shaming. in that, people who shame others for their use of anti-depressants act like the obvious replacement for them is some combination of sunlight, exercise, healthy eating, adequate sleep, and socializing. and while all those things are obviously important, they are not anti-depressants. stop acting like you know more about brain chemistry than a neuroscientist or psychiatrist. kthanx. also this article agrees with me: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/exercise-isnt-a-cure-all-for-mental-health-problems-for-me-it-led-to-self-destruction-a6895106.html ",2018-05-30 20:05:45,rachaellefler,1

5tvsng,any tips for finding jobs and interviewing?,depression,"the thing about interviews is, you have to smile and make eye contact. the job will go to the person who can muster the most bubbly corporate enthusiasm and smile like that stupid enzyte commercial dude. theres no getting around it. on the applications they ask me to say im white, female, and not a veteran and i give them irrelevant details like where i went to college and where i worked and when and so on but they dont have a box for me to give whats actually the most important thing for me to say: i have chronic depression/dysthymia and if hired, a breakdown day, week, or even month-long episode could happen at any moment, is beyond my control, and would seriously impact my job. most low-level positions take this ""show up at 8am peppy and not tired and revved up and cheerful and polite or insta-fired"" look where youre disposable so you have to be perfect at all times. what i really want to do is to find a job with a more relaxed, flexible atmosphere and some kind of company thats depression-friendly. maybe i should try a non-profit or religious organization, even though im not religious or super political? i dont expect to be paid for not working but i do want to be able to take time off when depressed and still have a job to come back to when im not. and i dont like the limitations of self-expression and expectations of fake cheerfulness and phony politeness ingrained in corporate culture. anyone here found a way out of that? i do blogging at home but i make like $10 a month at that so its not exactly a job, but i would like something to work from home at.

7fcwgf,getting it all out,offmychest,"[long post]this is a long post, so bear that in mind.ive been holding this in for a really long time. the last time i got what was wrong in my head out was in my teens. im in my early 30s now. im not normal. i know it. my friends know it. my family knows it. i suffer from a deep dark depression that worsens a little bit every day. i feel a tangible pit of despair in my head that never goes away. ever. there are days when i can get through it without wanting to throw myself into oncoming traffic. then there are days when i contemplate how much better off i would be if the pain just stopped. i am an army veteran. i never saw combat but i do suffer from ptsd. i am claustrophobic. i have nerve damage. i get anxiety attacks. i have diminished sensation in my hands. i have arthritis in my spine. i have lost brothers to cancer, prison, and drugs. my best friend in the world suffers daily from the shit he was told to endure in iraq. i suffer in my mind. i am a prisoner stuck in a cell with no way out and no reprieve. i emotionally eat. i attempt to fill a void that can never be filled. the only thing that brings me solace is writing, reading, photography, bike riding, and video games. those things quiet my mind to a point of almost blissfulness. i wish there was something to quiet or dull the pain. my worst toothache does not approach the levels of torment i endure. i just needed to finally get that all off my chest. if someone reads this, maybe i can hope for something better. maybe...i can find peace.[update]i woke up this morning and for the first time, the weight on my heart and mind was lessened. not entirely gone, but severely lessened. i didnt feel like i was on the verge of a constant and near mental break. i smiled. and i didnt feel like i wanted to jump out a window for doing that. thank you to those that responded. thank you for caring. it meant more than you can ever know.

acq3c2,am i broken?,depression,"i think im not normal and honestly screwed. im a 27 year old guy no dating experience, no sex exp and this year i set a goal of becoming more outgoing maybe actually meeting a girl or just making friends as i dont really have any, just one casual old work buddy that i see every month or so for breakfast.i consider myself a social person and actually do try to make small talk with random people gym attendant, cashiers, my co-workers. so today i went into a store i frequently go to and made some small talk with this cute girl who i always talk to when i go through her checkout line. she actually gave me her number which is a first for me but she is 19 and i even mentioned that im older and shes too young for me but she sort of shrugged it off and i took her number to be polite and as a nice confidence boost. dont plan on pursuing even though she seems like a nice girl but just too young i think plus she seems to have some drama.anyway later in the day after going to the gym i said to myself fuck it do something you never do, get out of your comfort zone go out to eat, go to a bar. i never do this alone because i feel awkward being the solo person eating somewhere. i ended up going to a sports bar to get something to eat. it was ridiculously loud and i felt uncomfortable, ate my food and towards the end this older woman 40s started making some small talk about the sports game on the tv, mentions her kids. just quick chit chat but in my head im thinking is this woman sort of talking to me this weird stranger as if shes interested, made me more uncomfortable since i wouldnt even know what to do in that situation. so after finishing my food i pay leave tell the woman have a good night. as i drove home i kept thinking am i broken. dont like being at a social place like a bar, girl gives me number earlier and im surprised and caught off guard. i just kept thinking youre a fucking loser and should kill yourself. been depressed for a long time since i hate my life but i have been trying to improve my life and confidence but it feels like every small step i make forward i take a few steps back and get reminded that im a loser, broken, freak whatever you want to call it.sorry for the long post.",2019-01-05 05:11:32,wishihadaps4,1
acpy7r,i need help because i feel constantly guilty for being who i am,depression,"originally i posted this on a separate subreddit but i was preeeetty much ignored. decided to try this forum even though it has little to do with my depression and more just my values in life.i feel immensely guilty, as a guy, for being attracted to women. i feel like the pain of being objectified is stronger than anything i’ve ever felt, and it’s something i panic about any time i even talk to a female classmate of mine. i feel so fucking disgusting whenever i masturbate, but i do it because ejaculating is one of the only things that makes me feel happy anymore. i fear no one will ever like me because i hate the idea of having children... of not only putting a woman in labor pains but also in putting another child on such a cruel world and inevitably fucking up parts of his/her life. it feels like such a selfish thing to do. i don’t know what to do guys... i’m really just insanely unhappy with the idea that our lives seem to run on sex, i feel isolated because i don’t want to have sex but rather just stick with having a close relationship and cuddling and kissing and shit, caring about each other idk. i... i don’t know what to do because i feel like i’m feeling so guilty about something no one else even seems to care about. what do i even do? how do i even develop a relationship when i don’t even know if the other person only wants sex or not... i feel like people see me as disabled or something. am i just man-guilting myself too much or trying to justify asexual/antinatal morals? do most women care or not if i want to have sex with them...? i feel like if i even look at a girl and appreciate her beauty i’m being objectifying and i can’t help it because my stupid brain just thinks like that. it’s like the way a woman is built or dresses up or whatever seems like art to me, but i hate the idea of that because they’re people and i want to care about them like people. i think it’s good to be aware and try to limit myself from objectifying women but i just live in constant fear that it’s gonna make me lonely and useless. will the world always just love sex and am i destined to be alone and confused by my surroundings?",2019-01-05 04:54:30,BeardlessReviews,1
a37ii0,i don’t really know what to feel guys,depression,"an exploration of where i am right now, which i feel is not even urgent but i don’t even know where i’m going tbh:1. i really am not in that much pain. i look at other people and i see people who are suffering a lot more than me. hell, i’m in a better place now than i was a few years ago for sure. but somehow that just makes it more confusing.2. i’m constantly in minor pain. my chest, my throat, my head, my stomach... something is always numb or bugging me. i don’t take pain meds because of all the negative shit i’ve read about them. i don’t do recreational drugs or alcohol besides my two antidepressant prescriptions that i kinda feel are just placebos tbh. one of them doesn’t even have any taste to it whatsoever. 3. there’s no lesions or anything discovered in my brain, so it feels like my depression isn’t even validated. i don’t think there would be any difference if they discovered a lesion, but idk man i just somehow feel even more like in a permanently liminal state or something.4. i’m unique in the way i talk but i still can’t really get good relationships going. the only people i’m in relationships with are those like my family members who speak mandarin who don’t really understand how i’m trying to make myself unique. otherwise, i’ll occasionally get a nice comment telling me it was nice talking to me and i’ll feel good for a moment but i really wish i could find a good relationship. i mean i try to be as honest and intimate as possible.5. i feel alone in almost everything i want to do. no one of my peers chases after new music or old films or competitive gaming as much as i do, so my own hobbies feel empty. i can find some people over the internet but i still feel lonely.6. i’m happiest when i’m sleeping, but also i’m super stressed because my dreams are pretty crazy. i will constantly be in like dreamception where i wake up into another dream, live an entire day, and then realize it was another dream all along. furthermore, my dreams have so many more intimate relationships and exciting adventures than my real life, which feels very boring and pointless. i’ll sleep a lot, maybe more than a dozen hours on every bad day which is almost every day these days, and my schedule kinda permits it... to ignore my minor pain and because i’m bored. i’ll even try to push things back just so i can sleep more. i wish i could re-experience my dreams somehow, i really miss some of the relationships i built in some of them.7. i’m kinda on the brink of failing classes just for not attending enough classes or not going to enough extra credit stuff (otherwise i do well on my exams and papers), and it feels very claustrophobic. obviously i should’ve planned ahead and not let it get to this point, but i just feel really awful certain days and have to call in sick. or i’ll completely forget about doing something. but in the end i still pass the classes, so i end up feeling like it doesn’t matter even though i kinda does. so like i end up feeling this nausea of being in intense situations where i need to make sure i have no room for error, and that will push me through to the end, but then i never learn from that i guess. or i feel like i need the extra time. and even though school is nice and offers you help for depression, it’s still uncomfortable. 8. the only burst of happiness i get is that chemical release you get when you cum after masturbating. but because i’m asexual i actually have a lot of trouble ejaculating so oftentimes i’ll just feel like a complete idiot and be sweating and getting numb before just giving up. 9. i feel like there’s so much mundane shit we have to do every day: eating the same tasteless food, sitting through people talking to you, etc. and it just makes me feel so bored. i end up skipping so much of it because it feels so draining. but then it always comes back and makes me regret it somehow.10. there’s so much minor pain in my body that either has no physical explanation when i get to the doctor or is just supposed to be like normal. and it’s maddening sometimes.11. it’s just like this for what seems like forever and ever. and then when it’s better it’s not like it’s that much better i guess. it just doesn’t feel as awful.12. i’ve got little motivation to do anything.right now my biggest hope is to get into super smash bros. ultimate competitively, which will hopefully be easier with the joy-cons on the switch. i’m in my last week of finals and really struggling to push my way through.",2018-12-05 03:54:22,BeardlessReviews,1

acoivz,"had a bad anxiety attack, and decided to write about it to make me feel better.",depression,"i hate the month of january. the high you get from the happiness of the holiday season wears off, and you’re forced to deal with the harsh realities that the new year brings. i don’t make “new year’s resolutions” or try to make every new year the “best year of my life”. the best year of my life will happen when it is meant to happen. i am not going to try to force unrealistic expectations into my year - i know i will only be setting myself up for disappointment. why do we hold on to unrealistic expectations if we know they’ll only lead us into the inevitable pit of despair we call reality? for some people, unrealistic expectations are the only reason we get out of bed in the morning. life is pure shit, but we keep a firm grasp onto this idea, this hope, that one day, you’ll will wake up, and life will be dramatically different. life will be fun and worth living and you won’t spend every waking moment anxious about the future. but after so many rejected internship applications, after so many failed auditions, after so many flunked exams, after so many months of trying to lose that body fat but maintaining the same dreadful weight, after being ghosted by so many people that you poured your heart out too, after another failed attempt at a meaningful relationship with another human being, you lose your grip. many of us have unrealistic expectations when we first meet someone, especially if that certain someone is attractive. in our head, we imagine ourselves falling in love with them, having a meaningful relationship, getting married and having children. but more often than not, we never see this person again, or never talk to them again, or if we do, they end up no being the person we expected them to be. this is why i try to proceed with extreme caution when someone shows interest in me. but more often than not, i fall, and i fall hard - and the unrealistic expectations take over. why? because i want to feel something, and feel loved-everyone wants to feel loved. it is a feeling like no other. but who am i to talk about feelings-when i am devoid of any type of feeling 93% of the time. i let this person into my life, which, of course, leads to the inevitable act of intercourse. and then-just as quickly as it happened-they leave. and these unrealistic expectations fade into oblivion. i feel like a fool for believing he would ever want anything more than my body. then, a few months later, someone new comes around, and the toxic cycle begins again.unrealistic expectations can be used to escape our own mundane lives, or avoid feelings. the feeling of loneliness is arguably one of the worst feelings in the world. the feeling that no one cares. time and time again family members or friends tell you that they “will always be there for you” or “will always be there to support you through your darkest times”. but during your darkest times, the times when you feel the most alone, they always seem to prove themselves wrong.why am i being so pessimistic? why am i being so dark? i’m always told if i was more “optimistic” i would be happier. fucking bullshit. maybe it is because i was born with a chemical imbalance in my brain, or maybe i have been fucked over one too many times by the wrong person-but i can’t afford to be optimistic. i can’t afford to have unrealistic expectations or goals. when i’m asked “what’s wrong” and i attempt to put my feelings into words, i am told “life could be worse”. shit, i know my life could be worse. i could be living outside in an oversized cardboard amazon box for fuck’s sake. being told “life could be worse”, when my feelings that i try so hard to put into words are invalidated, it only makes me feel worse. and you wonder why i push people away.late december and early january are, arguably, the worst times to browse social media. (granted, any day or time of the week is a bad time to be on social media. it is nothing more than a facade of who we think we are. who we want others to believe we truly are. but that is a whole other conversation in itself.) people share photos from their “amazing” year-photos from a frat party on halloweekend, bikini shots from their march break in bermuda, and tranquil landscape photos from their study abroad trip in england. (i swear, people spend a few months in a european country and it becomes apart of their personality. i mean, i’m like that too, except my personality stems from my long weekend in a psych ward in 2016). why isn’t my life like that? why are people living the life i should be living? since elementary school, i had this expectation of how my life would be-attending a college in california, where i would make tons of friends, maybe go on a study abroad trip, find myself a boyfriend, get a career out of college, get married, live happily ever after. that’s how life seems to be going for a lot of people i know. but not me. my life has been far from that. anyway, here’s to a new year, and all the fuckery that will inevitably come with it.

9pwi8b,interesting tidbit i read about hyper-arousal vs. hypo-arousal in ptsd. thoughts?,mentalhealth,"""hyper and hypo arousal in ptsdthe common conception of ptsd from movies, magazine stories, and other social media is that it involves forms of hyperarousal such as memory intrusions, flashbacks, hypervigilant scanning for reminders of the trauma, excessive startle response, irritability, violent rage, and insomnia due to nightmares, anxiety or agitation. hyperarousal is tied to living in or intermittently diving back into what boon, steele, and van der hart (2011) call “trauma time” in their book coping with trauma-related dissociation. in truth major traumatization gives rise to symptoms of hyperarousal and hypoarousal (boon, steele, & van der hart, 2011). hypoarousal is characteristic of dissociative disorders and ptsd. hypoarousal is associated with the freeze response in mammal mediated by the dorsal vagus nerve when they face a threat to life which they cannot avoid by fighting or fleeing. hypoarousal is manifested by features like amnesia, emotional and/or physical numbing, depersonalization (feeling estranged from oneself), and derealization (feeling as if the environment is unreal or dreamlike). hypoarousal makes it difficult or even impossible to experience feelings of love, pleasure or interest. hypoarousal exists in major depression as the wet blanket that makes the sufferer indifferent to love, friendship, and opportunities for play, amusement or entertainment. however the diagnosis of depression emphasizes the presence of great sadness, dark mood, recurrent thoughts of death, and so on, while the diagnosis of ptsd does not. ptsd is more a disorder of memory, physiology, and interpersonal behavior while depression is primarily a disorder of mood that influences cognition and functions like eating, sleeping, sexual activity, and movement. the neurophysiological key to understanding ptsd is that one and the same sufferer will show hyperarousal when living in or reminded of trauma time and hypoarousal (freeze) as a means of avoiding a return to the trauma memories that feel as if they are happening now. hyperarousal and hypoarousal are both unconscious, protective responses to trauma that lie at opposite poles of the ptsd continuum. just as a person with bipolar i disorder can shift back and forth from mania to depression a person with ptsd can switch back and forth between hyper and hypo arousal.""has anyone noticed that there is often a lot more focus placed on hyperarousal than hypoarousal?",2018-10-20 21:30:44,Nummoth,0

9c7ex4,i don't know anymore what to do in life,offmychest,"i am not happy unfortunately. and i have been abusing weed and other obsessive things as a way to cope with that. i also seem to have a deeply ingrained sense of being a piece of shit and in my brain theres a constant chatter of everything that has went wrong or will go wrong.​i see a pattern. but when i go ahead to ask myself ""okay, if not that, if not being a piece of shit then what"". and my brain gives me no answers and i wait for a long time for an answer really. but none come forth.​what to do in life? i have a decent job which i dont particularly love but its fun i guess. im slipping in terms of money, promotions, status compared to my current peers but im good at the level i am and im also slowly, in my own way growing. i have been taking care of all my dependents for a long time and i guess i can just stop here and keep doing this for the rest of my life. what im trying to say is that, people who work with me are more motivated than me but they dont seem to be more efficient than me. it makes me feel spiritual at least once a day.​work. get high. sleep. and collect a fat cheque. its not the best life in a lot of ways. i feel very depressed. but what else is there in life? im always alone, i was alone for so long that now i dont even try to go out. i also think that i need to put a lot of work into myself. but in a way, i do put a lot of work. i read voraciously, i journal, i try to express all of these feelings in my music.​i dont really know what the problem with me is but im not happy. i just want the day and life to pass as quickly as it can. there is nothing to do in life besides just one activity after next. it could be weed but when weed is not there, i keep asking myself ""well, what else is there to do in life? i wont be anything or anybody important and my responsibilities are being discharged perfectly. im hurting nobody. so why not just smoke weed"". and again and again i keep failing also. im very tired of asking for help also but i really just wanted to vent it out.&#x200b;i honestly just wanted to be accepted and loved. i know its my fault and the world owes me nothing but  i was very sad at my failure. i dated people and it didnt work out. and now ive been single for years and i dont even know anymore. if theres one answer that what would i want to do then it would be to feel more accepted, and more comfortable. and maybe being not alone for so long.",2018-09-02 01:58:38,kartokovitz,1
8z8lek,i feel so unlovable,depression,"and i really am crying here for someone to love me. i know nobody owes me love and deep down, i know that this kind of attitude is not healthy at all. but its been so long since i have had any companionship. im probably doing something wrong or maybe something is wrong with the way i approach people. i text people all day long on okcupid but not even one replies back. i dont know, im not even that unattractive but then i feel like im not that attractive either.something must be fundamentally wrong with me. i dont know what to do. but this part of my life really depresses me when people say that the right one will come along. because days just pass by and very soon they turn into years and nothing really changes. i hug my pillow so tight every night, i imagine waking up next to someone or cuddling.im so tempted to say ""fuck you"" or something just so that someone at least makes me an object of their scorn. so that i get some attention. i just hold myself back because why blame someone for their dating preferences. shallow, not shallow, it doesnt matter. these people have their own set of demons to fight. im so surprised when i hear that people have had sex in cars or people actually hookup. i sometimes get number but these people.....never mind. they are just people and i have nothing against them. its also my bad luck because the small minority of people who do like me are always moving out of the city or going on a break or something. its okay however. i have all the empathy in this world for them.please tell me what to do? im more than happy sharing my pictures and my text messages and everything and id love some feedback. i dont know how do you approach anybody in real life. im not that cool. and i have asked people for feedback on my online profiles so many times. i know that there is probably a way but i have tried a little bit.i feel bad for myself because i dont think that anybody deserves to go through life thinking that they are unlovable and a piece of shit but also at the same time, having these quantitative data points to prove that yeah, they indeed are unlovable and are a piece of shit. nobody deserves to feel so low about themselves. i have turned so salty because of all this and im not a salty person. im tired now. there are so many things i want to say about my romantic life but im so tired writing this.good night.",2018-07-16 09:23:28,kartokovitz,1

8jwlxj,last week i was not fine. this week i am.,offmychest,"i am okay now. im actually in a better place in life now. i dont have any long term plan because my long term plan depended on being with that person i was sad and wrote so many reddit posts about. but i have a lot of short term plans.essentially im a lot more genuine. i realized how much my friends love me and i couldnt be the asshole i tell myself that i am to have such awesome friends. i know it should be simple to like oneself but its honestly not. for example, i have a slight bald patch at my crown and that makes me want to kill myself. i dont know why but i feel like no girl will like me for being so imperfect. and i cant fucking fix my hair. maybe i can do a hair transplant but i am also not motivated enough to fix it since essentially i feel like i am a piece of shit.but im much more genuine. i have learnt to accept my self-hatred and kind of become friends with it. i have learnt to express it in my drawings, in my music and in my poetry or even posts like this on reddit. i realize what the point of art, the highest and the best thing one can do with the art is. its simply self-expression. and all the shit that i give myself in my head comes out beautifully in the form of a good metaphor or a diminished chord or an extremely ambiguous and chaotic chord progression. art is kind of saving my life. so thats all i had to say. last few weeks were crazy for me. and i couldnt really find a way to say things to people so i ended up writing all of it on this subreddit. im doing fine now so i was compelled to write this post.thank you. and good. nice. i wish you all the best. itll be fine.",2018-05-16 20:06:37,kartokovitz,1

8hpdvq,i feel enslaved and liberated at the same time.,offmychest,"i believed so strongly in the relationship that i ignored all the warning signs. and in the morning i woke up very sad, then i fell asleep and i got even more sad in my dreams. then i told myself ""itll be fine kartokovitz. itll be fine. just give yourself time. to breathe. seek help and support.""i have been overwhelmed by friends. i always believed that my friends hate me but they absolutely love me as a person. my friends lulled me to sleep. even people i knew very little about told me to ping them or message them if i feel worried. im very worried. all my life, i have tried to run away from myself. i feel so unlovable that having a relationship is an absolute must for me. i dated her for three years but she fell in love with someone else. i dont blame her or hate her for her choice. but i believed in her more than i believed in myself. my whole life was based on her life and now that she has fallen out, i dont even know what to look forward to. i feel very brave thats true. i became better at guitar because i just believed i had nothing to lose, a bad note, a dissonant chord. uncertain beat and time, its all fine. then i opened my mouth to sing and i cant even believe that i cant sing. my voice has dropped an octave or two and i sound james-blunt-ish. the pain is too much for me. i will have to completely reinvent my life. and i dont know where to start. i have been lying myself for so long that everythings okay. just smoke some weed and maybe jack-off. i lost all interest in weed and cigarettes and porn. i lost all interest in eating. i dont know how it will ever get better or if it will even get better. i dont know if ill ever find love. i dont know if ill ever be happy. i dont know what future holds, the past held a comfortable depression. i fought it with meditation and running and weed and journalling. but something was missing always. and when she left me, all these things started staring right at my face.i cannot escape from myself anymore. i run as hard as i can but it comes back. i keep running stories in my head that i will say this to her or that to her or i will tell her how much i am hurt and out of pity she will give me another chance. but i know its over, she is happy with someone else. she is not coming back. and even writing these words make me hurt. i will never ever do this to myself again. i will never run away from my heart again. all the philosophy and existentialism and buddhism is all bullshit. its just some fancy words to cushion oneself. i have placed so many band-aids around my life and all of them are falling apart. i dont know what i will do. i feel brave. i feel strong. but at the same time i also feel scared. i feel sad but i also feel genuinely euphorically happy. im getting comfortable with the truth and its very painful. to accept that i really had no plan, that i am so fucking insecure, that i dont eve enjoy weed, i just do it to numb myself. its very painful but im finding it impossible to make stories. i dont know what ill do in my life. from here on, im free and i dont know which way to run.",2018-05-07 20:43:08,kartokovitz,1
8hj6tm,i'm writing a long letter to my ex. i literally need to get this off my chest. would love some reassurance.,offmychest,"hi n,i know you are in love now. im not at all happy about it but i think you are happy. to be honest, im very jealous, very hurt and very vulnerable right now. i dont know how and when the misery will end. i closed my eyes and i asked myself ""pretend that you had all the love in this world. what else would you like to do"". i couldnt answer the question. it looks like being in love is all i want from my life. so now imagine how much i loved you, how badly i wanted to marry you. how i saw you as a daughter, a mother, a friend and a lover at the same time. now take it all away and give that to someone else. thats how i feel.im hungry but im not able to eat. im sleepy but i cant sleep. i dont even want to drink because even that is not working. nothings working. nothing at all. i went to see my therapist, i got better for ten minutes but then i got worse. why did you have to ask me how i was doing? i ended up texting you and i ended up seeing your profile picture and your whatsapp status. i started running around in the room like crazy, i told myself to calm down but it didnt work. and then when i said im in a lot of pain because of you and you said dont put it on me. fair enough. and then you blocked me when i asked you to talk to me. fair enough. then why did you ask me how i was in the first fucking place? did you really care about me? then why did you say that i cant talk because im sleepy? i am not mad at you for breaking up. that brings sadness which i will talk about in due time. but i hate your fucking excuses. im in a bus. im eating. im pooping. well, you know what? im fucking dying. i get to be tended first. you can miss an hour of sleep for someone who helped you so much in life. and this is not even after break-up. why? like why? have i ever shouted at you? why avoid confrontation? we dated for three years, you owe me answers n. its a complete dick move to disappear over a text message. its cowardly. and im crying here, missing food, missing sleep. i had to tell you all these things but you still didnt call me, when we were dating? now of course you dont owe me anything. go and be happy. you had your flaws and i dont think i can forgive you. but go and be happy. i dont need a phone call. i dont need you to break up with me on phone or in person. i dont think you have the courage to do that. i hope you gather than courage. because i dont like it when people use you and manipulate you. i know your past was brutal and because of that, you lack that courage of proper intervention. but i hope you move on. nobody will shout at you for being yourself.now let me talk about my anxiety. im extremely hurt. im worried i will never fall in love again. im worried that im too ugly. my anxiety is skyrocketing. i dont know what to do because i really feel scared about the future reddit. you can look at my post history and see how many times i have posted this very same thing. im very afraid about my future. its so uncertain. love looks tricky and i dont know if i can find it. there is nothing wrong with me as such. i am well read. i am a musician. i have a lot of depth in both philosophy and psychology. i have the most beautiful friends in the world who stayed up all night to help me. i dont think i am unlovable because i have so much love and it keeps increasing the more i give. i can give a lot of love. but im worried about the statistics. is it too late for me? im 27 and im an indian. so that means, that i have 2-3 years to find love before i enter the arranged marriage. nothing wrong with that also. im pretty sure i can find someone like you there. but i want better. im not sure if i will get it however. can i find love in 3 years? well, if i find it in america then that would mean i stay in america forever. that would suck because i dont like it here that much. great country but i feel socially isolated. and dating in india is extremely difficult. so that just leaves arranged marriage and 2-3 years before that. can i find love in 2-3 years? i have never had a year where i didnt go on dates before you. i have never had difficulty making female friends. most of my friends are girls. my success ratio was very good in india. but are there any single people in india who would like to settle down in 2-3 years? i dont know. probably not. and thats why i am anxious. that anxiety is scaring me away and all this mental gymnastic is turning into one sentence ""i will never find love again"". based on what? on fucking nothing. on the odds. but last case, an arranged marriage. if we include all the odds then i think there would be a very high probability for me to not be alone. but will i find love? again, i dont fucking know and i am getting really scared. im super jealous of you that you found love. im jealous because it feels like someone took all my self-esteem and happiness and gave it to your current boyfriend. im jealous because i feel like he is the better person. if i saw him in real life, im positive that i will fuck him up. at least by words. but i feel jealous of him. i feel like your boyfriend is perfect and im not. and that jealousy is so bad that i cannot even close my eyes. i close my eyes and see you asking him whats up sitting on a stone together with him. i close my eyes and i see a faceless man holding your hand in your college garden. and i feel jealous. lastly, i feel sad. i really loved you n. i wanted to marry you in a year. it was just bad timing and you also know that i dont hate you. i genuinely want you to be happy. im not in my senses and i know i have said a lot more than i should have. but i wanted to destroy all hopes. i tried so hard to say fuck you to you. but i couldnt bring myself to say it. but fuck you. you are the best person i have been with but fuck you for leaving me without a call. and i feel sad because i dont know what future has. there is an alternate life story where i marry you and we talk and we love. and i will never get to live that timeline and that makes me sad. we will never ever talk and that makes me super sad you know. ill miss you n. ill miss you. you gave me some of the best moments till now, in my life. and ill always love you for giving me back the love. fuck you for taking it away. go now. goodbye.

8hblls,i need some re-assurance. i feel like i will never find someone who will love me.,offmychest,"im a 27 year old indian male who grew up in india. i was in a long distance relationship with someone but she told me yesterday that she has moved on and is in love with someone else.not only am i very hurt, because i genuinely did my best to save the relationship and i also lost a very kind caring and understanding person but i feel like ill never ever find someone else and im burning inside with jealousy that she is now gone to someone else. and i also feel that ill be alone for the rest of my life.my only option is to go back to india at this stage and try to find someone there. i dont think ill ever find a date. im 27 and i am losing my hair from the crown and im not attractive at all. i am a nice person and i genuinely wanted to marry and spend the rest of my life with this person. ive been in two serious relationships and they all took away a part of me. and i think that this is the dead end for me. nobody will ever look beyond my looks. ill never be able to get a match on tinder and i dont know where and how else will i ever find love. the other option is an arranged marriage. i think i wont find someone who understands me there also. i will have to quit weed. my ex let me be myself. i will never be able to tell the person in an arranged marriage of all the scars that have marred me. i will lose my power of choice in meeting someone.im heading for a disaster and i think its statistically very likely that i will end up alone. ill never get to experience human affection. i will never get to experience unconditional love, never have an understanding with someone. nobody will ever love me and even if they do love me, they wont love me the way i am. they will love a version of me who has to hide himself because nobody will ever like the real genuine me.im literally dying of anxiety. then the feelings of my ex being with someone else just breaks me. i know there is no hope and im positive that there is no point. its over. but life looks so dreary right now. if it was not for some of my friends and some people who genuinely care about me, make sure that i eat, that i feel loved, that i feel validated say that this will get better and that i will definitely find love. but i find it impossible to believe. i lost someone who was very understanding. it was not completely my fault but i made plenty of mistakes. she did too.i dont know what im talking about. i feel very very crushed. my friends keep telling me that you are just low on self-esteem and its possible that i will find love. but im so ugly and i smoke weed that i dont know if anybody will ever like me.",2018-05-06 03:24:23,kartokovitz,1
8gtfbf,i just wanna talk about life,offmychest,"i dont know whether to laugh or cry. i have anxiety and i struggle with depression and substance abuse. when im not high, im constantly hating on myself. constantly running calculations in my head. my brain just runs faster than usual. i cry, i try to watch porn to distract myself. but then i get high and everything goes away. it feels like relief, beauty, calm and a complete understanding of the world is just a step away. so i get high. my life perpetually fluctuates between the two and im not ashamed of myself or depressed about it. its just that i broke up with someone i wanted to be with but i was hesitant because of anxiety and depression. and now im using marijuana as a coping mechanism. trust me, i do work out. i do have a routine. im active but im very alone except my books. im afraid of anything new. im the sort of person who is comfortable losing ground slowly everyday. i get up and i fall down and i have been doing that for a long time. i guess that is what rest of the humans do as well. its just that my intensity is so so loud and sonorous. everyday i face trouble falling asleep and as if that was not enough, i get up with a sort of panic attack. i really want to kill myself over not saying ""thank you"" to my barista.im from india and i was dating someone really nice and i couldnt really take the right decision. ironically, i just wanted to have sex with someone white and im afraid of being caught soliciting these things. so for three years, i kept trying and then i told her one day that that is the only reason i am in america and she was hurt but she laughed at the same time too. and now she is dating someone else. which is okay, good for her. but im alone and i looked up the entire arranged marriage tradition. someone asked me on a date but as a filter they asked me my educational background and my family background. i noped the fuck out of it. so here i stand. i have no interest in things which the world has to offer to me. i honestly have a lot of passion in me for music, for books, for poetry, for meditation. im genuinely dedicated to figuring this shit out and im honestly ahead of a lot of people, thanks, in part, to therapy.but i have no real human connections. and i feel like its either weed or things like a genuine human connection. i mean, where have i come, with all the philosophy and psychology and self-improvement. yes, i meditated a lot. yes, i improved myself. i still have issues, that is true. but i understand myself well enough to say that its funny and depressing at the same time. life makes no sense. success, money, status make no sense. they have no correlation, at least for me, to happiness. i dont even mind being sad to be honest. but it looks like this is it. the only thing that i feel like adds some meaning to my life is love really. sure my job can add meaning, gym can add meaning, writers like virgina woolf can add meaning and ill keep them all with me. but essentially, im happiest when im in love. but what really is love given my condition? arranged marriage or tinder. so lets talk about an arranged marriage. i have to tell my family background to the family of the girl before i get to see her. and i live in seattle. it should be safe for me to not disclose these details and still be a nice person. because my family is composed of simple village-dwelling people. my parents are the sweetest people in the world but they are not successful, they dont have any accolades to show off. they still say that me and my brother are their biggest achievements, i mean the kind of people we have grown up as. they wont qualify any screening test and so wont i. now lets talk about tinder or neo-dating. im brown, im fit but im not athletic. im decent looking but im no rockstar. i write nice messages to everyone on okcupid. i do feel frustrated at times but i still am not rude to anybody for their choice of not liking me. i get it. but where does that put me? three years. not a single good friend. and its getting worse. i have lost my energy to want to impress people. and neither do i expect this from someone. i know im not a 10. i usually dont message anybody out of my league. the only people i dont message are people who i am not attracted to at all. and i guess the people who reject me are coming from a similar position. but it essentially creates capitalism out of dating. i dont want sex. i dont want anything hot. or a person who hikes. i just someone who likes me. and i would genuinely try to make it work. i wont reject someone because they dont have a wanderlust or if they are a recovering alcoholic. do other people see dating in this way? in my experience, a lot of us dont.i meditated. i wrote my journals. i read amazing books. i watched amazing shows and movies. i learnt to make music. i learnt to appreciate all kinds of music. i became well versed in philosophy. i am on my journey to become fairly well versed in psychology. i got healthy and i ran for miles. people say that im intelligent and creative. but at the same time, i got a pornhub premium subscription. i have smoked weed almost everyday for the past two years. my career makes no sense. i developed a bit of an eating disorder. i broke up with my best friend and my girlfriend. i want to go back to india but where exactly? thats a shitty feeling you know. the home no longer exists. when people tell me that im intelligent and creative, i think they are just saying it. they dont mean it. i see that the problem here is with self-esteem. i see all my problems very clearly. i still cant fix them. my hands go automatically to weed, then to my penis and then to pornhub. i constantly lie to myself and also to others. thats the depressing part about it all. its a wall and i really really really wanna climb that wall, it will give me a lot of meaning. but i dont know how. i know everything about the wall, the color, the dimension, the material. but it seems like i dont have hands. i cant fucking climb the wall. so i take the door. but im too big for the door. i cant fit in. i have too much of a baggage to carry. so i turn back to my safe place. my home. but thats not there either. confused, i run from this corner to that corner and then i see weed. i smoke weed and the desolate desert of my existence turns into a plush booming oasis. but it soon goes away, the cold breeze of the oasis soon turns warm. and i find myself staring at the door again.so do i cry or do i laugh. im doing both at the moment. in my opinion, theres a very thin line between emotions. i also know that very few people will read this gigantic wall of text. its all good. no new information has been added to the system.

8gjpjq,life is not making any sense to me,offmychest,"she is now dating someone else. im honestly happy for her. i never drunk dialed her or anything except today morning when i told her that it was just unbearable for me and i lost my calm.i got up in the morning with a mild panic attack. i woke up in the middle of the night and started munching, jacking off. i have been smoking too much weed also as a way to cope. the thing is, i dont have any friends. i have one person whom i would call my friend but he is emotionally distant. im indian and hes american so theres also some cultural differences. im a total mess. i dont know why i texted her but i just really really miss her. i saw the arranged marriage thing today but im so not ready for getting married. i really wanted to marry her. i dont know when it will get better. i dont feel like eating, i dont feel like doing anything. i cannot focus on work. and worst yet, i come back to an empty home, a friendless, lonely existence. and its breaking me apart. life doesnt make any sense to me and i am not sure if i will ever move on. i messed up coming to us and i want to go back to india. but to whom do i go back to? where would i go carrying so many memories in my mind which have all turned salty. i didnt want anything fancy in life. i didnt even have big dreams. i only wanted some love, companionship, a hug. i didnt even want to have sex. i messed up guys. i messed up my life running after glamour and glitter. being cool by smoking weed. i messed up. life is not making any sense to me. im scared to death. i really need a hug.",2018-05-02 21:32:15,kartokovitz,1
8f4jol,i feel very sad and very alone and i see no hope,offmychest,"i just went home to meet her and she did say things like ""can we be friends?"" but i just didnt realize what she meant. i came back and she stopped talking to me. telling me that she is busy and i dont think she was lying to me either. i havent talked to her properly for two and a half months after i went over to see her and i wrote a very heartfelt letter telling her how i feel but she said ""there is nothing more to say"".i didnt cheat on her. i didnt manipulate her in anyway. even in my letter i told her that i have intimacy issues and while i want her to date me, she should really listen to her own heart.but i feel that i have been treated very unfairly and i dont know why. i know that she doesnt owe being nice to me but i really was on her side. we were a team. why would someone like that just abandon you? maybe she has issues but she can tell me and still leave me. do i not deserve even a phone call? after being with her for three years, do i deserve to be told all this over facebook messenger? im just clueless and hurt and alone you know. im trapped in this modern america and i know nobody here.i really just want a little bit of validation. im coming off age in the indian context and if i dont get married soon, i will run the risk of never getting married. i have lost hair on my crown. i dont think im a womanizer. i dont think a lot of girls find me attractive nevertheless but i am starting to feel that i really need human connection. i tried to work-out, meditate, journal, therapy all with one aim. so that i dont have to look for human support because to be honest, there is none. i dont want anybody because everyone seems to be breaking up with me. i can only love, be nice and respectful? what else is in my hands? this is usually not enough though. people fucking leave me alone.and i have issues. i tried to kill myself long long ago after a break-up. i wont do it now but honestly that is how much it sucks. i really wouldnt wish this feeling on the worst of my enemies. i dont know what im talking about. i know there is no coherence.

8baxli,the lecture on addiction made me pity myself,offmychest,"i was trying to understand my own addiction and marijuana abuse and why i cant quit. and also, why when i go back home in india, i dont want to smoke that much. i watched a few lectures on addiction and the genes which are susceptible to addiction and the most common sign for someone who will suffer from this sort of compulsive abuse is not their compulsion to score a hit but a compulsion to make the displeasure go away. the medical term for this sort of displeasure is ""dysphoria"", sort of the opposite of euphoria. and then i heard the stories of addicts and almost everyone feels socially vulnerable. they always feel as if they dont belong. it could be because of trauma but it doesnt matter how it is caused. you can look at my comment history and you can see how much i suffer from being judged all the time, from thinking that i am a bad person because people keep ghosting me, or feeling that im boring because i talk about my own set of interests and how i feel and i dont talk much about sports or bitcoin or other things. going through the lecture on dysphoria was like reading my own self. my mom was overly protective of me so i had literally no friends till i was 18. when i went to college, i finally found love and then she broke up with me. so,  as any sane person would, i tried to kill myself. i survived but then nobody wanted to talk to me. everywhere i go people would pick on me, they would call me crazy. some guy even accused me for stealing his laptop. i was so fucking glad that college was over.but then the same thing happened with my job. i made few good friends, started dating someone, she broke up. this time i didnt try to kill myself because i had some friends. but most of them moved on to different places and again i was stuck with people who did not understand me. they would say something about my miserable self-esteem and think it was a joke but i would be hurt so deep that i would seek refuge in weed. i came to america running away from this ghost that has chased me all my life. this sense of not belonging, not being comfortable in my own skin, always giving more and being returned less. some people did however give me as much as i gave and i have a few friends back home that i cherish every single day. so it was not all bad.and now in america, its been three years. i have no friends, i have no relationships. i used to go out with someone in india but she hasnt even replied back to my texts in more than two months. i dont think she wants to go out with me. thats fine, its her life and she is free to live it the way she wants. but im hurt, i feel different from others. i feel like nobody understands me and i feel like im all alone, by myself in this world. it might sound like i am blowing things out of proportion but im speaking emotionally here rather than analytically. i have parents and friends but they are across the atlantic and given my circumstances, i just cant go back. shit has not hit the roof yet so i guess ill persevere.i will try to do my best with this opportunity and this life still is a blessing. i just dont know how to solve this problem. its true that all my relationships in america are superficial but its also true for a significant chunk of americans i know. perhaps they are comfortable with this lifestyle but to me it looks dehumanizing. how am i supposed to write a profile on how awesome i am on okcupid? that by definition betrays the sort of humility and the idea of knowing someone i believe in? commodification of any human value, be it love, health, justice, might sound great from a utilitarian point of view but its actually self-effacing.i am not mad at anyone. i just think that its a very difficult problem to get over and partly me and partly society is to blame. im going to marijuana anonymous in the evening today and im getting a cat tomorrow to have a companion i can nurture. lets see if this works.thanks for listening",2018-04-10 23:12:05,kartokovitz,0
87pb2k,i feel judged all the time.,offmychest,"i was having some relationship issues so i chose not to go to work but i mentioned in my message to work ""i am going to be out for something really urgent. i apologize for the short notice. ill be back online in the evening for email errands"". and i feel so judged for saying that. i feel like my manager will think that im lame and also a pretentious liar. i feel like hell think that im incompetent and i feel so wrong about this incident, about being judged by my manager that i really feel a cringe and want to run away and never show my face to anyone, especially him, my manager. i feel like i should just disappear for having lied so blatantly to him. of course everybody can tell and now they think of me as a liar, a loser and probably someone worth every single ounce of scorn, hatred and mockery. i tried to reason with myself that this is probably just my anxiety or me making things worse or overly catastrophic but it seems to come back again and again and every time i recall them and their reaction in my head, i feel like im the stupidest liar in the whole universe and probably the most unprofessional, dishonest piece of shit. i feel like now they have busted me and figured out who i truly am and now they just think that im faking it. now the only question is how much they can tolerate me. i actually feel like i am faking it, ive never really worked hard but i have been performing well. at the core of this incident is my repeating anxiety and self-esteem issues. i just seem to think that i am a piece of shit and im hyper vigilant of the signs that me feel that way. this is not the first time that ive beaten myself over something like this. i remember feeling the same way about my coworker. i just dont like lying, that is true. but i didnt have an option here. i could have said that i feel sick but i sort of panicked and ended up saying something really stupid. i also tend to be very dutiful. i am ambitious, i like working hard. but i dont have a duty towards my corporation. at the very least, my duty with my gf comes before my work and if i was upset about my relationship, possibly a break-up, how could i have kept my cool and went off to work. to provide for one duty, one bond, one relationship i trust and enjoy and relish so much, i had to take from one relationship, which i feel completely dehumanized in. how could i have ever made any different of a choice. sure, i lied and even ended up making me sound very stupid. but i did it out of confusion between two duties and over-estimating the size of my official duties and commitments. secondly, i feel like not having a support group around me makes me bottle up all my love and a lot of my self-worth and it leads to utter confusion, not only in acting rationally and confidently but also estimating the damage for making a bad choice, like this casual leave today. and the harder anybody is to please, the more judged i feel by them. the more i feel like my imposter cover has been blown. and i tend to keep going through events about instances where i let my cover blow. im hyper-vigilant of signs in their behavior and most importantly my behavior around them. and i only focus on such incidents, not the whole picture. and this leads to a very crippling sense of dependence on others. i always want these people to like me. and these people are not there to like me, they are there to do their own thing. so, devoid of any validation from these people, i look for signs why they do not give me any validation. of course i think that its because they know what kind of a piece of shit i am. in my opinion the sense of sense ought to be based on the best version of ourselves instead of the worst version of ourselves. we all lie, cheat, make irrational mistakes, say stupid things. but you know what, for the most part, most people are fine people. they are just trying to navigate their own lives in this world, which at times is just miserable. i dont judge others so much, i frequently give anybody any kind of help and empathy i can. i think this should extend to me too. thats not only how i view others but thats how i view humans and human morality too. yes, psychologically speaking, stress, anxiety etc. makes us do silly things. but the part of us that passes on the judgement on the irrationality of our actions is just not the same person. theres no point judging that part because its almost as if there was no free will or partial free will involved. countless times, the same patterns and behaviors have popped up in the same order. but when i judge these incidents, i judge them from a dualist point of view where i had full control and full free will to act. but i didnt. there have however been a lot of incidents where i have gone against my instincts and use my rationality and my empathy to do things. those are the incidents i ought to judge myself because thats the part that represents me and my conscious actions. writing this made me feel awfully better. this community is great for someone like me to write stuff down and wish it away down the water. so i thank again.",2018-03-28 07:04:09,kartokovitz,1
87jbrh,i don't have anybody close to me to share this with me so please read it,offmychest,"i took a one month vacation and went back to see my parents, girlfriend, friends etc. i was doing really well in life. i barely felt depression, i was exercising regularly, meditating, eating well. my therapist told me that hes honestly in awe with the amount of progress ive made in the month i was away. my girlfriend stopped talking to me the moment i flew back from her. for a almost a month she kept saying that shes depressed. so i gave her space. when she tried to talk to me in the night, i said you can rather sleep because youre not feeling well. now i was worried what is up with her. she would see my message and not reply back and i distinctly remember that i couldnt sleep two nights because of all this. i was finally kicking depressions ass. and ive been fucking depressed forever. self-harm, hygine, i check every single box when it comes to depression. but i was kicking it. for the first time in my life. i wanted to go back to school, i wanted to do so much more. but now my gf, to whom i was supposed to marry next year says she doesnt see me as a relationship.it hurts but it hurts in so many different ways. im afraid that i live in an area where statistically speaking, the odds are not in my favor. and even if the odds were just fine, i dont really like dating. i like being in a relationship with someone built around trust, validation and love. and im 27 already and i dont know if its too late because i get depressed fairly easily when theres nobody to comfort me. and it feels as if this will be the start of another long and painful episode of depression and ill lose another year of my life and along with it, health, hair, energy and sense of happiness.i really liked her. i really liked the kind of person she had been and the kind of personal she makes me feel like. i feel so much better around her and not in a validating way either. depression, support groups and other forms of self-improvement has made me very self-aware of human behavior and biases. so honestly, she could not validate me because she was just not up for the jedi mind tricks and rhetorics i was pulling out. but i genuinely enjoyed helping her out. i helped her with her educational finances because i really didnt want her to give up on her dream. and now hearing from her life is too short for compromises with a smiley face in the end just makes me super mad. life is indeed about compromises. its about the kind of compromises you can live with. something that might be compromising in one way but rewarding in the other. and it makes me mad that she feels this way. im not going to correct her, im not mad at her at breaking up with me. she is her own person and good for her. i just care too much about her and she and i both have nurtured both of us, and how we view relationships and trust. and to see her take such a u-turn makes me feel really sad. the depression makes it all the worse because after having such a (at least in my opinion) virtuous relationship, i dont want to go back to dating. i dont want to date. but i need a support group outside friends. and it will be such hard work and struggle to do it all over again. i was just happy it was all in the past and i could focus my efforts on helping others, like my alcoholic brother or my aging parents. perhaps i should do that. i would still, at the very least, really like someone to listen to me. i know im probably just rambling because i have written this entire thing in one go. but this made me feel so much better. and strangely, some head-nods will give me validation, empathy and forgiveness towards my own and herself.thank you.",2018-03-27 17:31:11,kartokovitz,1

6s1b2v,playing guitar has changed my life.,offmychest,"i learnt how to play guitar last october. it was a slow start but i kept playing as a form of escapism. i tried quitting weed. i tried going to gym. i tried making friends. i tried not to get a validation from people online. along with all this struggle, i kept playing. a couple of days back, i played in front of my friend and he said im pretty good at it. it was the first time i played for someone so that was a pleasant surprise. i used to think that im shit. then i was home alone a last tuesday and i got high and kept playing. but this time i focussed on my best and ended up recording myself. i was completely amazed at hearing the recording. i was actually good. not in a cocky way but if anybody played like that id be impressed. the feeling of being good started snowballing. i recorded myself and listened back. it was better than before. and very soon i realized that i could play the same things easily now. more people appreciated my playing. someone even jammed with me today. i felt more confident in myself.the learning curve was crossed. ill hit another learning curve soon but i can play rhythm from pink floyds time. and i have been playing for 8-10 hours since that day. i know that its still a form of escapism but i dont hate myself so much. everyday someone comes up to me and says ""that was awesome"" or ""that was great"". and it raises my self-esteem to a whole new level. i played for my mom and she said ""im proud of you"".it felt great. im no longer mad at myself. good job me. you worked hard.

57vg61,i need a friend very desperately. loneliness has driven me to a place i don't know.,offmychest,"something is left behind in life. there are some dreams that were very precious to me. some people who were very special for me. and their loss is too much to handle. there is no hope for future really. never ever in my life have i been able to hold up a relationship of any kind. youre so ugly and unattractive that there is really no hope for finding love in this world anymore for you. there is no hope for anything. that skydiving pass you got for yourself for 200 dollars ? its down the drain since youre never going to make use of it. people just somehow tolerate you. you have failed in making even the basic human bonding in america and bonding is really the most important thing you can have in this life. no accomplishments of superhuman talent or stature are ever going to give you joy if you dont have anybody to celebrate them with. every single day is a challenge. when im elated and kind of on a good way chasing my goals, it feels like im just too happy ? that i do not deserve to be happy for some reason ? im not really afraid of dying even a tiny bit. life sucks so much , why should i love it ? im not suicidal. but i do not find any interest in this body either. and why should i ? what hedonist pleasures have i indulged myself into ? im a 26 year old virgin. and i dont mind being a virgin at all to be honest. i dont see all the fuss about sex in the first place.get high alone. feel more alone. masturbate. get high. feel lonely. masturbate. and keep repeating. im not ready for this adulthood. i dont want a job. i really want a friend. i have this strange pang of loneliness inside of me that i would really like to share with someone. but who ? i left my therapist. it also feels very less time with the therapist. i feel like therapist is not a sustainable model. or maybe my mind has convinced me that we dont need a therapist. melancholy. im really desperate for a friend. i tried and i do have acquaintances but i dont have friends. i cannot tell them that im depressed. i cannot tell them that im not a liar. its just that i dont feel anything is worth fighting for so i make excuses. i might have said a lie but i didnt ever live one. how do i communicate myself. what happened to my friends ? why do they not like me anymore ? i didnt do anything, i was set up. why wont anybody forgive me. i forgive everyone. and i dont even think im sorry. im asking for forgiveness because its very difficult to justify my point of view. im sure if i got an honest hearing, i would not come out as a monster. i will go to office but what for ? i got promoted and it gave me joy for five minutes ? why did i bust my ass for promotion ? wast it really worth it ? was coming to america worth it ? if its not then why the fuck am i not going back. what is this complacence of weed and porn and ben & jerrys. how do i break it ? ive failed so many times in my attempts to break out that i have started taking breaks from taking breaks. my streak can start tomorrow, today ill give myself a rest. piano lessons can wait till tomorrow. and why do i have this superman idea of perfection in my mind ? why am i trying to learn both the piano and the guitar at the same time ? who does that ? why am i doing it in the first place. why did i try to learn drawing ? why do i want to do everything. and even if i do, what cant i stick with it and not smoke weed and chill. will the younger me be really happy seeing me ? will he look at me with eyes of disappointment. i dont think so because i have never ever been an unkind person. why should the younger me be unkind to myself. what should i do with myself and my life. why does every cigarette make me feel so remorseful. and if it does, why do i keep doing this ? how do i break from this cycle. please show me a way that works. should i change my apartment ? should i go buddhist ? should i hire a hooker ? what am i supposed to do in my life ? college is over, i got the job. i got a little bit of savings but what now ? i wish i had a friend i could touch.

7tp2gl,i recovered.,depression,"excuse me if i write like a 12 years old. not a native english speaker. i just want to put it out there. for people who dont know if its really your own thoughts or if its depression makes you feel like this and suffer like this. heres what i think and went through: im lucky enough to recover from my depression now. i was depressed for more than a year. i didnt know it was a sickness. i thought all those negative thoughts come from me. because how could it not be? the pain, the self doubts, the self loathing, the anxiety, all those suffering was so real and painful. i remember i cried every night(in day time too) and used up so many tissue paper for more than a year. i stopped eating for a few months because my stomach felt weird and doctor couldnt find out why physically. i dropped a whole 15kg in that time. i consistently went to therapist and doctor every week and at some point tried to kill myself. my friends had to call the cops on me. sometimes i think back and think to myself if i was really depressed or was i just too stubborn to let things go? nope. thats definitely a sickness. because i cant cry my eyeballs out every night for that long even if i want to now. i dont want to die now. i still struggle to get out of bed but thats because my beds too comfy. i look forward to the next day now. i still struggle from some social problems but who doesnt. point is: no one wants to be sad and miserable all the time. its not something you would want or fake to ""get attention"" or ""play the victim"". its pure pain and suffering. you telling someone how you feel is not whining, its you gathering whatever strength you have left in your body and trying to get help. i never want to go back to that stage again. and i do not wish to see any of you suffer. i wish i could help but im not a psychiatrist or therapist. i just wish that you can get those help and talk to them. the only help i can offer is what i tried to do: try to get comfy when youre feeling sad. its hard to feel that bed when youre really comfy in bed. hug the teddy bear that you had from your childhood or just get a soft toy, any animal or robot or anything of your own choice. wrap in a blanket and hug them when youre sad and want to cry. watch some funny videos in youtube. dont get out of bed if you really dont want to but instead really take your meds on time. clean your room. a clean room really helps. stop smiling if you dont want to. talk more in here if youre not comfortable talking to your friends and family anymore. we all have or had depression here so we somehow understand what youre going through. i really hope you guys can get through it.

ack5xc,"serious advice: avoid melancholic music, make an empowering/uplifting playlist and blast it on repeat. it might save your life. (backstory inside)",depression,"some backstory. a woman id been in a relationship with for more than 6 years broke up with me. i was very much still in love with her (and still am), and no matter what i tried i wasnt able to get over her. i spiraled into increasingly deep depression and insomnia, and frequently considered taking my life.on a phone call with my parents a month ago i divulged that id been feeling ""a little down recently,"" which theyd noticed themselves based on my tone of voice, but i avoided telling them the extent to which i was is danger. my moms heart is in the right place but knowing that id been considering ending my life for the past two months would cause her stress and worry, and i didnt want to inflict that on her. my dad, on the other hand, was the directer of a psychiatric hospital for more than 30 years, so hes dealt with countless depressed clients, and even though i downplayed my situation to them on the phone he seemed to pick-up on the situation better than my mom.while i was home for christmas/new years, i offhandedly mentioned to my dad that id been listening to a lot of damien rice recently. my dad enthusiastically took an interest and we listened to a bunch of damien rice songs together. eventually, he noted that a lot of rices songs have a very melancholic tone to them, and told me about the patients hed had over the years who, while dealing with depression, intuitively thought that listening to music that matched their depressed mood made them feel better. we had a great conversation about mental health research that points to the opposite result, that people who are already clinically depressed feel worse while/after listening to music that matches their mood, and that the exact opposite has been found if they instead listen to uplifting music.the conversation prompted some reflection from me and i realized 1) it suddenly seemed obvious to me that listening to depressing music while depressed would make the depression worse, not better, and 2) id intuitively been drawn to listening to a lot of depressing music over the past two months.the next day i started building a spotify playlist of songs that are uplifting/empowering. some are takes on relationship breakups but from a more positive, self-empowering angle (kelly clarkson: stronger, since u been gone; little mix: shout out to my ex; ariana grande: thank u, next; christina aguilera: fighter; lizzo: good as hell)some are just songs that i find to be happy confidence boosters (sara bareilles: brave; macklemore & ryan luis: cant hold us; daya: sit still, look pretty; katy perry: roar)meanwhile ive actively avoided listening to any morose songs that would let me wallow in my depression and obsess on the loved one that i lost, and its honestly amazing what a difference its made. is my depression ""cured""? hell no, thats an ongoing struggle, but since i made this change i seriously have been feeling like im on an upward trajectory for the first time in a very long time. yesterday i put my playlist on shuffle and danced alone in my room for half an hour, and it felt great.if anyone has their own songs that help keep them in better spirits add a comment, im still looking for new songs to add to my playlist. and if anyone just needs a friendly exchange, feel free to comment for support.",2019-01-04 19:06:54,IAmTheJudasTree,0

9zb7k0,i’m a fucking disgrace *trigger warning suicide self harm*,depression,"edit:: (13 minutes after posting) this was a rant, i’m much better now. it didn’t take very long after posting this to feel better. i don’t want to kill myself and i’d never do it, but i say so because i feel like doing it (if that makes any sense at all) i have my comfort items, my boyfriend talked to me and calmed me down. i’ll be okay. thank you guys for commenting and reading/supporting etc. my boyfriend sent me here because i was ranting to him about how much i hate myself and want to kill myself and before that, torture and hurt myself. first it started off with my mom telling me that it’s inappropriate for me, an 18 year old, to hang out with a long time friend who happens to be 15 almost 16. bull. shit. i hate this so much because i met my boyfriend when he was almost 18 and i was 15. when he turned 18 in december, i was still 15 until february. we had a fucking family friend who hung out with me constantly who lived with us. she was 22. i was like 15 or 16. bull. shit. dumb. ass. shit. then, i’m pissed at my mom so my piece of shit self takes it out on my boyfriend (who might i add, i’ve hurt multiple fucking times and left him more times than i can count because of my ignorant bullshit) (we’re doing better [i fucking hope]) who loves me very much, would do just about anything for me, etc. i take my anger out on him. he doesn’t deserve it. i get mad fucking quickly and he doesn’t deserve this at fucking all. i honestly feel like ending everything right here right fucking now. i can’t do this anymore. i say this, but a few hours ago i was excited about getting my guinea pigs and moving out in march. right now, a few stupid goddamn hours later, i’m sitting here uncomfortably sobbing, choking on my tears, and wanting to end everything. another thing that sucks ass is that my fucking bossy ass sister (36 years old) is coming with her entire family (kids husband friend and her husbands kids) which is going to take up waaaay more space than we fucking have in our house. not only that, i’m super paranoid she’ll go through my room. not that she’ll find anything, but she’ll see one thing out of place and fucking destroy the entire room. or shell send me up to find something in say the bathroom, i won’t be able to find it (god fucking help me) and she’ll be like “oh it’s in this room, your room” and tear it apart. i’m really really bad at looking for shit but come on. i don’t know where shit is in my house sometimes. also, i have dermatophagia. a disorder where one chews and bites on their hands and nails cuticles etc. i don’t mean just lightly to trim them or anything. nope. until i’m dropping blood. it’s not self harm so don’t even go there. it’s something i’ve been living with for years and there hasn’t been a day (since i started again because i’m a piece of human garbage) that i haven’t bitten since i was at least 8. i want to stop so fucking badly but i have no idea fucking how. it’s a huge insecurity of mine. back to my mom, i went downstairs earlier after we argued about stupid age shit and told her something that was bugging me and she ignored me. i said “did you hear me?” she said “yeah. whatever”. this was when i came upstairs and actually contemplated suicide. i actually thought about it. no doubt in my mind i was going to self harm (i’m two years and one month clean and i ended up not doing it) but i wanted to end it all. right there. thanks for coming to my bullshit post. feel free to comment or whatever.

achw6p,so with depression related apathy wants to break up due to lack of feelings. any advice?,depression,"my (25) girlfriend (26) is coming back from a major depression disorder. weve been through thick and thin these last 4 months and had a passionate relationship.she went on to take new meds recently, which makes her feel better in general, but apathetic, without much energy or overall feelings.because of this she came to me saying something is wrong between us - it was since i wasnt being able to understand her new behavior and we disconnected a bit - and she is confused and inclined to break up.im worried sick about her and i dont think we should break up right now, at least give it some time to digest everything first and then make a better judgment in the near future.anyone has ever gone through anything similar? any advice perhaps?cheers everyone :) ",2019-01-04 14:54:11,thacoffeeman,1
a361ia,how do you distract your mind?,Anxiety,"im not sure about you guys but ive recently fully understood how much is my own mind which makes me anxious.i spent a lot of time thinking it was probably chemical and tried every thing besides medication to improve the possible imbalance. that may actual be a thing but after sometime doing psychotherapy, trying lots of things and, of course, thinking, ive come to notice how much is my own mind ""who"" constructs my reality.in that sense, i found really hard to abstract myself from thinking and being over conscious of my own self and my own feelings/situation. fortunately, i dont really have any problems in my life which would cause me so much anxiety, besides anxiety itself. as such, i really think that the biggest problem im facing right now is being overly conscious of myself. if i could but tone it down enough, i believe in due time i could get back to feeling well and non anxious.so i was hoping you had something which helps to put your mind off of yourself? something to dim out the anxiety even if just a little.i try to meditate and all but sometimes i figure that the fact that im doing something to try and reach a certain place often just makes me more conscious of myself and enhances my anxious state.any thoughts?thank you so much in advance fellows. big cheers ",2018-12-05 01:06:13,thacoffeeman,1
9snxp5,so going through depression. how can i help?,depression,"my so is going through a tough depression and i wanted to help her however i can. i try to be with her as much as possible, ill bring and cook dinner to her place, i dont offer that much advise but try to say positive things to her, take her or bring her to work whenever possible, etc. however i feel like i could do more or better. for instance, she has financial problems and wont allow me to help her, given that we have only been dating for a few months. also i was thinking of trying some charity stuff or something so she could have more to eat (she tries to save money to pay rent and ends up sacrificing eating a bit). or perhaps im not saying the right stuff or looking for more solutions for her life - finding a new job, guaranteeing she has more money, talking to her family who is a bit distant, seeing that she eats more, etc. you or your so, what sort of things could i possibly do to help her out? how were you helped or how did you help your so? what are good things to do and bad things not to do? how did you work around your life with depression or how should i engage with her problems better? i was thinking of doing a list of stuff she needs help with and talk with her about it and how i can help her. let me you know of your experience... thank you in advance ",2018-10-30 15:34:02,thacoffeeman,1

94vky0,my mum and her denial,depression,"basically my mum doesnt give a shit about me and my mental health. im not saying this because i feel like she doesnt care, im saying this because of various reasons, like: when i had my very first mental breakdown and spent 15 days crying in bed and sleeping without moving the only thing she did was telling me ""think about starving kids in africa theyre doing worst than you"" and then put the dog on my bed instead of conforting me herself. at that point i asked her to see a therapist. she allowed me to do that but, like she always does, she started to make me feel extremely guilty about the fact that we couldnt afford even that upon the other expences and telling me things like ""we have to pay your therapist so i dont know if well have money to go grocery shopping"". we had money for both since my father a month later bought a fucking vehicle for 3.000€, but still. shes always been like that.at first i though she didnt know what to do with depression and how to deal with someone who is depressed (which is very strange, considering her older brother passed away in an accident when she was around my age, which is 21/22, and that is the kind of thing that would probably make you feel depressed i guess), so i just forgave her and tried to pick myself up the best i could. then my brother had his breakdown, started hearing voices that werent there, stopped sleeping, started yelling in the middle of the night and writing stuff on the walls with a pen. of course my anxiety at this point got super bad, cause thing were basically falling apart with my ex, i had to give exams, i couldnt function and i was waking up at seven am by my mother who asked me to scrape off the words my brother wrote on the walls ""as quietly as you can"". i did. while having and anxiety crisis all the time i spent on the wall with a sponge erasing threats against every single member of my family of ""gutting us like animals"". then she became, like, *the best mum ever.* always there to give him support, always rushing over him and worrying, asking him stuff, trying her best to be close to him. and i got so mad, cause she was capable of being next to my brother, then why did she teated me the way she did in the past? then i realized. of course she didnt stayed close to me when i was ill: everything was going great with her. she only worried about me when she needed comfort and if i couldnt provide that because i was sick then she would ""worry"" (by which i mean making me feel guilty because i couldnt take no more). i went to live with my grandma for january cause i was super done with dying in anxiety and crying three hours per day when i wad okay, i needed a place to stay calm or i would just go insane. she helped me pack and gave me the key of the car, told me to have a ""nice trip"" and went back inside to check my brother.i went to my grandmas house crying hysterically and i didnt stop for hours. i just cried and cried until i was too exhausted and i slept. the morning after i told my ex-boyfriend that i was way too depressed to get out of bed and i couldnt see him and i was very sorry. he got angry (yeah, he was emotionally abusive as fuck, maybe one day ill write the story but he fucked me up pretty badly mentally), and i just shutted my phone up, got into bed and started writing suicide notes to my friends and my grandma. once i finished i realized that i couldnt go to the bathroom, let alone go to the top of a building and jump off.so i decide that i need medicine and i need therapy asap. where i live we have free healthcare, so i ask my mum to come with me to take the appointment with the psychiatrist. he saw me, diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and we started with medicines.my mum never asked me how it was. she never asks about medicines, my health, how im doing. the medicine arent working still and i never took that many pills in a lifetime, but she doesnt even notice that. she discovered i wad being medicated when i told my older brother about it in the living room and she reacted with a ""okay"". just an okay.i told her my diagnosis when i was hysterically crying because i just broke things off with my ex and she kept talking to me about what my father did that day that was *so wrong and shitty * she just didnt care that i was sobbing in the car next to her. what she told me? ""oh you think *im* not depressed?""then just kept on telling me how bad she was feeling and how life was cruel to her.meanwhile here i am, all alone at 21 years of age, with basically nothing cause my parents managed to burn down every single piece of property they couldve left to us, with a broken brain since i was so little i litteraly cannot remember when it started precisely, five attempted suicides. and my mum just wants to talk about how she fucked up her own life and she feels miserable about it. after i told my psychiatrist this he told me to go live to my grandmas, because my house was way too toxic and i could never improve there. i kept staying there for a while cause i felt guilty about living my brothers and my mum alone, but then my little brother (the one that probably has schizophrenia, but nobody in my family is willing to accept the problem and do something about it) almost punched me in the face because i asked him how he was doing.i am very petite girl with zero muscles cause i hate sports, my brother has harms as big as my head basically. he couldve busted badly my face in a matter of seconds, but luckly for me i have good reflexes, so i avoided it for the most part. he bruised my face though.i told my mum what happened via text and she didnt reply. she didnt say anything. than she said that i should be patient with my brother whom is *very sick and very angry.* that was the day i moved into my grandmas house and my mum thinks it is only because i am mad at her for no reason. like my whole life revolves around how she feels and what she wants. because she taught me that i can never feel bad or sad or angry when she is, she is the important one that needs to talk. i am the one that is supposed to listen to her problems since i was in elementary school. she litteraly took me from class when i was 8 to show me how badly my father punched her in the face. im sorry for the long posts, but i have a lot of shit im going through and im basically quitting every relationship with my mum whatsoever because of this. i just need her to give me money, cause she is supposed to and she promised me and i am in uni and cannot work because of my depression (my psychiatrist basically begged me not to find a job cause it would only make me feel worst). when ill feel better i will work my butt of and be indipendent and never speak to her ever again. but the fact is that i am dropping someone that to me was my *hero.* i love my mum so much, she can be kind and amazing and she protected me when my father wanted to kick the shit out of me, she tried to raise me alone the best she could and i just cant leave her behind without feeling like i have lost everything in my life. i feel like i hav nothing and i need to build an empire all by myself without the help of anybody, while having no arms and no idea of how to build said empire. everyday i think that dying would be the best option, but i cant die, i promised my best friend we would climb mount depression together and get to the top together.i just feel stuck in life. everyone that shouldve loved me no matter what just disappointed me again and again. my mum broke me to pieces and she doesnt even care. she has two sons and a doll that she can use however she wants, thats it. it sucks. it feels shitty to know that the person that choose to put you into this world just left you completely alone and was never there when you really needed that. now all she does is call me from time to time and tries to make me feel guilty about not helping her in our house and wanting to be here to do nothing. she knows i am depressed, that its bad, that i take way more medication than my brother and that im way more at risk than him. she just doesnt give a fuck and that sucks. like, a lot.",2018-08-06 00:55:52,crisisnotcool,0

acgk6m,i don't know how to tell me parents that i am too depressed/anxious to finish in an out-of-state university.,depression,"## my freshman and sophomore years at the university of washington went very well. then everything changed with no explainable reason. the last quarter of my sophomore year i got the best grades ive gotten in college and made the deans list for the first time, and a new girlfriend that i was crazy about. during that summer, i had another uneventful summer at home. i returned at the end of august to spend another year living with my friends in a residence that i preferred more than the year before. nothing had gone wrong and everything was looking up.on the first day of classes, i had my first panic attack. my heart and mind were racing, i had a lingering nausea, i couldnt focus on anything, and a full sense of emergency and a need to leave immediately. i made up an excuse about a doctors appointment to the friend i was sitting with and left mid-way through the first/syllabus introductory lecture i had scheduled for my first day of the quarter. i cried as quietly as i could in my bedroom the whole day.within a week or so, i went to my first psychiatrist and psychologist sessions. i was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. to be honest the depression diagnosis caught me off-guard. i thought i had just gotten extremely anxious.that was 2 years ago and now i realize that depression is likely the root of my anxiety. i feel like my existence is wasting everyones time by having anyone expend time or use resources on anything that goes toward or depends on my existence. i feel like a black-hole, minus anything interesting.my parents have sort of adjusted to the diagnosis that i received, which feels more accurate than ever. i even was cutting myself last year and somehow finished that quarter and continued on to the next, which i had to convince my mother to let me do (she knew). my dad asks now and then how well im holding up, with respect to my condition. my mother also experiences depression, and so is sometimes a vital resource and often the only one i can think to unload to for advice.i no longer feel this way. she lied to me about my ability to go back (which at the time i wanted), causing me to lose trust in her as a resource. i anguished and convinced her that going back was in my better interest. my dad is not always a great place to go to for advice, either. hes great, but like me, is not great to go to for advice. my mom can be... but will sometimes see the issues in me as something she can frustratidly lecture out of me. and those lectures, either through experience or learned anxiety, have sort of taught me to hide or sugar-coat my problems to her. a tldr for this paragraph would say: i have transitioned to a place where i feel very uncomfortable talking to my parents about my problems.since, i have started the first quarter of my last year at uw and i have completely failed. almost everything is at its very worst. i failed every single class (stopped doing anything school-related after week 6 of 10/didnt even go to finals + have not told my parents), im afraid to leave my room (literally pee in bottles sometime to avoid opening the door.... not proud+ so ashamed), i eat very little and never anytime near a regular meal should be scheduled, i am sick often, and just hate myself in general.i avoid stressful conversations until the very last minute... which brings us to now.i want to say that i want to come home. even though i am 3/4 the way through college, i cant continue. not on this trajectory, because i fear i may actually be dead if i keep trying (either through self infliction or my extremely poor health choices).how do i tell my parents that i need to abandon that which they have saved up for my entire life when i am so close to the finish line? im so close, have drained my college savings fund and then some+loans, social and emotional capital, and accrued personal shame to the point that i cannot talk to my close high school friends who have no clue to all these struggles.i feel 200% alone. i feel like i cant talk to friends or family, and at the same time i need to make a huge announcement to family and will need friends. i feel like i have neither as a resource and everything is as worse as ever.help me. how do i navigate this? at the very least, how do i tell my parents that after all of this, this is when i decide i can no longer do it. i am scared and dont know what it even looks like on the other side. if there is an other side.thanks to anyone who can give input.x",2019-01-04 11:28:25,squigglepound,1

9l5v6i,a really old childs game makes me realize how lonley i really am.,depression,"(its really late at night and i just kind of threw up my thoughts on page so i might repost this but fix it up so it could actually be more readable and fix some errors but im going to bed right now good night)the game is called toontown, its an old disney online game where you are toony animals (like micky mouse or donald duck) and you have to defeat evil robots called ""cogs"" that are trying to turn the toony world into a huge corporation, but the thing that makes me enjoy the game so much is that its impossible to complete the game alone, so its really easy to meet people and really good for lonely people to make friends just like you and me. god i remember how many good friends ive made on it. the connections are so strong is that you would load up the game and only come off if those special people arent online. there was this one guy called j.c, he was a brown smallish duck if i remembered correctly, he didnt speak good english but god we were basically best friends. 90% of the time when we were both online we would be together fighting cogs and just talking, making jokes and just generally bonding. 2 people on different sides of the planet just making good memories. but all good things come to an end, like i said, we would only be online if the other friend was online due to the game (like all games) getting stale after a while. 1 time i had to unexpectedly go for a week, i was 14 at the time so whenever i went somewhere for holiday i had no choice but to go. i was so excited to come back and play toontown with my friend, but he wasnt online, and of course the game itself was now stale for me but that didnt matter if i had friends online, but he wasnt. we were now both stuck in this mode where we would hop on 1 minute a day just to see if they were online but it they werent we would just go back offline. we never did get the timing right, and it began to go from 1 minute a day to check to 1 minute a week to 1 minute a month, until we eventually gave up. we never talked to each other since i came off for a week, not because we didnt want to, but because couldnt be waiting for weeks. now his status on the game was ""online more than than a year ago."" sometimes i think about it and realise that since i was 14 i never really had a good connection with someone like j.c before, and that was in a video game. im 17 now. it makes me depressed just thinking about it, how do i get that feeling again that theres someone thats only there for you? how have i never had a best friend like that? will i ever find like someone like that again? or am i going to be my only best friend? i mean, i have friends but theres always that thought that they dont really care that much about you. i suppose i should just be thankful that i have these memories. thank you j.c.another person i met in toontown was this pink cat, named princess glory. holy. shit. i will never forget about this person. shes probably the most nicest people ive ever met and we had such a good connection. like, super duper good. it got to the point where i would stay up at 1am just to chat with her. ( she lives in america while i lived in the uk so timezones where weird which means she only came online really late for me ) fuck school, i want to spend time with this person, nothing is a better feeling that when they come online, they straight away teleport to you, do the ""wave hand"" emote, and then ask how was your day. the most powerful feeling from our relationship was probably how we went from nothing to basically best friends. at first, when i added her to my friends list, we really didnt talk. everybody have those people on their friends list that you did one thing with and then never spoke to them again, we were going to be like those ""friends."" we probably would but for some strange reason i really tried to talk to her, i would remember asking questions or just trying to make talk with her anyway possible. i would type, press enter, then fucking run to the other side of the room because i would be scared on what they would say or how she would react lol. ( im really shy if you cant tell ) that feeling of risking it all ( although i really wasnt ) was so thrilling for me. and its not like i could just press an entry key and talk to people in real life.over a while, of me forcing myself to join her lobbies in defeating bosses then me making talk we came closer and closer. its a really good feeling when you always been starting conversation with the person but then they start to talk to you instead of the other way round. our relationship grew bigger and bigger.im not going to lie, i grew a crush on a pink cat. while it didnt last long as i found out she has a husband and a kid, toontown definitely got me to know the feeling for the first time in my life, and currently my only time. i mean, ive had crushes before but like ive said, im shy and we never really had a good connection. princess glory was completely different, finally a girl who i have a really good connection with. i loved every single second of us talking.we would of kept chatting forever if the timezones werent so bad. sometimes the weight forces you down. while i loved this person, playing a game that gone stale for me ages ago, and also staying up at 1am just to wait for them to come online, its really dis motivating. i eventually stopped going online, and its my fault this time, unlike with j.c where i didnt have a choice to leave, this time i did and i fucked it up. now princess glory is currently at ""offline over a year ago"" and i have no idea if i will ever chat with her again. god, i miss that feeling so fucking much, you have no idea.the whole point of this is that god i missed having people like that in my life. according to my mum i might be autistic and i used to think i will eventually get to meet people like that again, but now with this information, i actually have no idea, and it hurts to fucking much. i have might have a disability that effects me from talking to people. all i want are these connections again, i want people in my life that have the strong feelings of friendship and love which is equal for both sides. and im scared guys, in not sure if i will be able to meet anyone like that again, or feel this special feeling again. if im being 100% honest i get really depressed thinking about it, but at the same time i love it.princess glory or j.c, if your reading this, thank you so fucking much for the memories :). i love you guys.",2018-10-04 01:05:50,Mrhollywood03,0

acdx15,"at the point in this cycle where ""maybe i don't need medication? maybe i'm not crazy?""",depression,"i stopped taking abilify cold turkey in november.  ive been out of adderall since september.  im still taking wellbutrin but im not sure what it does, and im considering going off that as well, just to see where im at after a few weeks of not taking anything.  i havent been completely unmedicated since...2009?  although the cocktail of meds has been switched up a little since then.  anyways, all that is to say, i dont know whats me anymore.and like...i know that can be the kind of language people who are fundamentally against medication use, or who may have pseudoscientific beliefs about mental health, to dissuade others from taking medication, or to discredit the concept of psych meds.  like that medication can make you lose yourself, turn you into a zombie, etc.  and i can also get behind the ""if you cant make your own seratonin, store bought is fine"" kind of mentality too.  just, ive been medicated pretty much since puberty, and the breaks ive taken without medication have been brief.  i stopped taking abilify because i connected the extreme fatigue i was experiencing to that medication (plus not having money for the refill), and it got me wondering if there are other components of my personality or health that i currently take for granted that may also be side effects of drugs.  its possible that i dont really *know* what my baseline is anymore, right?  im not going as far as to convince myself that medication is causing my depression, but maybe my shit is more manageable now than it used to be, and i just dont know it?  or like, if i stop taking medication long enough, and let myself reset, it will be more clear what my symptoms and needs are?  but then i also have a hormonal iud, and ive heard people say that the mirena has caused depression for them...so even if i stop taking my psych meds, what if my fucking birth control is making me depressed too?  how can i ever know what the hell is happening with me?i dunno.  im diagnosed bipolar, and theres such a stereotype of bipolar folks just up and quitting their medication because theyre fucking crazy people.  but really, mood stabilizers can make you feel terrible.  antipsychotics can make you feel terrible.  and im just tired of not knowing whether i feel like garbage because of medication or because its who i am.and then, of course im concerned about being completely unable to survive without medication, and im worried that i cant even last without medication long enough to figure any of this out.  i just cant imagine being completely dependent on medication for the rest of my life though, especially when i have developed so much physically and mentally since i was initially medicated.  i was first medicated when i was 13, and im almost 29 now.  it feels important to figure this out, because i think ill always wonder if im actually crazy or if im just dependent on meds.  its just really daunting to not know what to expect.im seeing a new psychiatrist tomorrow, out of convenience more than my interest in her--a friend has a new practice and was able to make me an appointment with their psych for tomorrow.  hopefully shes helpful, but i kind of dont know what to say to her.  writing this out has helped give me a sense of what to say, so thanks if youve read this.id appreciate any insight on these sort of feelings that yall might have.  im at a really low point currently, really not feeling capable of the self-care sort of maintenance things people recommend in place of medication, plus i work at night in the service industry so im just too fucking tired to take care of myself.  but i would like to hear other peoples perspectives on these sort of feelings.  thanks <3",2019-01-04 05:27:13,att4ck_,1

8w2871,the only one with mental integrity is me...,depression,"now lets get started, i have depression. i have had it for most of my life(18 btw)i was constantly bullied and abused because of the way i looked, the things i done, the way i spoke etc etc. i dont really care about all that shit. throughout school i was constantly shunned, i just kept my head down, doing my work. now, while im sitting here in my room contemplating, i realise something. something that i should be proud of, but i just really hate it. its how strong minded i am. i say strong minded in comparison to the rest of the household. im the oldest of my siblings, and i just hate it. ive grown up to be somewhat of a normal human being, even with depression n all, i wish i could say the same for my siblings. i wont go into personal details i dont want to dox my family. so lets get started with the brother who is the second oldest, he has the mental capacity of a 3 year old, he throws temper tantrums all the time, swears at and hits my mother. next in line we have the oldest sister of my family, today shes shown how weak she is, there was a competition at her school and she came last. she was telling a story down stairs and she said she came last like 5 times (in a row) so my stepdad jokingly said ""you came in last?"" she then proceeded to run upstairs slam her door and starts crying(pretty sure it was fake crying for attention) when i walked past her room my mum was in there and all i heard from my sister was blatant lies. (btw my mum heard and saw everything so i dont know why she was lying) yeah, onto the next one. my brother who is definitely got something wrong with him. he cries constantly, over literally nothing, you could poke him lightly and he would cry. he also shits himself constantly like atleast 3 times a week. he doesnt even notice it either (oh btw his age is in the double digits) then i have two little sisters, too young to notice any major abnormalities. the youngest of the two is probably the most mature out of my siblings(except from me of course) the other sister is a little brat though. now, enough about my siblings. my stepdad woooooo, oh my god do i have a story to tell. he has temper tantrums all the time if its something one of the kids done, a game he played etc. he tries to act all high and mighty all the time. it actually angers me cus he also has the mental capacity of a child. i feel like hes in the middle of transforming into a female, cus its like hes on his period constantly. my mother is actually normal though, which (thank the lord) is good. me, i guess im not normal, im not abnormal though so i guess im just in the limbo of normality. forgot to mention that none of my siblings have learning disabilities or anything, aparrently theyre all quite school smart. thats not to say that people with learning disabilities arent smart, im just saying. so yeah, tl;dr: depression has lead me down a good road that has increased how healthy my brain is, even if that ive had to suffer in the process.",2018-07-04 17:55:47,BigSuperXdJeff,1

(if anyone has read this far i applaud your efforts)if i told my mother she would probably be nice about it, hopefully. my stepdad on the other hand, might not take it very well. just thinking about all of this it feels like my heart is going to pop, i mean college is nice and all, but its really started getting to me. last year the tutors were nice, and i could kinda keep up with the workload. this year tutors have started being right assholes, i can keep up with the work but its basically the same shit from the previous course i took. ive gotten so bored of it. basically all thats keeping me from leaving is 1 person that i go to the shops with almost every day( at college) we have an idea to take a college grant, or some sort of grant so we can set up our own pet shop, thats a nice idea. but i doubt i could be of any help to him. if just bring him down. im pretty sure ive tod him about my depression, and hes kept the same as he always has, which i find very nice, but also weird. cus most other people tend to be more wary of me, or leave. hes just like yeh whatever hes still a person. it actually comforts me every time im alone with him. theres another guy im friends with i guess, but hes a right cunt(ironic how im being a 2 faced ass to him right now)its 1:37 in the morning right now, and instead of sleeping, im writing this shitty essay of a rant. i could also be doing the tons of work i have but i cba. i really need some help. but i cant ask it from anyone, cus it will make them hate me, like it always has done. i think i really jus tneed more people to talk to. cus everyone has their own lives and i just feel bothersome. i have 3 people i truly trust with all my heart. 1 of them has a control freak girlfriend, 1 of them lives in a diffenent country and the other is the one previously mentioned. i dont like messaging first because i always feel like its at a bad time, or at an important time or them. i really should stop ranting now. 1:41 at night.need to wake up in 5 hours and a bitif anyone would like to give some advice or just talk to me, do it on my snaochat, cus for some reason i dont get notifications from reddit (dombozorino)",2018-03-06 03:41:53,BigSuperXdJeff,1

78rosd,relationships,depression,"17 yr old guy and have never had a real girlfriend. the reason i say a real girlfriend is because my ""ex"" cheated and dumped me after one week. ive also recently been chatting to someone online and we were very in love buuuut they ghosted me because they were bored of me. this honestly sucks.the reason i want a girlfriend is to fill the null void inside my soul. i have like 2 friends that im satisfied with, but i only ever talk to them online. im okay with who i am and what i want to do (kinda) i just need someone to be close with to share each others lives. im taking a college course in animal management(its a highly female dominated course) and i hope that at least 1 out of the 20 females in my class like me, because i have my eyes on someone. the real thing is though, is i just think i look like a right loser. i act childish and im a cunt, im not attractive and my personality isnt the greatest. plus being bullied for like 15 years of my life because of my appearance doesnt help. i am a really nice person i feel like, but i just come across as a dick. im socially awkward and dislike talking or making moves. i have too high a standard for what i am, im aiming for a 9/10 lets say, but myself i am probably like a 2/10.i dont expect any replies i just want to rant.",2017-10-26 02:34:47,BigSuperXdJeff,1
75nymf,feeling better,depression,"not to sound like an ass or anything but im slowly making my way downtown walking fast out of depression. last year i was bad, but now im becoming less of an introvert. still suffering emotionally because there is still have two huge holes inside of me that im saving for the right people (close friend and significant other). i have 3 people on my free demo trial, 1 of them are very close to beating the close friend demo. but once that hole has been filled i still have a major problem with getting a gf, no girl likes me, some have tried but they all just leave because they cant handle me and my state. (mid writing i realise that i started this nice and now just is depressing)i dont even have standards anymore, i just want someone to love and help me. professionals dont help, family wont help and friends cant help.

721pw8,*that* feeling,depression,"do you ever get *that* feeling when you just feel meh. just, like meh. oh look some person was murdered, meh. hey you, you wanna come outside with us, meh. just meh. like imagine the emoji movie, and youre an actual meh. i dont know how to explain it, but nothing that happens will change my meh mood. i can stop myself feeling meh for a little bit by drawing or playing games. but whenever i stop, i just dont know what to do with myself. id just stare at a wall and get irritated. then vent out all that irritation on one of the 3 people i hold dear to myself. and out of those three ive only expressed myself fully to only one of them. whenever i do i feel like such a burden. then i start overthinking. wishing i never got irritated. wishing i dont push them away. wishing i kept close instead of keep my distance. however, the people i do express my true feelings. they leave. they just go. out of the bunch of people ive told only 1 has stayed. i only primarily look out for number 1(me) but then i just feel like a selfish ass. no matter what i do i just insult myself and cut the wounds deeper(metaphorically speaking) i keep telling myself one more day, but now its just gotten to the point that i keep saying just one more hour. one more minute. nothing i do satisfies me. never. and i just cant. venting my problems on here isnt the best for my health either. cus it just fuels the hate for myself. really i just wish to disappear. for anyone whos actually read this i feel sorry for you, im sorry for having you read this.",2017-09-24 02:30:26,BigSuperXdJeff,1

accycg,"the strangest thing about moving past my depression and suicidal ideation is that all of a sudden i cry during movies and tv, even during happy parts that are particularly touching.",depression,"i used to never cry at all and used to feel very little emotion bar anger at particularly nasty villains but ive noticed in the past year ive become very emotionally fragile when watching tv or movies with particularly emotional scenes.this goes for movies i havent seen in a while. for instance, i was just rewatching the harry potter movies over christmas with my family and i cried during maybe 3 or 4 of them. not blubbering, but i had to wipe my eyes as slyly as possible so my younger siblings who i was babysitting wouldnt notice. i dont remember feeling this affected by media as much in a very long time.its a strange phenomenon because i *feel* much stronger emotionally and *far* better at coping with things in my everyday life. its a fantastic feeling to actually *have* feelings once more. life used to seem so bleak and pointless.sidenote: for anyone wondering how i got passed my issues, i attended cbt with an excellent therapist to help deal with my crippling social anxiety disorder. also my physician swapped me to a california rocket fuel regimen (predominantly generics if the pharmacist had them in stock) from my previous fluozetine/prozac. this didnt seem to take initially but a heavier dosage appears to have done the trick with no side effects.i used to be a good student and got into medical school off the back of this. unfortunately my depression got the best of me when i became surrounded by high achievers and struggled to keep up. my confidence in my academic ability kept me going for years whilst my self esteem outside of academia was in the toilet. when this confidence disappeared, i had nothing to keep me going and i had to take several years away from university during this period but ive since returned to my medical education and just received some excellent news in the form of christmas exam results.there is light at the tunnel. please dont give up. i was in touch with euthanasia services at my lowest point after several failed attempts on my life (saved through the heroic actions of others). life can be a wonderful place if you get the help you need to get you past your darkest hours.happy new year.",2019-01-04 03:39:51,LegitCockroach,1
