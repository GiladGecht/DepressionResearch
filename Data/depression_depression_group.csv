7wqgjn,"31yo, m, suddenly stricken with anxiety and infrequent panic attacks — looking for recommendations",Anxiety,"i’ve carried normal stress like most people these days, but a week or two before christmas 2017, i started having anxiety. at first, i genuinely thought i was having heart/cardiac related issues. i went to see two cardiologists who both said they believed i was healthy (based on ekgs and standard examination). some people kept suggesting it was anxiety but i refused to believe it — this felt like something **physically** wrong with me. i honestly, to this day, can’t tell you what triggered all of this, but since it all started i’ve had at least one instance where i was lying in bed next to my wife and feeling like my world was ending or imploding in on me. there have been moments where, had i really let myself succumb to my emotions, i could have probably been sobbing (with no real explanation or reason for it). i’ve had my blood tested and my free testosterone is only slightly under normal range, so i can’t imagine it would have this large of an impact on me. i can’t tell you whether i have anxiety because i believed i had a heart-related issue, or if i began feeling chest/ heart issues *because* of anxiety. it’s all been very confusing to me but i’m at the point where i feel like i need to try some form of medication. i tried l-theanine as my first trial, but i found this to be ineffective. does anyone have any recommendations for natural remedies that actually work (before i go to my primary doctor and request a rx)? about ten years ago, i had a doctor tell me that she believed i was depressed — and i very well may have been because i was 23 and having a very rough time figuring out what to do with my life — she ended up prescribing a few different ssris for me to try out. i ultimately stopped taking them because a) one of them made me feel hungover each morning and another one gave me sexually related side effects, and b) at some point, i figured out how to deal with my shit on my own and found a way to be happy again without medication. **tl;dr** - does anyone have any recommendations for natural remedies that actually work (before i go to my primary doctor and request a rx)? and are there any prescriptions that my fellow gentlemen have taken that haven’t given them any side effects?",2018-02-11 05:31:51,Azrael351,1
apkwhz,i suck at interviews,offmychest,i have had so many in the past. some jobs when offered the position i was so happy like “wow they must have liked me”. then upon going there on the first day i find out they’ve hired about 15 other people. obviously they were just hiring anyone. sometimes i give a really good interview and really feel like i got a good chance then get turned down. i think there’s only been one job i’ve got which i was the only candidate chosen. all the other jobs they hired practically everyone. it’s not great to hear when you have low self esteem. it gives my ego a real hit as i practice so hard for every interview. i just feel like it’s down to my personality. maybe i’m not a likeable enough person or something. it’s not like i’m going for jobs out of my depth. they’re for minimum wage type jobs. i’m 29 for christ sakes. usually they’ll say i gave a good interview and some generic reason why i wasn’t chosen like i didn’t have relevant experience. i was told i didn’t get a job as a barista because there was others with more experience even though i’ve been working in cafes for over a year. i have had some mental health issues which i guess when mentioned might not work in my favour. but this has been going on way before that. i have an interview soon for a financial administrator which i feel is a respectable position but i’m worried my recent experience will work against me. when they know i’m 29 years old and have made no progress in my career.,2019-02-11 22:55:55,Bipolarapparently,1
aotzy5,how unhappy do you have to be to be suicidal?,depression,"i’m not suicidal but i don’t really care too much about living a long life. i have no ambition and no long term goals. work is the bane of my life and i’ll likely have to do it until i die. i don’t have any interesting hobbies or passions about anything. i don’t like myself very much. i don’t want to die now but ideally maybe in my 60s. with my lifestyle it could happen sooner than that. but yeah it’s a genuine question because i hear people all the time mention how they’ll kill themselves. i think a lot of people throw this term around a lot maybe but don’t mean it. i might hate myself but i don’t hate my life. i’m always worried about future like financial stuff mainly. i only care about surviving while i can and if i can do that comfortably then great. some stuff in my life is good. i have mental health money, i have a gf, and i have family and somewhat of a social life although it’s rare i actually go out at all these days. anyone else in a similar boat?",2019-02-09 18:48:49,Bipolarapparently,1
aoamyd,not sure if i wear a mask or where this even comes from,depression,to some people i’m probably pretty confident and happy. i can joke around enjoy stuff. i am high functioning. i’m not currently working but it’s not an issue as i have money coming in and i’m looking for work now. i have a girlfriend and a few friends i’m really good at being myself around. from time to time i let out a really pathetic side to me. as a man i don’t want to be seen as a ‘snowflake’ my sensitive side usually comes online. i don’t really have a great online presence on any forum or anything. but i do use many platforms for like life advice or reassurance or to complain about my situation whatever it is at the time. i also do it to my mum a lot. maybe i am autistic or something but words seem to come out. i don’t feel happy or sad but i must have some emotions deep inside that i must bottle up. it’s like i just go on random rants about quite embarrassing or uninteresting issues. i become very self absorbed and i don’t know why i do it. i don’t really know how else to explain it. maybe i’m just childish or maybe i’m just seriously fucked up,2019-02-08 02:20:30,Bipolarapparently,0
anl6g3,need to stop self pitying,depression,"i need to stop self pitying or contemplating my situation. i am not severely depressed. i feel addicted to feeling sorry for myself though. i just need to go on a rant sometimes. i start picking apart my life bit by bit and i like to share online a lot of to my family. i know most people couldn’t give a fuck about my story. i guess i was a bit of a badass/lad at school but now i’m not. i feel washed up since school. right now it’s getting to me that i don’t work. i have disability money but i’m concerned that it will stop soon because i’m better mentally recently. i am looking for a job but every day i have to think about it or talk about it to someone. i worry i won’t hold down a job because i’ve usually just quit because i dread it so much. this is just an example of things i worry about. sometimes when i’m really in self pitying mood i will say i have no personality and other horrible things about myself. i have a girlfriend but i keep this under wraps when she’s around. i don’t really feel like my mood is that lowgenerally. my life could be a lot worse. they say self pity is addictive so perhaps that’s it. i can make interesting conversation and be witty when i want to be. i am not as sociable as i used to be. i’m a lot less outgoing than i used to be too. but time to time my mood will be in deep analytical mode. i feel like venting my problems or so called problems will alleviate some of it somehow. like someone will say something magical to make my situation better. i want to improve but it always seems like my personality holds me back. i worry that this is my life in 5th gear as good as i will ever be, i have a girlfriend but i feel like deep down i’m a bit of a loser still. if i can hold down a job i guess on the outside i’m not missing much. i don’t think self pitying is really me as it is something i picked up on in recent years. i used to self pity or give that impression only to family. someone told me to seek help online and i’ve become addicted to it. i don’t do it like everyday but now and again it feels good to vent. when i’m manic i just act plain weird too. i know a lot of people act a bit cooky when manic but mines different. it’s like i’m a bit of an animal. i will say horrible things to people. sometimes i say things that don’t even make sense or do things that don’t make sense. i can also post excessively on facebook lots of cringeworthy unintelligible shit. i feel like this has slightly ruined my reputation further. anyway anyone got any tips to stop these moods i can find myself getting into? or what’s even causing it? i don’t believe i have depression because a. i could write a really sad post online where the words just splurge out then get a phone call from someone and be perfectly chirpy and b. i don’t really get long periods of it. my mood can change throughout the day. i don’t even feel sad but i guess i have a lot of negative underlying beliefs about myself that i just need to spill to someone. it feels so good to let it out. but i don’t know why i do it",2019-02-06 03:11:04,Bipolarapparently,1

9lxzcx,"i'm having great difficulty with relationships and always look at the negative, and bad. i'm currently very stressed and anxious (more details inside)",mentalhealth,"hi everyone. im male, 19, from england. ive always had problems with relationships starting with my first at the age of around 15. everything starts off wonderful, but as i grow more attached, i start getting very depressed. ill ask all sorts of questions, such as have you ever smoked, drugs, gotten drunk, fornication, etc. ill get severely depressed if i get an answer i dont like (i must say i never ever get angry at anyone, i know the problems with me). even when it comes to games, or app games (flappy bird when that was common, piano tiles, etc.) if im being beaten, i have to keep playing until i win or ill get severely depressed, and feel worthless. this is how it was with my first relationship, until my feelings virtually went for her entirely. she ended up being literally crazy though so it didnt end up mattering too much, haha. unfortunately though, my 2nd relationship when i was 18 was much better and worse at the same time. i started a long distance relationship with someone. we had everything in common, still do. she was a little older than me. i still asked the same questions, and every answer was what i wanted to hear, (we were both born jehovahs witnesses which may be the reason why i have such strong feeling about those sorts of questions). however, she did watch a lot of movies, which is fine, but that included violent and horror movies, which again, i got severely depressed about. i would search for films and ask her if shes seen it, which she usually had. again, i would get depressed. we played piano tiles, i got obsessed, i would constantly check all her scores and make sure she wasnt winning. if she was, id have to play until i did better, if i couldnt, id feel worthless. she was however, everything i ever wanted. she was perfect for me. we spoke for for what must have been thousands of hours, sent over 250,000 messages to each other over the course of a couple of years. after a year of being together though, my feelings began to fade, even though i knew she was perfect. it was almost as if i wanted the challenge of starting a relationship, i dont know. around when my stress and depression from being so obsessed started, my physically health really went bad. i suffered from constant nausea, some days i couldnt eat anything, and that has continued until now. even though we were amazing friends, we decided it might be best to call things off as i was always negative about everything. we didnt talk for around 9 months, until a few days ago when i messaged her again. shes still a beautiful person, amazing friend, and would do anything for me. however, she now has a bf, and is living with him, which im really struggling with. i believe i still have feelings for her, which is really difficult for me. my physical health is starting to get worse because im thinking about her living with him, having sex, and even though i know there isnt really anything wrong with that, my stupid mind is really not allowing me to believe that. my physical health is starting to get worse, my feelings for her are starting to get stronger again, but i know ill be depressed and anxious and make the same mistakes as always whatever happens. i dont want to lose her again, as a friend or anything else, because weve both missed each other a lot, and it wouldnt be fair on her either, but i cant allow my physical health to get as bad as it was again. shes genuinely perfect, beautiful, and she would never do a bad thing to anyone, which is why i hate my mind so much for not only ruining it in the first place, but for getting me feeling this way now, both with my feelings for her, and the depression im getting into again. if i forget about her and start a relationship in the future, the same will happen, those questions, anxiety, depression, and obsession. im sorry if this was difficult to read but i truly dont know how to write it any other way. thank you for any help!

aimki4,one of my roommates obnoxiously loves disney and i’m honestly starting to lose the patience for it.,offmychest,"ever since i was a kid, i’ve always hated disney, both as a creative studio and as a corporation. i’ve tried to give them a chance, i’ve watched many of their movies as a child, and growing up in la my parents often took me and my little brother to disneyland. i don’t want to go into detail about *why* i hate them so much because everyone in grade school always provoked that argument out of me, because every disney fan i’ve met seems to think they’re always right and have tried to get me to suddenly love disney harder than a preacher shoving the bible down an atheist kid’s throat. and the harder they try to convince me, the more i end up hating disney as a whole. so please, *please* don’t try to convert me into a disney lover in the comments. i don’t like disney movies (with the sole exceptions of wall e and stitch), so please let me dislike them in peace.well, after putting up with these arguments in grade school, i have found myself to be cursed once again, because before i moved into my apartment this year, one of my roommates asked if her friend could move in with us. her explanation of this friend was “she’s really sweet and she loves disney.” now, i’m not about to judge someone for loving something i don’t like, different people like different things, and that’s ok. i felt for her friend because not being able to find housing is tough, and she wasn’t even gonna move in the bedroom i was in. so of course i said yes, but i refused to tell her or anyone else that i hated disney. making that mistake in grade school quickly turned into a competition to see who could get me to like disney first, and it made me even more sick of the corporation. i didn’t want to go through with that again.but holy fuck that was a huge mistake.despite the other four of us not being as crazy of disney fans as her, she keeps decorating the apartment with disney stuff. she writes walt disney quotes on the living room whiteboard. she made monster inc cutouts for the front door. she drew pictures of dumbo and eeyore bathing for the bathroom. i felt irked because she’s not even asking anyone if they’re ok with it, she’s just placing decoration after decoration with no word until every goddamn room in the apartment feels like the disney store. and i just can’t forget about it. but i tell myself, “damn, she’s put so much effort into this. she’ll be graduating this year. if i can stay patient, i’ll let her have her fun, and then there will be no conflict. how bad can it get?”and then right now, at 4:18 in the morning, as i got up from bed to take a late night piss in the only bathroom we have, my drowsy self gets rudely awakened by a fucking shower curtain of the disney castle.fucking. *hell.*i don’t know if it’s because i’m tired or something, but that really, really drew the line for me. don’t people ask before just placing an eyesore decoration in an already tiny *public* room? look, i really fucking love pokémon, and i have many obnoxious pokémon decorations in my room, but they *stay* in my room. because that is a *private* room. i don’t force people to put pokémon in their everyday lives. so why the fuck does disney have to be in my everyday life?! every time i go unlock the front door, every time i take a piss, every time i wash my face or sit on the couch in the living room. disney is there. they’re already everywhere. they own half the movies and have taken part in most of the others. fuck off from my life already!it doesn’t help that i’m *already* being patient with this roommate with other things. many things bother her, so she has a rack of her own private dishware and brings in her own coffee machine and stuff while the rest of us share because there is honestly no room in this small kitchen for five people to have their own set of things. she moves other people’s things around because she doesn’t agree where they are instead of telling the roommate to move them. she is insanely picky about little things like which appliances get to be on the counter, how we use aluminum foil, where we put stuff, etc. she told me to put my george foreman grill away in my already small pantry space but she gets to have her own keurig coffee machine on the counter?! this isn’t only her apartment. holy fuck. but i get her reasoning, i started using my own dish sponge, soap and towels because the public sponge/towels are always dirty and for some reason everyone else dilutes the dish soap and i can’t get shit cleaned with water soap. so again, i keep my patience.aside from the disney shit, i communicate things i have a problem with because she sure as hell doesn’t have a problem with doing that either, but she won’t change. fuck, if i even told her about my problems with the disney stuff she’ll be even more fed up with me. i’ve been lucky enough to never have an issue with a roommate before, and my other three roommates and i are on chill terms. and i really want to be on chill terms with this fifth roomie as well. she isn’t all bad, she gave me a futurama poster when she found out i liked the show. but damn. my patience is starting to run thin. i’m even starting to question myself, whether i’m in the wrong or not. fuck, i just really needed to let this out, because frankly i feel like i’m not allowed to say this anywhere else.thank you for listening. maybe i can try to get back to sleep now.",2019-01-22 14:56:10,AwesomeDragon101,1
a3l1ci,"honestly, i’m ready to collapse at any moment.",offmychest,"i know this is a stressful week for many of us. finals are coming up soon. i’ve been on campus for over twelve hours a day to go to classes, do labs, and study for the last few tests before finals come over. the camp fire caused school to close for two weeks, and because of that many professors have shoved even more material towards the last week of schooling because they cannot afford to miss that many lectures in a quarter system. on this week alone i had to do two massive homework assignments, two lab reports, a lab session that was two labs in one to make up for what we missed, and study for a test in two days. half the material on that test is shit that wasn’t covered in lecture, shit we have to teach ourselves because the prof didn’t want to accept that school was cancelled and gave us a ton of difficult material to self study to make up for that lost time. i can teach myself many things, but not ochem. and that’s just for my organic chemistry class, whose final is three days after that last test. i also have a biology lab practical exam tomorrow morning and a paper due for my ge class, among other things. i have no idea when i’m gonna be able to study for my finals.honestly, i’ve forgotten how to take care of myself. i’m living off of energy drinks because daily 8ams are taking a toll on me. i’m not getting sleep, i’m not showering. my eyes hurt to the point where i had to take a couple short naps today. every day it feels like forever before i can get home. i want to pass organic chemistry so badly, i really don’t want to retake it. and the professor doesn’t fucking curve anything except for the final exam despite the class average being a d or lower. i’m not even thinking about my other classes at this point. which is sad because i enjoyed my other classes. it just sucks that because of the stupid fires, most professors have no choice but to make the last two weeks of an already fast-paced quarter system even more stressful.at least i know i’m not alone. every other student i’ve talked to feels the same about that class. the homework, despite its whole purpose being to help learn the material, feels like another test because it punishes you for every attempt you make at an answer. the system is fucked, we’re all driven to the point where we’re laughing due to loss of sanity. at least i haven’t met a person who is confident about that class. maybe the curve on the final exam will save our asses.to the professors of my ans and ge classes, thank you guys for actually giving a shit about student health. giving us information about the crisis while we were house-ridden and constantly reminding us to take care of ourselves. i swear to god, it is so freaking hard to find stem professors that actually give a shit. so thank you guys for offering a shred of humanity.i’m gonna go study. fuck my life.",2018-12-06 07:38:59,AwesomeDragon101,1

9lhdik,"last night, i was thanked because my venting sounded “good.”",offmychest,"the mind has odd ways of manifesting thoughts into your head. last night, i left class at 8pm, walking across campus with the cool breeze stroking my face. my heart felt constricted, my thoughts racing. unwelcome feelings entered in unexplained ways for unknown reasons, and my mind soon numbed me. the only way i could escape this numb state is by quelling the voices in my head with music.the melodies that enter my head are arbitrary, yet they always follow the same pattern: a 2-5-2-3-5 chord progression. i don’t know why my creativity is so limited, but that’s the only way my mind feels like it’s properly expressing itself. whatever sequence of notes decides to crowd my head will do so on repeat, over and over again, until my mind is fogged into an endless and frustrating cycle...i could no longer avoid the war behind the negative voices and distracted music. i needed a release, so i wandered into the one building on campus that had a piano.it was 8:15, nobody was playing. the building was almost empty, which meant fewer people could see me at my most vulnerable state. with the piano as my therapist, i spoke my mind in those keys that night.only to be interrupted mid-session with a thank you for the beautiful music.i wished my shyness didn’t overcome me. i wished i didn’t feel so naked, so horribly raw. i did not know how to reply, for i do not play music. i have one fully written song; the rest is improvised filler. the filler that only barely prevents my racing thoughts from being destructive, the same six broken chords supporting it. anybody can feel how repetitive my playing is. i use the same broken chords, similar melodies, i only occasionally change my scale to spice things up but i would not call what i play “entertaining.” calming? sure. therapeutic? ok. but only because it was already in my head, and i am merely putting it out there. if somebody were to watch you break your thoughts down with a therapist, they would not call it majestic, would they? for this reason, i never play in front of others, i dislike performing. yet last night, two people at two different times thanked me for playing.to those students, i am sorry i do not know how to feel. i cannot play anywhere without being approached and i am not sure how to react. i am glad my ranting through music did not disturb your studies. i’m glad that my coping mechanism simultaneously brought peace to not only myself, but to you as well. i just hope that i will never disappoint you by my lack of songs, for i am not a musician.i am just a depressed person with a piano.",2018-10-05 03:09:36,AwesomeDragon101,1

9bp7bl,"by having the happiest season in a while, i have killed my only way to vent.",offmychest,"this time last year, i’d sit in front of my piano.my mind, my heart would feel bottled up with emotions i could not share without a filter, emotions i was unable to express even in drawing. and then one man told me i could write music, so i poured my soul out onto the keyboard.music has a way of taking feelings that are inexplainable in words and communicate them in a way that could only be described as obscure and beautiful. i used to take the worst of my depression, shut out the surroundings with headphones, and vent through creating music. it was like a vocal journal log that only i could understand, what sounded like music was the way i recorded those specific heart-wrenching feelings of the past. but nobody could tell how screwed up i was.i never showed anyone what i created, save for one person. and even he only knew a fraction of what i wrote because i was ashamed of my own music. a creator who hates their own creation, i didn’t think my music was half as great as what people told me. i kept what i wrote hidden from the world and rarely wrote what i played.but then i left home for a year and was separated from my instrument. i could not afford my own piano, and the time i had in my university’s music room was extremely limited. my time writing music has become more distant and more scarce. and i slowly began forgetting my theory.college has been amazing. i have made new friends and pursued my long-wished studies of animal science. i could not be happier, and with joy i had fewer feelings to ventilate, and i slowly lost my reason to write music. i already am terrible at writing efficiently, i only ever finished one song. a wonderful song that i can never match. and the rest are fragments i can never complete because my writing and playing is only a shadow of what it once was. i was my only critic when i was great at it, and because of that i killed the only remedy to my depression. i despise myself for it, and i’m trying to play music once more but i am unable to turn my newfound frustration into something beautiful. i lost that ability and i never got a chance to value it. i used to feel satisfaction and release from turning my demons into something people can enjoy, and even then i was too hard on myself so i hardly showed what i wrote to anyone. and now that i’ve lost that skill, i’ll never create anything again. i have so many songs left unfinished. even my sketchbook is filled with half finished drawings. i’d give anything, *anything* to be good at art again.",2018-08-31 04:02:50,AwesomeDragon101,1

aos7kv,my dad's girlfriend purposefully reported my dad for fraud for having me and my little brother on his health insurance.,offmychest,"this is a long ass story and im writing it on mobile, so if it looks funky, my apologies. ill answer the question most people probably have at first. how could your dad be reported for fraud for having his children on his health insurance? the man im referring to as my ""dad"" is not legally or biologically my father. he is a man my mom married when i was 3 years old and filled the empty father figure position my brother and i had, happily. i am forever grateful to have had a father figure throughout my childhood, and i know my brother is too. my mom and him split up when i was about 12 years old. for anybody whose wondering im a 20 year old female and my brother is 18. this story is very long. but i seriously need to get this off my chest. my dad has been in a relationship with this woman for about 5 years now (maybe a little less.) i was never really a huge fan of her, but i was always nice and respectful towards her. the first times she started to bother me was when i was around 17 years old. my dad has always said to me ""if you ever need anything, let me know."" so when i was 17 i had to take night classes for school(another long story, but i skipped a bunch of classes and had to make up for it in night classes) i didnt get my license until i was 18 years old, and since my mom had to work 2 jobs, one of them being at night, i didnt always have a secure ride to my night classes. so on the days i couldnt find a ride from friends, i would call up my dad and ask him for a ride. no big deal considering thats how my dad and i have always operated. i need something, i let him know. so his girlfriend started saying shit like ""oh why is she asking such short notice, she didnt know she needed a ride yesterday?!"" which is a reasonable thing to get annoyed by, i guess, but my dad has never been one for planning. he doesnt know anybodys birthday, lol i he literally thought he turned 49 this year, but hes 48. thats just how he is, yanno? hes never been an organized ""oh lets plan a day to hang out"" no, before he lived with his girlfriend, when i wanted to see my dad, i would just show up at his house. he never cared. but his girlfriend is very organised and likes plan shit and whatever. so that was the first incident that pissed me off, and there have been many, but for the purpose of making sure this post isnt ridiculously long, im going to fast forward. in april of my senior year, my mom quit her job that was making his extremely fucking depressed. she was working 2 jobs, but she quit her full time, and started working her second job full time. but she only had one income. eventually she got an eviction notice so we had to suddenly move to a different town in with her boyfriend. we asked our dad if we could use his address so we can continue going to the same school, considering i was he graduating in 2 months and my brother was graduating the following year (he moved into his girlfriends house, which is in the same town my brother and i went to school in.) my dad said it was okay for us to use his address. he failed to tell his girlfriend about this, because shes made if obvious in the past she has something against me and my brother. i speculate its because were not biologically his children and shes jealous because were another womans children. but anyways she ends up getting some of my mail delivered to her house and she was not happy. she contacted my mom saying how this is lying and she wants nothing to do with it, telling my mom she should of considered me and my brother before she got an eviction notice. which is understandable. anyways my dads girlfriend  starts treating to tell the school that we dont live in the town anymore, which would suck because my brother and i had gone to school there our entire lives. i started getting involved with arguing with my dads girlfriend because i was kind of sick of her shit at this point. she started to threaten to report my dad for fraud for having us on his health insurance. wtf right?? my dad has always told all of us(he has 3 kids of his own too, my ""step"" siblings) that he wants us on his health insurance until were 26 years old. (thats the longest a parent can have children on their health insurance in my america. my state at least.) and what kind of person threatens something like that??? anyways that all happened about a year ago.fast forward to now. the first month of september my dad called my and started telling me that ""things are going to be changing."" i wasnt quite sure of what he meant, but to me it sounded like he was leaving his girlfriend. which i have been hoping he would do for years now. but he hasnt. fast forward to mid october he contacts my mom( on a secret phone he has to hide from his girlfriend because his regular phone is in her name and she blocked my moms number on it) and tells her that his work is cracking down on the legitimacy of insurance and that my brother and i are no longer going to be able to be on his insurance. he said we should be good until the end of the year. mid october. fast forward to now.  my mom got a notice from my dentist that my my insurance had been cancelled on september 1st. wtf?!?!?! and my dad didnt tell us until mid october. and i specifically remember that my dad called me the first week of september to tell me things were going to be changing. it makes a lot more sense to me that his girlfriend fucking reported my dad for fraud, just like she threatended. and i found out from my aunt( my dads sister) that my dad had left his girlfriend recently and went to my aunts house. my dads girlfriend showed up there and waiting outside in the driveway in her car until my dad got back in. just fucking waited there. i dont know why nobody called the fucking cops. theres not much of a conclusion her other than my dad is wasting his life with a fucking sociopath who has a resentment towards me and my brother. id be interested in hearing other perspectives and let me know if you have questions because there is so much other bullshit i left out for the sake of keeping this as short as possible.

9tyu2o,here is some advice ... might help.,depression,"i used to be very depressed and did a little research and made some changes, and i wanted to offer a little help to aid you to get through your day.1. people who are suicidal often dont want to kill themselves, but rather they just want their pain inside to end. when you get to that point, talk to others. understand that you just want this pain to end. coming to terms with that pain and accepting that pain, will put you in a place to find coping mechanisms. things like exercise, diet, caffeine, short and long term goals are good at coping with your daily depression. they dont cure it, only help cope. seeing a doctor might help you find ways to treat the depression.2. social media and its role on influencing you. when the mtv beach house first appeared, young adults went nuts because they wanted to live rent free with hot models in miami. unfortunately thats a fantasy world for the very rich and 99% of us dont really live like that. instagram is full of models who travel the world and go on adventures, and for those of us who work 9-5 at starbucks, its often making us hate ourselves because we feel like a failure that we are not living this amazing life. its very detrimental on your psyche to see this over and over and over. you need to understand that everyone has bad break ups, everyone cries, everyone has bad days. the hardest diamond can still break. 99.9% of us dont live that life.3. understanding envy, and directional goals. so, pre-internet, i would visit my friends house, and he would have some cool new toy or some cool new thing. he and i playing with whatever video game system or action figure made me happy, and i wanted one too. i had envy. i would go to museum gift shops, and want the cool statue of dinosaurs because i wanted to share it my friend and be like look at this cool dino i got. there is a lot that goes into envy and whats cool and the world has changed so much now. for starters, people dont go over each others houses like before. people dont buy stuff like before, and share like before. friendships are different now also.  here is an example of envy. for example, martha stewart did a show on tv where every day she made women around the us feel guilty that they werent a real woman because they couldnt cook like her, and could afford the blender, or oven, or crock pot, or whatever else she was selling. people got depressed watching her show and when she did jail time for insider trading the public loved it because of how awful she made them feel. youtube videos are often carefully crafted to sell products, and part of that is to guilt you or psychologically make you want to get something. you are overwhelmed daily with 2,000 advertisements for millions of products. all of this contributes to feelings of inadequacy and depression. i encourage all of you to write down things you want and try and determine why you want these things and if you need them or if you were heavily marketed to.hope my advice helps even one person. keep on fighting!",2018-11-04 01:35:15,tommygunz007,1

5cw6sa,don't feel guilty about being depressed; for me it was a reaction to the insecurity of society.,depression,"theres nothing wrong with any of us. not a thing.were all human beings, and were all imperfect. for years i made the mistake of thinking that productive, or so-called successful people, are actually winners. its this western society we live in: it wants to use and abuse you for its own ends, so from the moment youre born it stresses the importance of work to you. of productivity. of looking respectable. of chasing the dream. it wants you to buy this, behave like that, say this and criticize that. it does this because it wants things that you have - it wants your labour, your money, and most importantly it wants your personality. are we really winners if we sell ourselves to it? no. we should pursue individual satisfaction.it wants to take your personality and mould it into whatever it wants. it doesnt care if you love, for example, music. it doesnt care how sincerely you love the act of playing/creating, it only cares about how much it can make from you. a label wont sign you unless you make music that will sell. its frowned upon to be in a band and to write songs and not aim to make it. open your eyes. this applies to everything around you. society freaks out when you do something truly for yourself. it attacks you; why make music if not to sell it? why write a book if not to sell it? why climb a mountain if not to post a photo online? why spend a few hours alone in the forest, examining different types of flowers/trees/animals? thats weird. right? thats what weve grown up being told. that if youre not going to the gym to keep fit, going out drinking to socialize, going to work for satisfaction, getting married to have kids, that youre weird? that there’s something wrong with you? but why should we have to believe that?so many people are so brainwashed and insecure. social skills are such an effective mask for insecurity. i know so many people who have been in loads of relationships over the years, and have proven that they have no problem finding a new one when one ends, and yet these are horrible, abusive, insecure, insulting, cruel people. but were not like that. people who suffer from depression have so much more empathy than people whove spent their whole lives using everyone around them to feel good about themselves. these people are afraid to stand out. they all have to pretend to be normal every day, and how boring do their lives look?fuck that. do what you want. in my opinion there is no purpose/destiny/fate. i dont feel compelled to do anything, but yet i like to play guitar and record songs in my bedroom. it’s not a passion; i don’t have one. yet i can still get up in the morning and be excited for the day, because i live how i like. sure, i don’t feel destined to do anything but i still like guitar. i still like steak, so i’ll have a steak for dinner. i still like films so i’ll go to the cinema. you see, your dreams may be hurting you. i used to dream of being a world famous musician, and of being a social master. but i realized one day that what i really wanted here was people’s the acceptance, which was never going to happen the way i visualized. reality is so complex, there’s no way that it will ever conform to something that you visualized in your head.the way i see it, you have no control over the world outside of you. everything happens regardless of what you do. you can influence the world, yes, but you can’t control it. likewise, you can’t control the world inside of you either. you can’t choose to not think a thought, or to unthink one once it has been thought. you can’t unfeel an emotion, you can’t unlike something. you can suppress and ignore everything yes, but once again you can’t control it. but you can control your reactions to all this. someone insults you, you don’t have to accept it. sure, the insult occurred, and you heard it and understood it, but it doesn’t have to affect you because you had no control over that person anyway. find happiness in your reactions. see the world in front of you and listen to your internal emotions/thoughts and react how you want. pursue your dreams in the real world, don’t let your perfect visions burn you out because they’re never going to happen the way you envision.i used to feel depressed and weird about not giving a damn about ninety nine percent of what i see around me. but i dont feel weird about it anymore. i realize that society is a deeply insecure thing populated by deeply insecure people who dont want you to have a rich, individual experience. they want to drag you down to their level, where they have to make fun of anyone different, talk about people behind their backs just to have something to talk about, get drunk four nights a week just so they can feel normal. all we want is to be free of depression.for me, this viewpoint has been the beginning of a pathway out. i know that many of you may be a lot more depressed than me, and i understand if this wont work. this might only be my understanding of how to help myself. but look, in brief: society is afraid of people who want to have an individual experience. a lot of depressed people are disillusioned with society, but feel bad for being like this. well, dont feel bad. an individual experience is worth so much more than a mediocre, pre-defined one. want to stay in bed for a day? do if you want to. want to go to the pub? do if you want to. want to go in search of a flower in the forest? do if you want to. but only if you want to. and remember that when someone makes fun of you or mocks you for doing what you wanted to do, that’s just them acting out of insecurity. have your beautiful personal experiences and don’t worry about the insecure society and its insecure people. find your happiness in what you can control and let the moment happen.",2016-11-14 16:27:24,fenix_funk,1
5apb9b,reality hitting me,depression,"this has been a long time coming, but after all these years its finally hitting me how shit my life is.i can barely get up in the morning. my room is an absolute mess which reflects me. when i hear that there are visitors downstairs i dont want to go down. i dont want to put them through my mediocrity. i dont want to make small talk or listen to their stories, but not because theres anything wrong with them; i just wish that i didnt exist. i wish there was no me to come downstairs.i fucked up my college registration and now i might be failing a module, no matter how well i do in it. if this happens, ill have to tell my parents, who will go insane. they take education incredibly seriously and if i were to have to do a repeat they would kill me.im losing my friends. i dont know what to say to anyone anymore. the only thing i can talk about where i have something real to say is mental health, and no one wants to spend a long time talking about that. im scared of going to large gatherings where home isnt within walking distance, because i always end up close to tears with anxiety and need to walk home and go to bed, where i feel even worse for giving in and leaving. i want to cut all ties with my friends and just let them be happy without me. id miss them but id be glad.ive worked in the same job for a year and a half and i dont have a friendly relationship with anyone. they all get on fine except me. i spend the whole day thinking about suicide. i think about suicide a lot. a lot of the time when i unlock my phone in the morning itll still be on the same suicide methods webpage i was reading when i fell asleep the night before. im always exhausted yet i hate going to bed because i dont want the morning to come. when it does come im afraid to leave.i dont know who i am anymore. i used to like things, now ive lost interest but i keep doing the same things because theres nothing else to do. none of my hobbies are social. in my spare time i sit on my bed and stare at the wall and just dream of non-existence. i dont live in a country where you can buy guns but if i did id write notes to everyone i know right now and then kill myself. im not scared of death but i am scared of what would happen if a suicide method went wrong. i dont want to end up even worse off than i am now. i just want it to work.i dont want money, or a job, or even friends. i just want to feel normal but that probably wont happen, so what i really want is to die in my sleep. i want to go into a deep, beautiful sleep and pass away. i dont want anything more than this. there are a lot of things that i would miss. i would miss music, old friends, nature. but none of these things can solve the problem i have and i cant solve it either. i dont want to be like this when im thirty or forty. theres no point in carrying on if this is what my life is going to be.  theres no point. im scared of the world, of being honest, of telling the truth, of being vulnerable, of talking to people, of being depressed, of making promises, of saying yes...of everything. i am depressed and i need help but id rather die and everyone says that they care about me and they do, but its not enough. all the love in the world cant help someone who cant love themselves. i really, really need help. i really, really do.",2016-11-02 13:21:35,fenix_funk,0

(god wants me to do this, aliens are coming, seeing things...).i honestly think that with the right medication and right counseling, people will mental health issues are blessed with hyper awareness of reality. it is not some sort of “super power”. it is just something that we have. we are hyper aware of reality and it makes us go “crazy” as some regular folks would say.mental health is not a joke. we are not crazy. we are not blessed (even tho we could potentially use it for good). we are only burdened with the weight of reality that so many normal people forget.if you just forget for a moment that you are the center of your world and meditate on the fact that we all are extras in someone else’s world, i think that by taking attention off yourself, you will feel less pressure and less anxiety and less depression. i say less... it will never be completely gone. many of is are stuck with a life long struggle. and you have the choice and ability to live a balanced life which is at war with your mind.with the help of medication, counseling, group therapy, music, art, dancing, relationships, god, religion, politics, friends, nature... i believe that you can do this. you can live a good life. you will get better with time.i have a motto: life will eventually get worse, but it will also eventually get better.",2019-01-27 16:21:42,oeimili,0

but i would fantasize a lot about it, wondering how i would do it, who would care, and when the best time to do it would be. i grew up in a strict christian household that forbade just about everything i found joy in. no rock music allowed, no reading my favorite books including harry potter, no playing cards, no watching movies unless the director and cast were devout christians. i was taught to never question god and always obey my father whose word was final. because of this, i learned to never voice my opinions because doing so would often result in insanely long lectures, sometimes lasting half the day, 6+ hours, about how i was wrong and need to listen to him. my mother always followed his say, repressing her own feelings and attitudes for 26 years of their marriage until finally they divorced when i was 11 and all the built-up repression spewed out. my dad was a trucker who was gone a week or 2 at a time, but from 11+ onward most of my memories with them are about them arguing over every single thing imaginable (also, though divorced neither of them could afford to live separately from each other, so this is what i grew up with for the rest of my adolescence). so while my father was entirely tyrannical, my mother justifiably couldnt take it anymore. however, since then she has always had the victim mentality that still continues today. everything is always somebody elses fault, she is never the one to blame, and she will never take responsibility even when she is clearly the cause. when i moved out to attend university, i felt a huge weight was taken off my shoulders but another weight had replaced it. i was away from my familys toxicity, but in my classes i was learning about all this horrible stuff happening in the world which only seemed continual with no sense of relief and no hope of change. i abandoned religion when i was 16, so i couldnt find comfort in god. my social history is that of an introverted-extrovert; i was sociable and happy for the most part, had friends but not really any close friends since moving away from my hometown, and while i genuinely was happy and not completely enveloped in depression, it was also partly a facade for deeper negative emotions i didnt want others to see. overall, for most of my college experience i felt alone with nowhere to really find comfort and possessing a world view that the purpose of life was to try to find a light with a paper bag taped over your head. while for most of my life my livelihood has been in a negative state, recently i can say that all of it has changed. at age 20 i went on a road trip with my brother and during the drive he was trying to tell me to see the beauty of the world and that i shouldnt be so negative, but i wasnt listening. i just quietly dismissed everything he was talking about. when we reached our destination i consented to try mushrooms, and because of this i witnessed a completely different mode of consciousness that finally made me realize the nonsense of my state. i witnessed my first dis-association from my thoughts and finally felt free from this constant burden of mine. this experience opened me up afterwards to see with fresh eyes what i would normally have condemned and left unexplored. i became fascinated with psychology to know why my brain works the way it does, rediscovered meaning through religion (though it is not entirely conventional), and started questioning other cases of how i, myself, was the cause of my own suffering. i finally understood what my brother was talking about during the drive and wept at how i was purposefully blinding myself from seeing the light, only adding more tape to the bag over my head because it was the only thing i knew how to do.i see a lot of posts in here condemning other people for naive comments on how to just be happy. a lot of posts blame other things for their continual state of depression whether it be chemical deficiencies, other people, or societys mold placed over you on how you should be. i am not totally naive to physiological and other biological causes for depression, but i must say i dont think i can ever fully comprehend what its like without personally being affected by it. i understand it to be something way out of peoples conscious control, and for that i could only wish to have more empathy than i do now. however, i have to question is it your identification as the depressed one, the sufferer, the victim maintaining those chemical deficiencies? is it your original world view constructed and reinforced through countless years of conditioning causing this? like my mother, i too identified as the victim until i found the state of consciousness aware of my thoughts, and by being aware of them i was able to dis-associate from them similar to awakening from a dream that had taken place over my entire life.i see a lot of posts desiring to be understood by other people, for a social connection to their deeper layer of unhappiness. to this i say sure, i understand this desire. but are you simultaneously capable of understanding others not in your realm of thinking? we all have our own troubles and pain points, but it seems many of you prioritize your own above others. non-depressed people seem to have no idea what its like to be you, and many of you seem to have a drowners panic looking for a social connection to ease this state of depression youre in, but when a lifeguard comes to offer aid you try drowning him as well.after mushrooms i heard an analogy that depressed people are often like an abused shelter dog. because of its abuse the dog becomes programmed to show its teeth and growl in attempts to defend itself. even after the abuse has stopped, this programming becomes all it knows and the dog will navigate the world snarling in any uncomfortable situation, often causing more beatings that wouldnt have happened otherwise, only giving more reinforcement to snarl. i do not mean to use this as a demeaning analogy or claim that everything is your fault. but that your perpetual unhappiness becomes an endless loop that may have originated totally out of your control in the beginning, perhaps in childhood, but becomes an unnecessary conditioned response maintaining your unhappiness when it no longer should.i am not making this high-effort post to claim myself holier than thou. i am merely questioning if there is any possibility to escape this state of mind if it no longer suits you. if the answer is yes, i believe the answer is out there somewhere for you. even if its not this post, i dont care. i hope it points to a general direction.if the answer is a unanimous no, downvote me, call me out in the comments, ban me from the sub. maybe i will understand that i was incredibly more naive that i presumed. though maybe it takes an outsider to point out your own flaws, maybe even harshly, if you refuse to see them for yourself and take responsibility.for me the answer was right in my face the entire time but i was too preoccupied in my head to even understand it. the answer for me was simply ""to be"" and because of this ""to be happy"".",2019-01-10

989hd1,i cleaned my house for the first time in months.,depression,"i have bipolar with anxiety disorder. i used to go through life with an overall dull feeling on a normal day. when i dropped, i felt like killing myself every day for about a week and a half, then i would really cease to exist. i did the things i was supposed to; but i felt like i wasn’t there. then, came the highs. i would come up from my full existence to feeling astronomical. i could do ten times more than i normally could, i wouldn’t sleep for more than 2-3 hours, and it wasn’t good sleep, but i would only be irritable for about an hour and then have this pissed off energy. i spent money in excess to where i would have to ask my family for help because i would get evicted otherwise.i started on lamictal about two months ago. for the first time in a while, my ‘normal’ existence (feeling like any joy i had was surface level, but numb on the inside), actually felt like it had gone away. i felt vibrant and alive.i then saw my house for what it was, and realized that i had completely blocked out how i was living. there were bags of fast food everywhere. trash and cups and plates that had been used weeks ago were piled up on my side tables, and my clothes were everywhere except the hamper; even in my living room, and on the stairs and in the hallway. there were pans and pots literally stacked and had mold in them; there were maggots in them, too. i started crying. i felt really, truly happy, and then i felt a deep sorrow. it felt like i was mourning the loss of my life. the months that i didn’t really live, but existed only to work, sleep, overfeed myself or starve. i functioned because i had to, not because i had any desire to live.i’m writing this because after i cried, i stared at my wall for about an hour. i was lost in my thoughts and wondering what i should do. the anxiety kicked in. there was so much shit in my house to clean up, and i felt like i wouldn’t get it all done, and that i was disgusting and i couldn’t believe how i was living, and how my poor dog had just been there the entire time living in the filth i let grow.then i stopped. i snapped out of the trance. i went and got some trash bags and some cleaning supplies from down the road, came back and started just throwing shit away. i just finished my downstairs. i have some dishes to do, but i cleaned off all the maggots and eggs and mold and all the trash is gone. i can finally sit in my living room and actually see it and feel okay.i 100% would not have done this without all the therapy, and this drug that i truly believe is a miracle for me. i can see clearly. this isn’t a high, either. i’m tired as hell, and all i want to do is get some rest and snuggle my pup, who had been patiently sitting on the couch while i worked. i just feel good. not ecstatic and not energetic. just good. i never thought i would cherish the feeling of just that. just feeling good. i remember my ex girlfriend, who would come over and rag on me about how my house was dirty and she couldn’t live like that. i tried really hard to keep it clean for her, but i felt like there was a heavy weight on my chest that held me down and said ‘you’re tired. you don’t feel like it. you should just sleep, and clean it later.’ i remember he day she said. ‘well, when does it become an excuse?’tonight made it pretty clear to me that my depression is not an excuse. it’s a disease and a mental illness that sinks into your veins and into your bones, and into your eyes and your back and stomach. you literally feel like you’re sinking slowly into a muddy grave, and you can’t pull yourself out of it because your arms are too heavy with muck.if you’ve gotten through reading all of this, i want you to know something. i have tried to kill myself three times. i am twenty three years old. i used to think, ‘if i can just get through this year, maybe i can tough it out and cope with it, and feel better.’ i tried to. i know others have been successful at it. you can’t get that year back, though. i cannot get back my last ten years of feeling this way. not everything will work for you, but you have to keep trying so you can live. not exist, but really, really live. i think i made that first step tonight. i hope you can make it soon.",2018-08-18 08:51:46,ItsSatineActually,1

aefll3,is this a sub for finding motivation for overcoming depression or a sub to wallow in everyone's relatable experiences?,depression,"im new to this sub but almost all of the posts ive seen are relatable experiences of being in depression, and i have one question for you guys: what is your motivation for joining this sub? are you here because youve given up all hope on finding happiness but find comfort in being around people in the same state of mind as you or are you here with any shred of hope to find a way out? is it your ultimate desire to stay depressed or is there any hope at all

view that the purpose of life was to try to find a light with a paper bag taped over your head. while for most of my life my livelihood has been in a negative state, recently i can say that all of it

to question is it your identification as the depressed one, the sufferer, the victim maintaining those chemical deficiencies? is it your original world view constructed and reinforced through countless years of conditioning causing this? like my mother, i too identified as the victim until i found the state of consciousness aware of my thoughts, and by being aware of them i was able to dis-associate from them similar to awakening from a dream that had taken place over my entire life.i see a lot of posts desiring to be understood by other people, for a social connection to their deeper layer of unhappiness. to this i say sure, i understand this desire. but are you simultaneously capable of understanding others not in your realm of thinking? we all have our own troubles and pain points, but it seems many of you prioritize your own above others. non-depressed people seem to have no idea what its like to be you, and many of you seem to have a drowners panic looking for a social connection to ease this state of depression youre in, but when a lifeguard comes to offer aid you try drowning him as well.after mushrooms i heard an analogy that depressed people are often like an abused shelter dog. because of its abuse the dog becomes programmed to show its teeth and growl in attempts to defend itself. even after the abuse has stopped, this programming becomes all it knows and the dog will navigate the world snarling in any uncomfortable situation, often causing more beatings that wouldnt have happened otherwise, only giving more reinforcement to snarl. i do not mean to use this as a demeaning analogy or claim that everything is your fault. but that your perpetual unhappiness becomes an endless loop that may have originated totally out of your control in the beginning, perhaps in childhood, but becomes an unnecessary conditioned response maintaining your unhappiness when it no longer should.i am not making this high-effort post to claim myself holier than thou. i am merely questioning if there is any possibility to escape this state of mind if it no longer suits you. if the answer is yes, i believe the answer is out there somewhere for you. even if its not this post, i dont care. i hope it points to a general direction.if the answer is a unanimous no, downvote me, call me out in the comments, ban me from the sub. maybe i will understand that i was incredibly more naive that i presumed. though maybe it takes an outsider to point out your own flaws, maybe even harshly, if you refuse to see them for yourself and take responsibility.for me the answer was right in my face the entire time but i was too preoccupied in my head to even understand it. the answer for me was simply ""to be"" and because of this ""to be happy"".",2019-01-10

aeffqv,how do people do it...,depression,"  i dont understand how people just wake up and feel... i dunno... not like giving up? im beyond help, and am borderline to the point of finding the easiest way out, but im too fucking stubborn for that. like, every time my body wants to just collapse and not move, this little stubborn part of me just kicks it into overdrive, and carries me through the rest of my day. its exhausting... lets say a car has some kind of backup in it that kicks in when something breaks down, and it allows you to make it to where you need to go, but the cost is it uses up 5x the amount of gas. thats basically me, and ive been running on empty for years.    im a part-timer, with inconsistent hours, trying to pay for rent, trying to feed myself, trying to find things i can enjoy, dreaming and wishing id win enough money to relax, feeling dumber by the day, and getting so close to my breaking point... my friends keep asking me ""whats wrong,"" because apparently i ""seem off,"" but i must seem off every day. at this point, youd think theyd just be like ""oh, hes just a very sad, closed-off person!"" but no... something has to be wrong.    i never really had goals. if i did set something to reach for, i would just second guess myself, and feel stupid for it. i guess i have dreams though. unrealistic, borderline impossible, pointless dreams... but there are some normal ones. i wanted to be a cop, i wanted to be a firefighter, i wanted to be a chef, i mean... shit, at one point, i was like ""i could settle for a security job."" ... but i havent even tried. im afraid to try. ive been knocked down so much by others, that its hard to just stay up to keep myself alive.  i just want to be comfortable.  i just want to be happy.  i just want to feel okay.  i just want all of this to stop.  ""im selfish, because i only think of myself, and how i want to be better... so many others are in situations far worse than mine. im a terrible person for thinking i deserve better."" - that type of shit runs through my head every time i think about wanting to talk to someone.  im not okay. im not happy. im sorry. ive done nothing with my life, and will continue to do nothing...  i cant find someone to keep me company and help me out, because im not fit in the head to get into a relationship. i have a hard time just keeping friends anymore... yet i complain about being alone. fucking pathetic.    theres nothing i can do anymore, and people that try to help just get hurt. im a lost cause. i dont know why i try anymore.",2019-01-10 06:25:26,Ganondalf8,0

(i just remember this, but one time she scolded me for being happy and for laughing and said that that wasnt fair to her because she was alone)how can i leave it knowing that she is still suffering and probably will continue to suffer since shes religious and isnt educated about medication or the illness in general. i doubt that she even knows shes depressed. should i just try to find my own happiness and ignore her negativity? i literally came to my computer to write this after i went to the bathroom and had a tiny conversation with her. her eyes were red and watery, presumably from crying, and she told me to get closer. i guess she wanted to talk about something that is sad or is bothering her, but i have 0 fucking clue what is is, so i just said no and left. lmfao my life is a joke.

9j24v0,just not depressed anymore or hypomanic symptoms?,mentalhealth,"hello everybody,i apologize if this is somewhat of a “vanilla” question but i feel my mental health is at stake. i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder at the age of 18. i am now a 24 yo male. the periods usually range from 2-8 months of pure misery and suicidal ideation. i was hospitalized at an inpatient facility the july before last for these symptoms. just last week, i had what one may consider a suicide “attempt.” had the slipknot around my neck, note written, drunk enough for disinhibition, etc. was fading fast and around 5 secs away from passing out and asphyxiating myself. however, i felt an almost other-worldly presence crying out to me from in my body...almost like i was killing another pseudo-divine being inside me. like my body itself was crying out to spare it. so i did. this is where it gets tricky. my gp had started me on 5 mg of a newer ssri called trintellix about 3 days prior to this attempt. i was on no other medications up until that point (have been on others in the past, but weaned off 6 months prior). i am aware ssris can induce manic/hypomanic states and i fear this may be the case. from last week until now, it’s been almost a complete 180. i feel almost hyper-competent now. very motivated and have begun a strict diet and exercise regime. gotten more done in a week than the past 6 months. listening to music “speaks” to me again. i get chills up the spine and the back of my head from many songs, and just from thinking about profound thoughts about my life in general up until this point and how far i’ve come (i never get this neurochemical release when depressed). other changes in behavior: i’m much more open and talkative with people. i almost always feel like i can say the right thing. i am somewhat irritable and combative (really conscious to try to limit this). i can only sleep 5-6 hours a night, and it doesn’t feel very restful. still not tired during the day though. i have spent more money recently, but it’s on things to improve my health (new gym membership, new shoes for b-ball league, b-ball league fees, healthy food). i wasn’t really able to leave the house before up until this point. here’s the real kicker: i’ve displayed this behavior pattern before, back about 3 years ago in college. i believe it was also brought upon by the onset of a drug, this one an snri called bupuprion. much more irritable back then, to the point of outward physical aggression. i alienated a lot of good friends in this state with my behavior. some still won’t talk to me to this day. they used to say things like “you’ve changed.” but i ignored them until my parents kind of snapped me out of it. somewhat heavy amphetamine (adderall) use at this time. caffeine as well.fast-forward back to now, and i fear i may be in the same state. my stream of thoughts comes very fast, but not to the point of incomprehension or delusion. i’m really just afraid, guys. i have so many questions:has my medication induced a hypomanic state? has the trintellix even gotten enough time to take any sort of effect? is the sleep deprivation just my circadian rhythm readjusting to my sleep schedule (been trying to go to bed earlier). do any of these symptoms sound pathological in nature, or am i just being paranoid? is this just what it feels like to not feel depressed? i should add i am on no stimulants as i was afraid of going through that college thing again. and sorry for the long post: i’ve never relayed all of this information to someone at once before. i fear i may have been misdiagnosed; i’ve bounced around to so many mental health professionals that nobody has a comprehensive history of my behavior and mood patterns. tl;dr: have cyclical patterns that alternate between intense depression and more brief periods of “hyperactivity” and heightened states of well-being. not sure who i really am, or what my mental diagnosis should be. i’m really just trying to find the right medication for my condition (or lack thereof). i want to be a good person and not kill myself. i also fear another impending crash in mood from my current condition (depression always comes back for one reason or another). thank you for reading all or some of this post. i can clarify any info if need be.",2018-09-26 15:41:36,exactlyimprecise,1

abjsve,how do i get help,Anxiety,2018 became the year when anxiety and depression took over my life. i’m not officially diagnosed but i spend most days either sad or stressed or worried. i’ve had several panic attack-esque episodes and often feel a sense of impending doom. i feel miserable a majority of the time.i mostly have been telling myself it might be because it’s my first year with a career and the first year of me living in a city by myself. but it’s getting so overwhelming and my thoughts keep getting darker.i want help. i do. but i also really don’t want help. i hate the idea of seeing a counselor or therapist. i want to explore meds but am afraid of possible side affects or altering my brain state. i also keep telling myself that i had a healthy mind for years so i should be able to revert back. so really my question is: how do you go about asking for help or what options should i be pursuing? i feel lost and like there are no solutions. ,2019-01-01 19:12:30,MusicalMal,1
aed9e6,accepting needing medication again after years off of it. vent.,depression,"ive (23f) always hated that my body was incapable of keeping me balanced and happy. when i was 17, i was on zoloft for a few months and it help. the side effects were a lot to deal with though. sleep paralysis, appetite, etc. what helped is i picked up a few hobbies that i never had the motivation to keep up with otherwise. when i stopped taking it, over time, i kept up with them for years and stayed okay. id have episodes every now and then, but i was generally okay. this past year has been the best year of my life. i moved in with my soulmate. i have the happiest and healthiest relationship you could imagine. i laugh often, and he never fails to make me smile. but the last few months i had to quit my job because my boss was a homophobic, racist asshole and it made my anxiety, which had been next to none, escalate to insane levels of panic attacks to the point of throwing up. now, im struggling finding a new job. my best friend is moving 2000 miles away. my nightmares are back, my anxiety is worse than its ever been, and my depression has reach new levels.i refer to my depression episodes as being a passenger.. im not actually in my body as much as im just watching someone else live in my vessel. ive sat in our room, without moving or engaging in anything for hours at a time. i cant find the motivation to shower, or eat, or take part in any of my hobbies or interactions with my friends. im constantly breaking down into fits of profusely crying and feeling like i have someone sitting on my chest. ive spoken with my boyfriend and my parents. weve all agreed it would be best to go back on them and try prozac. and once i made the decision, which im fine with, my mind immediately sent me into a panic attack. ive been on edge, jumping at loud noises, not sleeping, and living as a passenger for two weeks now. im terrified. im absolutely terrified ill be trapped as a passenger, this half alive person, and now me. that it will numb me and keep me as a passenger, just not feeling anything. i dont know where else to post and dont want to worry anyone, im not suicidal, but god im so scared and dont want to live like this anymore. i have to accept that i do have manic depressive episodes and need this medication. but i wish i didnt need it to be human. i want to be human on my own. i want to be strong and conquer this on my own and no matter how hard i try, i cant. thanks for letting me vent, and thank you for caring if you made it this far. tldr: vent, i was doing so well off of my medicine for 5 1/2 years. now its worse than ever and i have to get back on them. and im not scared ill just be lifeless and numb.

ae8xth,no one can tell i'm depressed-and i keep it that way,depression,"this is my first post in the depression and im not sure why im posting. i guess i just need to get it off my chest. i think im depressed. i say i think cause ive never been diagnosed or sought treatment for depression in particular. im 22 now but ive been dealing with body image issues since i was 11 and the bulimia from sophomore year of high school. that was around the same time i started self harming. but no one could tell-i made sure to hurt myself in places covered by clothes and i still kept the same cheery demeanor i did everyday. i had good grades, a small but stable group of friends,  sports, played in the marching band. never went to a party. the ideal, boring high school student. my family had some issues, mainly between my brother and my dad, but i tried to stay out of it and be the dutiful daughter. doing chores, watching my siblings, listening to my parents. the self harming curbed as i was about to go to college but my eating disorder got worse. got to college and my first 2 years were pretty rough academically. skated by on natural talent in high school and realized that doesnt fly in university. ignored my grades and just tried to socialize as much as possible and started restricting my diet like crazy and working out for at least 2 hours a day just to feel in control. dropped to 105lb (im 54). was diagnosed with adhd my junior year much to the dismay of my parents-i was supposed to be the golden child. my brother was the trouble kid with the depression, anger issues, and adhd. just got medicated never went to therapy. junior year i was in a relationship. felt like i was soaring, continued to do mediocre in my classes and when i began to crash, i tried to turn to my then boyfriend for support but turns out he would rather go out to the bar and talk to other people. we broke up at the end of the year. depended on him so much i lost touch with a lot of friends and opportunities. during that time i didnt take my adhd meds regularly. just made me feel like shit that i had to take them in the first place. senior year my stress, depression, and anxiety was even worse. felt suicidal. was vomiting everyday and my grades were plummeting. felt like i was an idiot for picking a major as difficult as computer science when i wasnt applying myself like i should. tried a couple therapy sessions at the end of the year and tried to talk to my mom about sitting in on a session over the phone and she screamed at me about how i was faking/overreacting. dropped to 94lb around this time. i was also about to take my 5th year cause i had planned my classes so horribly and also wanted to improve my gpa. i think i wouldve really hurt myself seriously if my current boyfriend wasnt there to just keep me company and be positive. still, i never told him fully what was going on. now hes in california and im on the east coast and were doing a long distance thing and hes still amazing. so loving and kind and ive let him know to a small extent my feelings of depression and i made it seem like i used to have an eating disorder though i still have episodes to this day. but things at home are getting worse and my mom and dad are fighting, my brother (20, has pretty mentally abusive tendencies stemming from anger and depression) is making things harder on my mom and i can see her starting to crack. my little sister (11) cries in secret after their fights and im the one who tries to comfort her when shes trying to get away. im at home now for winter break and im so stressed about home life once i leave and my mom has no one to help her cook, clean, or listen to her. also been stressed this past month because last semester, right before finals i fainted twice in 3 days and got concussed. felt silly the first time i fainted (during an exam) and tried to brush it off and just made a couple appointments to check myself out the next week. fainted 2 days later, hit my head harder. concussed. still have headaches and my mood has been even lower but i still have to study. yet, im still trying to be supportive and happy for my mom. trying to help around the house while studying for the exams i couldnt take. trying to build a better relationship with my brother and help him even when he hurls abuse at me, not that thats always. trying and trying but not feeling like im making any progress. feel like im a failure. ive always ""joked"" for the last few years i wasnt gonna make it past 30 cause of stress and the fact i get sick all the time. been saying that a little more often and my boyfriends picking up on it and hes starting to get concerned but now im doing my best to cover it up. last night, he called me and i joked i wanted to die. but for a bit i didnt know if i was joking. i wasnt even sad anymore. just reached a point where i didnt feel anything and just thought of how i could kill myself-obviously didnt act on it. just told my boyfriend i didnt much want to talk about what was going on and went to sleep. i dont know if this is dissociation but i can imagine myself being gone without feeling much right now. and at the moment that doesnt even scare me. just wanted to get that off my chest. &#x200b;tldr; i look happy, successful, healthy, and smart but im dealing with an eating disorder, family issues, post concussion syndrome, academic struggles, and what i think is depression. been covering it up very well my whole life. starting to imagine taking my own life. doesnt even make me sad anymore-dont know if im starting to dissociate because ive never felt this way before. dont know why im sharing except to see if others have had the same experience.

aebt2e,i can finally meditate without getting discouraged,depression,"meditating used to stress me out because i have problems with focus and attention. id do the guided meditations which helped but i found myself getting frustrated with my constant thoughts. i felt like i was doing it wrong.i learned that this is actually very normal and nothing to feel bad about. you just try to gently return yourself to focusing on your breath. now i can do meditation to just relaxing sounds (like the ocean or whatever else) and actually sit with my thoughts while also feeling very clear and stable. its so empowering.anyways, yeah. im really excited because now meditation is helping me sort my thoughts and feel less anxiety and depression especially the physical symptoms. i wanted to share this since it could maybe help other people who struggle.",2019-01-09 23:49:24,fransacco_,1

aebs9z,my classmate killed himself yesterday.,depression,"a classmate killed himself yesterday. i didnt know him very much and we didnt really talk that much, but it really hit me. i had absolutely no idea and no one i know really knows the reason... he didnt show any signs of anything, he had friends. but i guess thats how it often is. im really sad now, that i couldnt get to know him better or maybe even couldve helped him in some way. it just came out of no where. this is just to tell people to always speak up to someone. suicide is never the only option. please talk to people about your problems. even if you think no one cares about you, trust me, theres always someone, that really does. people care that we might not even be aware of. if you feel that youre alone and a burden and things will never get better--thats not true. thats the depression lying to you and warping your thoughts. there always is another way.",2019-01-09 23:47:14,CreeLogic,1
aebrvs,"does anyone else hate those stupid self help posts about ""getting out and living your life to the fullest""?",depression,"its not that i dont want to do more with my life. i would love to be anywhere other than here, out doing things i enjoy, making friends, traveling the world, and working at a job that doesnt make me hate my life like all those stupid self help websites say is the key to curing depression. but thats not how the world works. the set of circumstances i wound up in have basically made this far too difficult.i can rarely afford to do anything because my job pays me in literal pocket change (i get payed only in tips), and my attempts to get a better paying job (much less a job i enjoy) in this shithole of a city has been fruitless. id go to collage and get a higher education, but even that is insanely difficult, because my gpa is terrible, i cant afford it even with scholarships (and im not using loans, id be in debt till i died), and the mere thought of having to go back to school again, given how horrid my grade school experience was, give me no amount of revulsion. but i need to go to some type of higher learning school, as its the only way to get a skill set needed to get an even remotely well paying job, and make actual friends my age. i dont want to, and i dont even know how i could, but its my only way out, and even then it seems too far out of reach.and i cant drive, and learning how is proving difficult because of my anxiety and lack of multitasking skills. i can get in a car and drive it from point a to b on an empty stretch of road no problem, but the moment i get on a highway or city road it becomes far too stressful. having to deal with other drivers, the speed limit, the various road rules, and my impatient asshole of a dad in the passengers seat yelling orders at me is insanely nerve wracking. id ask somebody else to take me places, but my family members hate going anywhere they need to be unless its important, so i only get to go out if somebody else is, and i cant use uber or some kind of public transit, but we live a ways outside town so uber doesnt pick up here and the lawmakers where i live (southern usa) seem to view public transportation as this strange foreign concept they cant properly comprehend. not like i could afford it with my income anyway.im trapped on this metaphorical island with now way off because i cant sail a boat through rough seas.it wouldnt even be so bad if the internet here wasnt fucking horrible. i used to play games online a lot and i had a bunch of online friends, now i can barely use a web browser. it gets worse and worse by the month no matter what we do, and no matter how many times the isp sends a repair guy out. and they absolutely refuse to upgrade us to a faster service despite our neighbors having (slightly) better internet packages. i even made an fcc complaint to try and solve the issues, but not only did our isp not fix anything, i think they intentionally made it worse out of spite.that is why im depressed, its not that i dont want to be out doing things or enjoying my life, ""living life to the fullest"", i just cant. im either stuck here doing fuck all or doing yard work because my dad cant be bothered to do it himself, or im stuck at my shitty job that i cant quit yet because my parents wont let me unless i have another lined up.if it wasnt for my crippling existential fear of death, i probably wouldve offed myself already, and even that is starting to lose effectiveness. i dont want to die, nor do i wish i was never born, i just wish my life was better, that things just went my way for a change, and i could actually enjoy myself for once. id go seek mental help, but ive lost my health due to turning 21 (military dependant) and now i cant afford insurance or any medical care for that matter. ive been trying to find a better job so i can move out and get healthcare, but the only jobs that have been willing to hire are basically minimum wage slave labor with no benefits. ive even been trying to use my disability, aspergers syndrome, to help find jobs and benefits, but even that has proved fruitless. most job sites about aspergers/autism just inform companies on resources for hiring people with asd, but dont actually provide a resource for asd people. the only site i found that was a job resource for people with asd had zero jobs in my area.at this point, i just want to give up. my life feels like ive endured tons of shit for very little in return. i feel trapped, but im too cowardly for even the cowards way out",2019-01-09 23:46:09,Sir_Maxwell_378,1
aebrff,am i really depressed?,depression,"ive been confused about this for the past few months. i always trust therapists (only recently, before i hated them and i still kinda do) but i think they got me wrong. i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and ive been taking a 50mg ssri for it. but reading some stories about depression here and elsewhere makes me wonder if i even have depression.i rarely ever burst out in tears or anything like that, i just see no point in anything. i have no real interest in anything, and my 2 friends only talk to me in school and i might hang out with them 4 times a year. the only thing i really like is music, but i usually get made fun of for it. however, i actually do feel a difference with my medication, and i really do think its starting to help, and my therapist is about to bump it up to 75 mg. but i still dont feel like doing anything, i just do things like post this because *i dont give a sh\*t about anything.* also, i have pretty extreme social anxiety, and i hate talking to or even being seen by people. whats wrong with me?",2019-01-09 23:44:52,ursiamesetwin,1

a95uls,work problems,Anxiety,"so i decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and get a part time job to force myself to meet new people. i wasn’t working a lot of hours, but it was something. then my anxiety and depression got really bad (it normally does around this time of year because of sad anniversaries). i started taking my anxiety meds again and i literally slept through the first hour of one of my shifts. i was too embarrassed to tell my boss exactly what happened so i made a stupid excuse. and then she literally told me that none of my coworkers or managers like me and i need to get my shit together. i’ve been open with her in the past about my mental illness but telling someone with anxiety and bipolar paranoia that no one likes them seems..... wrong. i guess i can’t expect other people to fully understand my condition, but i wouldn’t say that to someone whether they had a condition or not. i ended up quitting on the spot because i felt extremely uncomfortable. am i being overly sensitive? i mean of course i am but is she to some extent in the wrong here?

7pjths,being in public actually helps my anxiety,Anxiety,i know for most people being out in public only worsens anxiety. however its helped me stay calm during attacks and keep grounded. i also get anxious by myself so that could be a factor. i think the best thing is it forces me to not freak out and hyperventilate because i always try to blend in in public. so now when i have an attack i go sit in a public space that still gives me space to collect myself and thoughts. does anyone else find public spaces help anxiety?,2018-01-11 01:38:35,rainbowdash64,0

[rant],depression,"so in less than 2 months i am graduating high school. my mom is not letting me accept my offer to the only university that has accepted me. it is a journalism and digital media major which i realize will not do much for me. my mom is waiting for another school to accept me (the deadline to accept is in 2 weeks which my mom doesnt realize is stressing me out) so i cant accept it and im not even sure i want it anymore. i am at a 76.9% average in school but its slipping since i keep avoiding school. after 4 years i dont want to be here. and university just seems to me like high school farther away from home, where i have to start over and make new friends which i have never done on my own. i feel like a helpless child who cant control anything in her life. my urges to self harm have come back tenfold, they were ok for a while but lately all i want is to hurt myself. my friend wants to stage an intervention for me because i threw up and missed 2 days of school after a night of drinking and drug use. i feel like sometimes im subconsciously trying to kill myself. she has no issue with me smoking since she does it too, but when i run out, i switch to dxm and alcohol which she doesnt approve of. i know its bad but right now, its the only thing that makes me happy.my dad is not in the house for the next month because of work so im left alone with my mom and sister who both hate me. and soon i will be completely alone. is there even a point in trying to better myself when i know i will crumble down again. i have tried to help myself but i have zero self control and i have nobody who i can honestly talk to about how i feel. so i guess im already pretty alone.i have so much more i could rant about but im not good at explaining things. plus i just dont think its worth it. i just need some reassurance or a hug or something because life is pretty shit right now, sorry.",2017-05-08 16:09:42,rainbowdash64,1

6udksd,i wish i didn't care.,depression,"i thought stopping the crying daily was a sign of improvement. but i guess its not. the emotions are worse. i wish i could cry. its a way to release emotion, and a healthy one at that. now the only way i do is by lashing out at people around me, and not in a good way. its only a matter of time until it starts bleeding from my family life into my social life, though i hope that never happens. just yesterday, i lashed out at my brother because he was beating me at mario kart. at a fucking game that im supposed to find fun, not a thing thats supposed to make me kick someone. jokes arent a good outlet either because before i started actually telling friends ""hey im depressed"" i wasnt being taken seriously, and now it feels like im only getting uncomfortable laughs because nobody knows how to respond. i dont know why im not getting a therapist. i really should be, but im not. i guess my experience with my last one when he tried to help with my depression is whats stopping me from getting one. i know i need the help. i know that one will help at least a little. but i feel like id be wasting my parents money on something that wont be important when im gone. plus, if i do ever end up moving out of my parents home, having a therapist would be too expensive for a college kid/fresh out of college kid, if i even get into college. i feel like a failure and like i cant do anything right. i cant comfort friends right. i cant do anything in music right, barring maybe a bit of sound design and composition, and idk why i even try. ill never get to a professional level. i cant cook right, i cant clean right, i cant manage my money right, i cant sleep right, i cant even fucking cry right! im a fucking shitty person and dont deserve to have friends, but yet they stay for some reason. i have no redeeming qualities. all i do is bring everyone around me down. im fucking toxic. im a manipulative, lying, narcissistic, fucking retarded bitch who cant do anything for himself. im almost worse than trump. the only thing going for me over him is i dont endorse nazis and fascists, and now ill stop talking about politics because that never ends well. fuck my life. nothing good has ever come out of it. i got scratched by my brother the other day, i think friday, and had to hide the mark because he drew blood and it would look like i started cutting, and i dont need people worried about me. those lyrics that i wrote for my songs (both unreleased) have been my thoughts, brought down from the ""i want to dies"" to stuff thats more acceptable. look at linkin park if you need a reference, chesters lyrics are literally a 10-year-long suicide note if you look at it. speaking of that, im fucking insensitive. i dont react when someone like a celeb dies, i didnt react when my first dog died, my first cat died, and i doubt id react if any of my grandparents died. i wish i could just not care. i wish i could just not feel. life would be so much easier, so much less painful. i wouldnt want to die. i wouldnt care. id function more normally. i wouldnt have a hopeless crush on someone that i cant get with. id be free from all this pain. id stop hurting the people around me. i wouldnt have emotions to store past the point of breaking.ill shut up now. this is getting way too long.",2017-08-18 01:27:44,GaminGamer01,1

ae6yep,missed my first therapy appointment,depression,"hi guys! i have been following this this sub alot and before going into what i have been going through i wanted to tell everyone how special and unique they are. and you are so worth it. a while back i was diagnosed with severe depression and disordered eating ( anorexia kind of ). in october i admitted myself to an emergency room in my city because i didn’t want to live anymore. i was feeling like everything i did was worthless, that i was not good looking, overweight even though i am a 21 year old girl, 5’5 106 pounds. i had no job or education and felt like a total failure. i still feel like this at this day but, still need help. i am seeing a therapist who is great, since that time in october and have been making steps to finish my classes and get a job. but i wanted to do behavioural cognitive therapy first, my therapist referred me. my first meeting was this morning. and i flaked. so hard. i couldn’t sleep, i have this huge migraine because i kept clenching my jaw, and there is a huge snow storm outside. it seems like a good enough reason to not go right. but i still feel like i am making up excuses to not go or do anything. i used to think that i had to go out at least once a day, even if its just going to the grocery store. it was important to go out. even just a little. i havent got out of my house in a while except a couple of days ago for a meeting i had with my guidance counsellor. i have to go out and buy my medication but cant even find that motivation. is it too cold? do i hate winter? am i tired? or am i depressed and just lazy. feels like the last one constantly. it feels like i only find excuses. one part of me says it is okay and the other one shames me for being at home all day. even though i do chores for 4-6 hours a day, try and workout a little in my living room, put makeup on, i even paint even though i am so bad lol . i try to do things that i like. but it always feels like it is not enough and im lazy and i feel that everyone thinks that i am even my boyfriend. i don’t know if i want to go to this therapy center i was talking about earlier, got off track a bit. it is very far away, like 1 hour to go by bus and i do not have a car. i try my best for real and i am just getting sadder and even more scared because i am scared i will never accomplish anything, and i will be like this forever. i desperately want to get better. i would do anything but at the same time i feel like nothing is going to solve this. sorry for this huge rant people. i hope you have a wonderful day.

a2140r,"reading my journals from 2013-2015 as well as my journal over this past year was emotional. chronicling my journey through depression, drug addictions, life lessons and on to a healthy life i never thought i’d ever see.",offmychest,"i’ve struggled with drugs my whole life. i’m 27 now and started my first journal when i was 21. i started it to help get my troubles out on paper after my first real breakup and deal with my depression. from where i am now, not very far, but 95 days clean, that first entry in 2013 was very sad. i talked about how painkillers were the only things keeping me alive (so i thought) and how much i “needed” them. those entries detailed such an uncomfortable part of my life all the way up to that christmas when i was cut off from my “doctor” and ran out of my saved $8,000 i’d spent in one month. i had to detox and that was extremely painful and difficult. but i did it. the saddest part of that journal was the few weeks in between getting clean from oxycontin and my move to molly and quickly into cocaine. it was awful reading how i was trying to be cautious about taking these new drugs while i partied every weekend. how i knew it was a slippery slope back to addiction, and how it inevitably became a bad problem. it followed my many moves through california, friends made and lost, parties that came and went. it continued on to the meeting of who would become my wife and how terribly that relationship began. bouncing back and forth from breakup to makeup, reading how the codependency rapidly manifested, and our rampant drug use began and ended. it chronicles my loss of friends due to their unacceptability of my relationship due to it beginning with her cheating on someone and moving right on to me and the turmoil that followed. they eventually accepted her and we became a group and our partying became full force as we got stronger hookups with better coke. i wrote that journal up to a point where nothing was good in our relationship. married, living together, money problems, my mistrust of her and her understandably inability to handle my ups and downs, manic highs from being bi-polar and a drug addiction stronger than she knew was possible. she eventually noticed she had a problem and stopped, but i couldn’t and just went on behind her back. that lasted 3 years. then on to this years journal. such a stark contrast. i went through the worst drug addiction i’d ever put myself through and i moved away from home. i wish i could say i didn’t relapse a few times, but i did. i got my mind right, but i just couldn’t let that party go. i overdosed one night after i’d met a girl i really liked. i knew after that night that if i wanted to be anything to this girl, i’d need to stop it all. nothing ever came of that attraction, but i haven’t touched a drug since that night. it’s been 95 days. i now live a very healthy life, away from all my friends, family and the toxic situations of my past. i’m very happily divorced having not seen my ex in almost a year. i’ve moved out of state to a place i’d never thought i’d end up and i’m so relaxed and relieved. i exercise every single day, i journal and i meditate. i work daily to understand my nature and rebuild the parts of me that serve no positive purpose. i believe becoming who i am today couldn’t have happened any other way. i’ll forever feel remorse for all the people i hurt along the way.i’ve learned so many valuable lessons by living a rollercoaster of a life that was fun for a little while. but all rollercoasters come to an end. it is, and always was, my choice to either move on to the next ride or forever call it a day. the glow sticks have lost their glow and the sun has come up. this life cost me my old one and i’m happy to tie it off. tldr: journals chronicle my journey through drug addictions, life lessons and on to a healthy life i never thought i’d ever see.

9wn3l3,the consequences of your past will always effect your future no matter how turned around you become. good or bad.,offmychest,"it doesn’t matter how cleaned up you get or how well you’re doing, when you’ve burnt most of the bridges you’ve ever built, intentionally or not, it can get lonely and sometimes you can never go back.  someone once told me “if you’re lonely when you’re alone you’re in bad company.” there’s been no quote i’ve held closer to my heart than that one. i’ve hurt a lot of people on many different levels. i had no idea who i was a year ago. i’ve spent the last year, i hate this term, soul searching. and i’m happy to say i found it. i know who i am. i know what i’ve done. i’ve done all i can to show everyone who ever doubted me and more importantly myself that i’m not a piece of shit and i am a good person, regardless of my behaviors and actions in the past. the best part is that progression should be continuous and i never want to stop. i haven’t spoken to my dad in 5 months. i intentionally cut him out of my life for so many reasons i could fill a book. my life would be very different had he passed instead of my mom. i don’t blame him for any mistake i’ve made, but i have solid reasons to leave him behind. unfortunately, my siblings and nephews have turned against me. i can’t say i blame them seeing as they all live off my dad, but hey, there always must be a family villain. truthfully, i have a few people in my life that have faith in me and love me. if it weren’t for them, i have no idea how much further i could have dug the grave i crawled out of without dying. they helped me get through my divorce and drug addiction. the divorce finalized on the 2nd and i’m almost 90 days clean from addictions i never ever thought i would give myself. for them i am eternally grateful. rigorous exercise and my militant routine combat depression better than any drug or codependency ever could. that’s the best advice i could give any kid suffering from mental illness. the biggest part of me wants to tell someone that they were right. to tell them thank you and how sorry i am that they had to suffer for me to get to where i am. if i could have done it differently, i would have. i know the damage, the scarring and the nightmares i’ve caused. there’s nothing i can do to make it better and i’ll always think about it. they were right. i wore out my welcome back home so i left. you can call it running away or starting over. maybe it’s both. the fact is, i’m happy. i’m ok because i get to hang out with myself every day. i actually love myself. i hated people telling me i needed to do that. i never knew how. it just happened one day. it just clicked on after non stop self improvement. i can recall the exact moment. i’m forming new, healthy relationships, because i know how to now, and life is what i’d always wanted it to be. i just needed to be in control and i never was. things don’t suck anymore, i just needed to get these feelings off my chest. hopefully this was the place to do it. thanks.

ae551a,"i’m depressed. i know i will live through so many happy moments, but i still can’t escape suicidal thoughts",depression,"hello. just to start this off, i’m not currently in any danger, and when i say i feel suicidal, it’s more of a general feeling opposed to a crisis situation, if that makes sense. anyhow. as i’ve gotten older, i’ve realized how truly toxic my mother is. she is a victim of abuse, and has had many difficulties in her life that make being a kind, centered person difficult. but it’s like she doesn’t make the actual effort, she has a ficade of therapy effort - making endless lists about how to appreciate things more and how to be kinder - but never actually following through or trying to stay centered. i am depressed myself, and i understand how difficult it can be, but sometimes it feels like she’s given up any effort and it negatively effects those closest to her (me, her husband).to put it very mildly and in fewer words, my childhood wasn’t great. i’ve grown to be a little closed off, but it seems like more so now for some reason i feel very disconnected from other people, the concept of family, familial love. commercials with families make me roll my eyes and cringe, people with children make me feel gross, children in general make new little uncomfortable, when people talk about culture or heritage it makes me want to about puke. i don’t know if i’m more realistic, or a product of how i was raised, but i feel alone in the world. i know i can make friends, and i can make family from friends, and i can love myself and my hobbies, but... knowing that i don’t have a normal family to support me is making me sad. but it feels like i don’t even want to feel that way because i think family is stupid and bad. knowing i will never be able to have a normal wedding, knowing that i will feel guilt for not working harder to bond with my mom, feeling like every family gathering or party is torture (my own small family or otherwise), feeling almost like an orphan. i feel like i want to be able to have a family to love me and who i can go “look at what i did” or “i need motherly support”. i can’t imagine this with my real parents, but just quasi fake parents that aren’t the ones i have. all of that family build up leading to, i truly feel alone in the world. that gut feeling, where your just i your room and you’re half aware and there’s pressure ringing in your ears. i don’t see the point of living life sometimes, if i am to have such a lonely existence with no one i can fall back on, or trust, or talk to, or just feel comfortable around or feel happy to see. this general lonely feeling and a bit of a drift in my direction in my life after i was thrown of course have culminated in me thinking about offing myself or just stepping on the train tracks. i won’t, because i’m truly a coward, and thinking about suicide is a lot easier than doing it, like, ow man. i would feel guilty for the train operator and whoever sold me the gun, i wouldn’t want them to feel bad. anyhow. i am mindful, and aware of my depression, and how to deal with it well and properly, i’m managing myself, but even still... it feels bad, man. i just don’t have anyone i feel like are my people that i can be myself around just cuz we’re related. honestly, that almost sounds foreign to me and i get weirded out by families that are close. but i can’t tell if i’m the weird one? or out of touch, perhaps. i don’t know what to do with this feeling - drawing, reading, distraction helps, but it creeps back and weighs me down. i can’t mindful myself out of it. all of that, combined with global warming, politics, corruption... i feel as if there is a lot of practical weight both personal and worldly that are getting me down beyond a point that i can truly remedy, because some stuff is just extra sucky. i know it can’t always be sucky... but when it sucks, it **sucks**. but after all that, i realized, writing that down helped a little. i’m still stuck here, floating in gelatin, but at least i can do things to feel 2% better. thanks for coming to my gad talk.

7w2h5s,i didn’t expect to live this long and now i don’t know how to live,depression,"hi, this is my first post so i don’t know if i’m doing it right. i’m 19-years-old and graduating from high school to college this year. i’ve always had to take care of my family because they were dependent on and my parents have been working and had obstacles in their jobs several times in my childhood. i was left alone with my younger sister (only a year younger) and had to practically raise her. i was always living and trying for my family. looking back, i grew depressed when i was 13. back then i expected to live till 18 then kill myself or run away or leave everything somehow. i didn’t plan to not fuck up to live till 21. and now i’m 19 and preparing for college and i still hate my life and i hate myself and everything and everyone because even though i’m alive, it just hurts everyday. i don’t know what to do. it hurts to pretend i want to live. i don’t want to. i hate every bit of my life and if it were up to me i would’ve killed myself long ago. i lived for my family but now i regret it. i don’t know what other ways i can find a reason to live, i feel like i’m going through the rest of my life this way; angry, tired, and unhappy. my sister, because she was younger was spoiled. my mom, dad, and i all endured hardships so we didn’t want her do and tried to make sure she got everything she wanted in life. but somehow she still end up having anxieties about school and worries herself to tears. she’s a hardworker but even at 18 she’s behind on standards and has to be helped on essays for punctuation and capitalization. i get frustrated with her because she’s a brat and even knowing that i struggle, she won’t make my life easier. it hurts me to see her cry so i always end up helping her but now she doesn’t know how to live. i guess the dependency is one reason i’m living. i hate my life so much but i don’t want her to feel that way so i try to support her. i don’t have anyone to depend on so i automatically try to allow others to depend on me, but i just end up doing things for others. i don’t have a reason to live for myself. it hurts a lot everyday.",2018-02-08 06:59:53,joonie10132017,1

ae3vo0,my wits' end rant.,depression,"first off, i should say that this will probably seem like random thoughts strung together with barely any kind of cohesiveness.okay, i am a 36 year old guy that has been dealing, or suffering from, depression and anxiety for about a decade now. during this whole time i have been living with my mother. since moving in, one of my brothers has moved in as well. im not going to go into very many details about him other than he is older than me and has three kids he gets visitation with every other week. meaning the kids stay here as well. oh, and i will add that i absolutely despise him.anyway, weve been living like this, the three of us plus occasionally three children, for 8 years.in the beginning of all of this, when i first moved in with my mother, i was down or sad, but i didnt let it get to me as much. since we moved and my brother moved in as well, i have been getting down a lot more often, or have anxiety attacks at random it seems. some of it i know is my mind giving me reasons for such things to happen, but the rest i believe is because of the family i live with. i often joke about how this place is a black hole that sucks away any joy i may obtain. but its really not that far from the truth. every time i do actually feel good, or like everything will be alright, its usually because im somewhere else for an extended period of time. then, like always, i come back home and all of that joy is sucked down into the joyless black hole. of course, the reasonable thing to do is for me to move out. but i have not worked in three years due to my issues. before that id barely work. some jobs here and there, but id usually quit due to the same issues that keep me from trying to work at all. if i do get a job id need to save like crazy, but i already know the leaches that i love with will constantly bug me for money. not that im saying i shouldnt help out around the house at all, but they would drain me of every penny. not to mention my bad spending habits. so, basically what i am saying is that i need to get out of this house. i do not have anywhere else to go, dont have a job, and i cant ever seem to get myself to even try to get one. if i cant do any of this, i dont know how much more i can allow myself to take. any advice would be greatly appreciated. and i do mean more than the standard get a job and get out stuff i hear from everyone already.

(i am still able to make myself game with them some. i stopped for a long time but i realized i needed to at least reconnect with them since it would be good for me and had no negatives plus i missed them.)this is truly like being in some unending nightmare, realizing where you are, and then not being able to remember when you got here, or fathom how you will leave it. as one of the few people who believe that literally no one deserves to suffer, i will also say that regardless who you are(literally) you person reading this dont deserve to suffer so much and if you havent realized that i hope you do. and i hope things improve some for you if they are bad. id make a throwaway but i am the not-really-functioning-at-all-depression type so i have lost everything i am capabale of losing basically anyway.*hr claims they believed that i wanted to quit, and what i said could reasonably probably be seen that way so its not like i can win a law suit or risk filing.

85zuxj,my depression story,depression,"i used to take depression as a joke when i was a little ignorant kid, but over the past 2 years i’ve experienced the real degrading symptoms that one can experience being depressed. its gotten worse and worse, but now i think i’m starting to improve. here are some reasons why my mental state has degraded. 1. so sophomore year i started dating this beautiful, kind, and caring girl that just wanted to be my best friend and love me and do stuff with me. one night for some cruel, arrogant, selfish reason my plastered-drunk self decided that losing my virginity was more important than her. but it wasn’t only the heinous act of cheating on her is what made me hate myself. she found out and then forgave me. this amazing girl that showed me unconditional love just forgave me and still wanted to be with me. i was elated and we decided that we were both just going to put this situation behind us, but the stain was permanent. we kept dating for two more months and were kind of happy but it didn’t last. she was not happy and she would cry regularly and so would i. i tried my best to fix our relationship and make her happy again, but she said that she could never really get over what i did to her and who can blame her? i was the complete source of her unhappiness so i set her free and told her to leave me. we were still friends and regularly talked and i could see her start to blossom again like she was when we first met, but i can still never get over the guilt of cheating on her, then giving her the burden of forgiving me and staying with me in an unhappy relationship. i feel like i have this stain of manipulation in my character that to me just destroys my self worth. i feel like i just completely let her down because kind and loving people like her don’t deserve that ever and i feel as though i will never truly be able to show her how deeply sorry i am and how much i still care about her. like its already too late. im not asking to be forgiven nor do i want to be, i just want to move on from it, but i can’t seem to shake this sticking guilt.2. i’ve always felt like i’m a hindrance on people that work with and interact with. i’m a slow learner and always have been, but it seems that whenever i work with people theres this vibe of frustration with me and it makes me feel like i’m stupid and can’t do anything right. i feel that every time at work and at school 3. i love my brother with all my heart and i’m pretty sure we are each others’ best friend, but i feel a sort of resentment towards him and feel guilty about it. my brother is a few years older than me so naturally he was stronger than i was. he bullied me a lot growing up. he would constantly call me really hurtful things on an almost daily basis and would punch me on a daily basis too. i could never walk past him in the house without being hurt or berated by him in some way. it seemed like i always had a bruise from him to always remind me that he didn’t see me as his brother, but as as more weight on his shoulders. i know some may read this and think “well thats just what older brothers do,” but growing up i all i wanted from him was to be his friend and do stuff brother stuff with him, but he would constantly knock me down and push me away. we are best friends now that he is grown up and is in college, but i sometimes have a hard time believing he is genuinely sorry for how he treated me growing up. and i feel guilty because maybe he feels i was too clingy towards him and maybe i deserved it. in 2016 through early 2017 i felt mainly sad and drained and stupid, but late 2017 to today i’ve started having suicidal thoughts. i thought about how and where i would kill myself, what my suicide note would say and how or if my friends and family would grieve for me. i don’t think i have a real desire to commit suicide, but sometimes i think that maybe dying will defeat my demons.  i don’t want to believe this and i have been improving and getting less and less of these thoughts through the week, but it can be really hard to keep those thoughts out of my head sometimes. i truly believe that talking about this and getting these problems off my chest does make me feel better and thats why i’m writing this. if you have any advice on how to cope with this or if you have a story you would like to share with me i will greatly appreciate it. if you sense that maybe someone is going through depression please reach out to them and make yourself someone that can be there for them. even if they are just having a temporary low point, it can really mean the world knowing that someone out there cares about them and wants to seen them thrive.thank you for hearing me.",2018-03-21 07:58:30,NIAD_SIRDNE,1

adz652,instagram’s new feature makes me more depressed...,depression,"so apparently not being content with being “facebook for kids”, instagram is continuing its desire to become “facebook for kids (with features from snapchat). basically there’s this new feature called “close friends”, where your able to make these stories that only people you approve of can see when they’re a part of this snapchat-esque friend rating. i think that this is being implemented to stop people from creating “finstas”. accounts that people use for like a year or two and then create another one are probably annoying and take up lots of server space. so instead of creating a more personal account, you can post what i think are temporary and only the people you want to know will see these pictures. however, i think this is a pretty shortsighted solution, and it’s only going to make actual problems on instagram worse.it seems ironic to me that the website that’s been proven via survey to be the worst social media service for teens and young adults is basically adding a social hierarchy system to their app. what good is this feature going to do? all that’s going to happen is people will feel worthless or depressed when they say that they’re not somebody’s “close friend”. instead of having a reason to make a second account for your friends or whatever, instagram just wants to give you the ability to tell people to screw off. and it runs both ways too.people who utilize this feature are going to become stressed because they already have followers and stuff, and now they have to manage a close friends list to make sure people aren’t excluded or drop people from it that they want to blow off, just creating a more passive aggressive statement. so great job making people feel even more stressed. not to mention how instagram is also commonly linked to body shaming and other forms of bullying. that’s not going to get any better with a list of people you can exclude them from. stop trying to pepper in bits of stressful snapchat.#fuckinstagram",2019-01-08 23:28:36,Jack-sama15,1

""well, if its early enough, im paying the mob. if not, im buying some legs."" i try being an activist for my cause with things like a documentary--no updates in a year from the filmmakers. my friend has her reality show in the top 25 shows on cable, in its 3rd season. i have to compare myself to others, as doing so is not an option, as it fuels my thirst for knowledge.my dreams of finding a nice guy, even if it doesnt work out, well thats fading. high school folks, even if doesnt work, are getting engaged. dont want that yet, but want to at least be on the market, which good luck with how low my voice sounds and the fact i cant conceive. never could carry because of medical stuff. so ill grow old and die alone. friends will have moved on. ill be in a group home. goals unmet, be it just on a game show, living alone or just anything normal someone my age would do.i cant even have a job i dislike for 20 hours/week to work towards a hobby/dream job i want--making youtube videos at the arcade, just to help people win things, cheer up their day a little, give back to the world at large. been like this too long to see anyone else suffer, so i figured ages ago, if i cant help myself, why not help others? as my facebook cover photo says, weve given two hands: one to help ourselves, the other to help others. seems that former hand was cut off in my case, to be honest.the best part of my day is just talking or writing about sports, which is fun for me, i admit, but thats all ive got, and even then, that has its come and go phases for me. i just feel cursed by my own doing, which has made me a terrible person to everyone. just going on hoping some semblance of these dreams deferred, whithering like raisins in the sun, can bear some form of fruity, plump grapes.i want to succeed so much, much as i doubt myself. but because of personal matters, seems it wont happen. rarely do i blame the world around me, as this is of my own doing, volition. so many great ideas will pass. this life will have been for nothing once i go. nobody will have known or cared, although likely better without me. and, to be sure, at this point, why should they, much as id like to do otherwise? everything i do is midasian, except it turns to shit. try my best, but its not good enough. just dont know what i can do. got things planned out, but as usual, delayed beyond belief. couldnt i just have at least a normal life? i question my purpose daily, even beyond that of the philosophical. got one of the few good things left taken away, between that and my father...miss these things dearly.thanks for reading, and bless you kind soul for doing so. wish you an excellent time of your life, and may your days be joyous as the harmonies of joyous chorales.",2017-07-20 01:01:22,The_Running_Sloth,1

and thats where matters get complicated.i started hormones at age 20, which a lot of people say is young. not me! ive always known since i was two, and was denied hormones by rather uninformed doctors and therapist four years, most of my teen years, so i am still very bitter about never getting to experience high school as my true self. however, this was no fault of my family; they are extremely supportive of my transition and so forth, very much so, but im told that i look in-between by some of them, after like 2.5 years on hormones, which hurts a bit, though perhaps understandable due to cognitive biases. my hair doesnt grow out either, though it has been a touch recently. pretty much all people over five see me as female, but i think theyre just being nice, but its hard to tell at times. that, and four year old kids dont think im a girl, they think im just playing tricks on them, which is crushing. probably this voice, though they also say i dont look like one, which is the last thing i need. horrific, really...ive been told my voice sounds like jessica rabbit, but im not dumb enough to believe such nonsense. i also worry about my ability to get employed; i look at the fact that i applied for a few fast food places in the area, and they still wouldnt hire me, after an interview in which i discussed the entire company history, plus their menu, as to be best educated about the practices of the applicable corporation. if i cant get hired for this, no reason to think i can succeed in my desired major, finance, either. after all, my grades sunk the past three semesters after my father died completely unexpectedly, who i was really close withand thus, i live at home, with no friends in this state i can talk to. im told im a mooch, a leech, and that i need to get a life. this doesnt help things at all, and not really sure what i can do there. i want to be able to repay my family for all theyve done for me, and then some. so, the way i figured i would do that is get on wheel of fortune, since they were in my area, and its my webpages focus. disclosure: i love my game shows, pathetic a hobby as it is. a lot. i do really well at them, so it seems like it would be beneficial to get on. so, its january 2014, and im at the audition for wheel, where its 60 people; of those probably 6-8 will make the cut for the show. the number of people in the room is trimmed down to 21, and i am one. i never make a mistake, play really well, i get excited, heck, i am moreso for the other players, genuinely, than they were for themselves.many of my friends have been on like five game shows, and hey, i could help my own page on these matters, plus my family, right? so, we wait two weeks for a mailed letter (if it shows, youre in the pool)-mine doesnt come. of course, lots of my friends have made it on, so i feel inadequate again in my life, including a chorus director our family is pretty close with. was i happy for him? of course! i can always support other people when they get something good in their life; its about all ive got going for any kind of positive emotional state these days. my mental instabilities have always rooted from internal processing.mother claims its because, ""they can tell you were trans. thats 100 percent it."" didnt help they asked for my name as it exactly appeared on social security. i was screwed, since documentation wasnt officially changed until march of that year, but my appearance and common name were changed for about seven months at that point. then, she told me not to try out again because of what it did to me the first time. thanks for the words of encouragement! not like this is a life dream or anything, silly as it sounds.so, i let everyone down, from family, to my page, etc. they say otherwise, but thinking about what it could have done for all parties, i absolutely did. dont tell me i didnt. i could have given my site more information. i could have gotten to move the heck out of here. i could have paid some of my surgical expenses. told myself if i was just given one chance at this show, id make it. lets face it, its less about the show, as it is financial independence. im told all the time about how much happier ill be when i get a job/am out of the house, but not sure how much thats true, or even likely to happen.a rather peculiar ending disclosure here: im usually on the other end of things; i typically try to help save peoples lives, which is in part why im working with the documentarys media. i like to help people become themselves, even if its just with me, or how to do this on a larger scale. heck, i presented with my friend jazz jennings last year in front of hundreds to help encourage a similar message.im just a loser who surely is going to blow her potential, and be worth nothing, like so many others. sigh. thanks for reading all this, if you got this far, and sorry you wasted your time dealing with such an inane diatribe. just wish there were solutions out there for so many of these problems, but it doesnt seem possible. just dead ends.",2015-03-14 14:23:21,The_Running_Sloth,1

adwj6b,not sure what to do with my life anymore.,depression,"im currently in a low place in my life. ive had issues with anxiety and depression since 8 years back. its always in waves or periods. my depression can come out of no where, but can also be a result of certain happenings. 2 days after x-mas my boyfriend breaks up with me, because of his desires to have children (im childfree). i always said that if he were to change his mind, we would split up as friends. thats where we are right now. i am in a hibernation of sorts. we are still living together, but he is away for days at a time for work stuff. my uni started yesterday, and i still havent been in classes. we has assignment over the holiday, which i have still not finished. now we have another one which is due in 2 days. im sitting in front of my computer, unable to do anything. my brain is just a fog, and im having crying outbreaks. im studying to become a teacher, but im not sure i want this anymore. ive had problems at school right from the beginning, my depression waves make me miss a lot of stuff, which makes me fall behind. im finding no joy in this anymore, and i am seriously considering dropping out of uni. im thinking of getting a part time job,to start of slowly again. thinking of studying something different, because university has killed my love for the teaching profession. my days right now is spent in bed, not eating correctly, thinking of what i want in life. hoping for life to be better soon.

853wg2,i need advice on what to do with a depressed friend.,depression,"i have a friend that i got to know through uni, weve known each other for a year and a half. he is a very nice person, got good humor, and is generally a good friend. my problems with him lie within his mental problems. now, before anyone judges me, or thinks that im attacking people with mental illness; im not. i suffer from depression and anxiety myself. back to the issue: my friend had asperger syndrome, and has had depression the major part of his life. i also think he has some anxiety. * he has medication, but never takes them on the proper time. * every time we meet up, he is late (unless he cancels on me, which he does often). its not 5-10 minutes kind of late, its closer to 30-45 minutes late. it is very annoying to never have him show up on time. * his apartment is always in a big big mess. not a problem per se, but he always expects that you are gonna clean when you get there. (ex: he asks me if i could do dishes, vacuum etc. or ""if i do the dishes you can clean the living room). * he likes to play the victim a lot. he keeps giving examples to make me feel sorry for him. this sound harsh, but a lot of my friends feel that he is doing it for attention. i dont know what im gonna do. having depression and anxiety myself means i am almost always tired. and my friend almost always just expects that i will do stuff that he asks for (ex: clean his apartment, follow him to the hospital). im starting to feel like his mom, which is very **very** tiring. how can i explain to him that im getting tired of his ways without hurting him? and also while not being a douche bag. ive tried talking with him about him always being late, and him taking care of his apartment, all i get for an answer is : ""i know"". and then nothing happens. we as a friend group are close to having an intervention for him, because we all feel like he needs to change some how. im very open for a discussion, am i a bad friend who cant deal with his mental issues? advice are very much welcome.

71ilwg,feeling alone on my 25th birthday,depression,"this is mostly going to be me rambling and getting stuff off my chest. turned 25 today. id be lying if i said that it didnt bother me. kinda feeling the age crisis. thats not really the point tho. i just feel like theres a lot of things hitting me at once, and im in a slump right now. i usually get these slumps every now and then, and they last anything between a couple of days to almost a month. im in week 2 now. im back to feeling so cold and empty inside, that mixed with a sort of existential crisis. im failing uni classes, my living partner (not a bf) is away working a lot so im home alone, my apartment is a mess right now, im on my way to having no income, the love of my life will never be accepted by my parents, and my few friends live far away. its like i said earlier in my text, i feel like im cold all the time. like a chill that never goes away. the only places i dont feel cold in, are in a burning shower or under my blankets in bed. and thats just the problem...why would i go out into the cold, unforgiving world when i can just lie down in my safe space in bed? i try to do the bare minimum every day, make sure i have food in my fridge, make sure i eat at least 2 meals a day, do laundry when needed. but still i feel like i should be doing so much more, i feel like such a disappointment. my 2 siblings have gone through school and work just fine, and they are doing really well. and i dont hate them, i just feel like i am the disappointment in the family. ive tried medication, i was on sertraline for a while. id heard good stuff about it, like ""saving peoples lives"". well it didnt do me any good. it was a long process to getting the body used to medication, and my entire body went haywire. the nightmares were the worst. i would have more nightmares than ""normal"" dreams. when my body had finally adjusted, it didnt do much, i just felt i was in a haze all the time. i felt...nothing. not even positive emotions. so i quit. which means im just back in my normal routine. sometimes i feel good, sometimes im down in the slump...as i am right now. this isnt exactly an post asking for help or answers, i mostly wanted to write all of this down. maybe someone else here is feeling the same?

9m8dy3,rant about current situation,depression,"hello 2nd or 3rd time posting on here. this will be a long wall of text probably so im sorry for that, thus the early warning. last year at the end of november i went with my family to kansas for my grandpas birthday. i loathed the thought of leaving my friends house to go back to the job i worked myself to death at and my constantly bitching family. so i stayed for 3 months and was stuck in a shed with my best friend playing games and getting worse. i had no transportation and we were in a very tiny outlying town so i never got a job or made any dr appointments. i was about to pick up my friends glock and end my life when i messaged my mom on facebook and she had my one good brother come and get me to bring me home.after being back with my mom for a month and a half i still didnt have a job and didnt go to the dr. ended up getting into a big fight with my brother and sister who had their own appartments in the same building. they took my phone and took it outside and locked me out of my moms place. i called the cops to come pick me up and take me in for suicidal thoughts. they took me to a hospital an hour away and after 2 days they sent me to a very nice mental facility in yankton sd (highly recommend them).i was only there for a week and half before they released me and they ended up taking me off my antidepressant without giving me anything to replace it because they were afraid missing it a day would make me sick (sounded really fucking stupid to me. i went and stayed at my dads but quickly got sick of him because he doesnt understand me and he gets angry very fast. i saw a therapist twice while living with him but she didnt really say much or do anything. after a month of my dad i moved to another town with a friend i made at the facility.there i started seeing a doctor and a therapist and worked with the dept of labor, rehab servicies, ss, and an employment specialist. i was able to get foodstamps but only for 3 months after that i had to have proof of disability or a dr note saying i cannot work. i was very lethargic and couldnt do much before i was too tired to move. i went out with my specialist to do a work trial and passed out after 5 mins of cleaning. my friend soon got tired of me not having a job which was understandable because we both thought i would be able to work right away. once again i had to move back with my mother.saw a dr very soon after moving in and it was discovered that i had an extremely low functioning thyroid. a year prior to this blood test i had had my thyroid checked and they never contacted me with the results or informed the dr. that was right before i stayed in kansas. i was so low functioning it was an emergency for me to pick up the medacation. after a month  of being on it i felt really good was able to do things for longer and didnt feel so depressed. and then as luck would have it my mom had 5 grand come to her from her old jobs retirment fund. they had used the wrong paperwork years back and didnt give it all to her as she had requested. we used the money to move to another town with my brother and sister. but before we moved we owed over 1500 dollars to the land lord for past due rents. and the electricity had been behind 3 months for about a year. while this move was going on i was constantly treated like shit by my brother and sister who both lost their jobs 2 months before we moved. one day the verbal abuse was so bad i laid down in the living room and cried after they left.  i ended up walking to the clinic where my mother was crying most of the time. a friend of mine drove by and tried to talk to me but i broke down while trying to talk. now to current times weve lived in our new place for 2-3 weeks. the realty place that manages our property lied to us before we moved in they said they cleaned everything and fixed up the problems we had while viewing it. we got here the place was filty it had maybe been swept they painted over every window 4 outlets didnt and still dont work the living room light is non functioning as well we put lightbulbs in it and the flashed like crazy and died its a good thing none of us was epileptic. the basement came with a washer and drying but there was only 1 3 prong outlet for the washer. every other outlet in the basement and garage is from 1950 no lie and we cant use anything with them. the dryer is pluged in with a converter thingy into one of the old sockets. our stove electrecuted us when we tried to cook on it they replaced it with a slightly better less rusty one that can at least cook. the dryer was broken and the repair man told us he told them it was broken and that the fridge needed parts as well. things they  never mentioned to us. the fridge ruined 100 dollars worth of our food we had almost no money by this point. its still broken and they dont care now. we have to clean a few gallons of water out of the bottom of it every few days. my mother was set up to be transfered to the walmart in this town but the old walmart was mad and gave her a bad review and sent her points up by 5. so the new walmart refused to take her at this point which now means soon i will have no health insurance. i take 11 pills a day for (depression 2 pills, thyroid 1 pill, blood pressure 2 pills, nerve pain 3 pills, singular 1 pill, and 2 pills for my acid reflux) with the insurance its around 44 bucks a month but without its going to be somewhere near 200 dollars or more a month. therapist requires money at time of visit and i really need to see one because im at the point where im going to start carving people up for fun. i confided in my mom about how bad my mental state is im super fucked up from my childhood and being constantly bullied. i dream about hurting people all the time and when i get pushed really far i imagine all the ways i could torture people and how easy it would be to just slit my familys throats as they sleep. when i worked i would work so hard that i would get sick from over working my self and then not being able to sleep which i still cannot stay asleep at all. therapists are like 250 dollars a session and i feel like i need to see mine once a week. i also need to see a psychologist for my ptsd because it needs to be treated and each visit with one of them is like 750. im already 30 grand or more in dept from clinic visits a surgery and hospitilization from my suicide attempt. ive been trying so hard these past 6 months to get in better health ive lost 30 pounds im eating less and im trying to eat better. im taking all my pills like im supposed to. but i try and try and all i get the constant bitching  from my family because i havent filled any applications out even though im working with the dept of labor and rehab servicies still. i feel that if i start a job and have to deal with people who dont care about doing their job right that i will finnaly snap the final time and end up killing someone. ive snapped in the past and destroyed equipment at past jobs. im always angry. but i hate that about myself i hate my anger i hate who i am. i know the things i think are wrong and i want to be better. i grew up racist as hell thanks to my family but ive trained myself to be better in that regard. and i want to be a better person so bad. but everyone just keeps pushing me. im so lost i have 3 friends i can count on and talk to. im just tired of it. im typing from my soul here im not doing this for attention or for offers of anything. i just want someone to understand what im going through and how i feel. i think this is everything for now if you read this all thank you and im more than happy to talk in comments or pms if anyone has any questions or suggestions or criticism or anything",2018-10-07 23:21:10,Blade_0239,0

(topic of argument: whether or not it was begging rather than asking a favour when looking for a job) i cant exactly remember when something sparked in his mind, but he just flipped at me.ive lived a relatively comfortable, sheltered life, but there has been more and more pressure to spend less time playing around and more time working with my university studies, and work to find a part time job. for the past few months i have been tossing around a few applications (all rejection / no response) and until yesterday i hadnt dedicated much time to these (i do write my resumes to high standard, dont get me wrong).basically, when my dad flipped, he smacked his hands down on my desk (rattling some parts of my pc out of place so hard for perspective) and yelled about me about how sheltered i am and how much of a spoiled brat i was. to summarise what he told me there were two things that he said, one - ""you are so close to getting punched in the face right now, and its not child abuse any more its straight up assault"", and two - ""if you want to be treated like an adult then leave home, theres the world (points out window).""note: my dad hasnt hit me in a while, but its happened before, and hes a controlling person with a short temper and little empathy. (did hit me once when he started shouting at me) he is known to lash out from time to time, unfortunately.the world i am being forced to live in now seems like it wont end, not the good ending where you retire, but just no light at the end of the tunnel. find a part time job, work hard at uni studies, get a better job, finish degree, get a better job from 9-5, pay off debts. which reminds me, im now being forced to pay part of my pay(possibly all) - should i get a part time job in the near-distant-future as rent. i dont know if its just my sheltered self talking here but it seems a bit much to have an 18 year old already paying rent for living at home, expect them to treat university as a full time job, get a part time job, take on lots of household chores, etc. etc.im 18, ive not been properly employed per se, but have had work experience for the best part of 6 years in the same role (paid). i havent seen a therapist nor have i confided in anyone or directly implied it, nor would i ever consider confiding, but i have more than a hunch i can relate to a lot of people in this subreddit...depression is something that runs in my family too, and it sucks that not once has anyone ever stopped to ask if i was ok. i only exist when someone needs something from me. nothing is moving in the world, im not going anywhere any time soon. i honestly dont even know why im bothering to write this up now.apologies if i come across as the spoiled brat im told i am. am i in the right here? am i in the wrong? is this the typical household? i have no reference points, no one to go to and ask.its hard to confront the situation because im being threatened to be kicked out of the house. i know, now more than ever that if i get a job that can supply me with necessary funds, i will be moving out. i cannot stay here much longer, like it or not./rant/giveup/surrender*edit - clarity",2014-11-09 10:24:08,ThrowawayJ10112,0

abhizh,my loneliness is a choice.,lonely,"the truth is i like being alone, i like my personal space and i like doing things i enjoy without being judged or having to justify doing the things i want to do.of course i feel so lonely sometimes and wish that i had someone to share things with, to have conversations with or even to be intimate with.this is a recent realization, ive had a few people in my life recently that i slowly distance myself from without even realizing im doing it.tonight was finally when i accepted what i was doing and understood why i was doing it.its the end of the year and the start of the new one, so i met up with a girl that i had met recently and been talking to a little bit here and there so we could spend new years together, its not like i didnt have fun but on my way home i realized that my new year would have probably been a lot better if i had just stayed home and done my own thing.im still lonely and i still have this feeling like i want to have someone to share my life with but the truth is the social interaction that i get between work and hanging out with the few friends i have every once in a while might actually be all i can take. the feeling of loneliness is just a side effect of the way i choose to live my life.im not really sure why im posting this here, but i guess maybe its because i think some other people here might feel the same way and maybe reading this will help them realize it quicker than i did.happy new year everybody.

adqzkc,how depression becomes suicide,depression," ok so,i promise i am not suicidal i just, thought of this analogy to describe what feelin suicidal is like, and i want to see if others agree or think its innacurateso, imagine you are on a deserted island. you walk out to look  for food, you do this for several days. as youi look, you see a certain animal here and there but you think its too cute or weird / dangerous looking to eat - some reasoning causes you to not want to eat he animal so you leave it alone and you keep going. the days go by and youre not finding foos. you find yourself starving after a week and suddenly your perspective on things changes, how you see your situation changes. you then see the animal again as you are starving. you dont even have time to think whether you want to eat it, you dont evewn ask, you just start running after it, you grab a weapon and use it to kill the animal, and perhaps, once this is achieved, you dont even cook it in a fire, you jsut eat the animal . . .the island here is depression, when you have depression, you feel isolated and like no one is around to help you. your food situation is your resources for fighting depression- maybe you find some food or resources at first but for one reason or another, you eventgually run out of it. no people are able to find you, because depression, your isolation, makes it difficult to reach out to other people.that animal you meet, is suicidal ideology. it crosses your mind , like it may cross your path, but you are able to reason with it and not commit the act. however ihn this scenario, time goes on, and you cant find a way to save yourself or be saved by others, and all of your resources get spent up, eventually you become desperate, and your brain changes. suddenly the suicidal thought comes up again- and its not something you consider / reason with this time- you just go for it without thinking and kill yourselfthis is how depression evolves into suicide.do yall think this is a good  analogy? was thinking of maybe using this for tyhe panel i mentioned earlierif this is too dark, ill delete",2019-01-08 07:21:38,StardustNyako,1

 she determined i was suicidal even though that was never even close to being said. to be fair, she was very new and im sure i made her worried, but its hard to forgive her for what came next. i was arrested from there and put into a psychiatric hospital for a week. my mother refused to visit with my son, and i lost my job. i was force fed antipsychotics that made me hallucinate further, and wasnt allowed a xanax even when surrounded by schizophrenic patients who urinated on my clothes and threw a chair at me. let me tell you - the movies where they seem to exaggerate sane people being stuck in places like that, having meds pushed down their throat and being treated like any natural reaction is them having a psychotic break - it is too accurate. on top of everything, i was injured at work and have herniated discs in my neck, which at 29 causes me daily chronic pain. i refuse to rely on narcotics, but i cant do as much as i used to. and i used to do a lot. my energy levels are horrible and i hate the way i look. i suppose thats normal when youre a skinny teenager being told youre fat by your parents. however - by all accounts, my life is a good one now. my financial problems are working themselves out. i have an amazing husband and my son is 5 and starting kindergarten and such an amazing little ball of joy and sweetness. i have a decent job which allows me some flexibility. i have a car and a bed and three awesome cats and i dont ever have to worry about not eating. i think i appreciate the small stuff so much more now. i just... i feel so disconnected. i jump back and forth between anxiety and depression and gratitude and happiness - but the negative far outweighs the positive. i work full time with people, so afterward i all too easily slip into my emotional hidey-hole and quit talking to my loved ones, what few i maintain anyway. i fight it daily because i want better for my son and my wonderful partner, but it usually feels like nails on a chalkboard. its painfully draining. ive gone from a fun and passionate extrovert to a cold and disconnected introvert. i intend to be warm and compassionate and end up being the asshole who cancels plans or doesnt text back. truthfully, just talking to people exhausts me. most people have no idea who i really am and the thought of explaining it in close proximity to those who dont understand is just draining - even those closest to me. most of those who knew me when i was in the thick of it, who went through hell and back as well... well, theyve either killed themselves or we just went our separate ways. i dont trust counselors or psychiatrists. i dont know if i trust myself to be consistent with medication. ive tried support groups but i inevitably just... stop going. a switch flips and i shut off. i dont even know what im looking for on here. this may not be completely coherent. i dont expect anyone to read through this mess or respond really. i guess i just needed to say all of it to both everyone who might actually understand, and nobody in particular at all.

adpuzq,i starved my depression out,depression,"\-obligatory trigger warning (for everything)-tl;dr: stopped eating for 40 hours, my mental problems have somehow disappeared (for now, which im already so grateful for).so i just went through a very heartbreaking break up.felt like shit, the relationship was a huge support for me and honestly, it was not anyones fault it happened. i already have depression and a lot of relationship/trust problems and all of this breakup crap made me so, so, so lonely i literally just wants to end it. i think everyone here somewhat relates to how this feel.now, whenever something like this happens my go-to move is to **eat**, a lot. ice cream, chocolate, cookies etc. im a huge emotional eater. after i binge eat i either become more defeated and depressed or i straight up purge it out. its not pretty, and i always feel a lot worse after. however, this time, i told myself to *fuck it*. how about i just slowly starve myself to death. (that was the initial thought process at least). im not gonna start eating until i either 1. feel better or 2. die.if youre familiar with maslows hierarchy of needs, you might be able to guess what happened. i continued to be very sad maybe 18 hours into not eating anything, but by the 40th hour, my brain completely decided to ignore any mental problems and just focused on the hunger.i then proceeded to eat a very normal amount and its almost as if someone has hit a reset button with my brain. i can now get out of bed, and for the first time in months i read a little (a hundred years of solitude) and will start trying to study and write again.&#x200b;the moral of the story is, if you are considering to emotionally eat, maybe try emotionally *not eat* instead.&#x200b;\---also, intermittent fasting is not right for everyone, but i think im gonna continue this 40/8 thing.

(un)fortunately costco called back...at least they paid $14/hr.im getting tired of living with grandparents and its not like i have friends here, so i might as well leave for atl soon. ive tried looking on meetup, organizing a meetup through reddit (nobody showed up), and nothing...i might check meetup again. the *only* thing keeping me here at this point is this one cool arcade bar i frequent, and working on various projects with my grandfather. i feel like an idiot for taking out 40k in loans. my degree is worthless, i have no network here, and can barely even get a job in my field. id be better off selling coke and weed to frat boys at the local college. it feels like ill never get a job. everyone has advice on what i should be doing but no jobs offers lol.a lot of the clubs on meetup are interesting, but based on the photos, id be the *only* black guy in the club...im thinking of checking out the african american hiking club...its not that i dont like hanging with other races/cultures, but ive been the only black dude before, and its kinda not all that fun.my goals for this year are to finally buy a car (my price limit $3000-$4000), to put out a music ep project, and to stop watching so much damn porn. ive downloaded a ""panic button"" and im trying to read books in place of that.lets hope atlanta is better.",2019-01-07 21:27:22,Naima_,1

adkels,the psychiatrist tricked me.,depression,"i dont know if this belongs here, but i was just so outraged and stressed from the whole situation... im not really sure where to go to talk about this. basically ive had major depression since i was 10. fast forward 11 years and  im now starting to get help for myself. i called my health insurance company for help finding a therapist (none of the therapists around me answered my calls). so. i ended up having to go 30 minutes out of my way each time to see this therapist the insurance company found. that was annoying, but not undo-able. i eventually stopped seeing the therapist when she scared me by making me think she was going to lock me up. so basically i just saw the psychiatrist for medicine recommendations. i only mention the therapist because she was basically the first red flag that i wasnt seeing the best people for my problem. they tested a few medications on me, but none of them worked. some even made my depression worse than it already was. by this time, this therapy business hired a new psychiatrist; lets call him chris. chris was obviously just out of school. he was young and definitely seemed inexperienced. he was the one who prescribed me my last medication. after a short q and a with me telling him the problems ive been having most recently, he gave me a business card that he had scribbled a name of a program the local hospital ""supposedly"" provided. he basically told me that they would be able to better help me. one important thing to note is that i clearly told him that i wasnt suicidal lately. so off i went to the local hospital. chris told me to go to the emergency entrance, so thats where i went. i showed the receptionist the card that had the program name on it and she didnt even seemed fazed. she told me to wait and someone would be with me.after a bit of waiting and a screening with who i think was a nurse, i was instructed to dress down and put on a hospital gown. i was a bit confused at this point, but complied since i figured it would make things go smoother and quicker. that and i had no idea what to expect. then i was put into a room. i wasnt allowed to have anything. i was told that i needed to wait for the crisis counselor. it was at that moment i realized what had happened. these people thought i was suicidal. like at that moment i wanted to kill myself. which wasnt the case. i tried to explain this to the nurse keeping watch, but he wasnt having it. i began to feel scared. i texted my boyfriend before going to the hospital that i was supposed to go to some program, but that was it. none of my loved ones knew what was happening to me at that moment. i was literally trapped with no way of leaving. i told the nurse through my tears that people would be wondering where i was, but he just shrugged. my boyfriend who had experience with things like this had a feeling about what happened to me when i didnt text him a few hours later. he was the one who notified my mother on where i was. im still incredibly thankful to him for that. i waited over 9 hours in that room for the ""crisis counselor"" to speak to me. about 6 of those hours i had literally nothing to do. eventually the nurse thought it would be a good idea to find the remote for the television. by the end of it all, i was incredibly stressed, but kind of passive at the same time. i had so many explosions of negative emotions, i cried so much that i felt completely drained by the end of it. i had dark rings under my eyes. i looked like absolute death. the only good thing to come out of it is that the crisis counselor seemed confused when i told him that i was not currently suicidal and that i was sent here with this card by the psychiatrist. he had me give him the card and he disappeared for a little bit. i can only hope he gave that company a harsh talking to. im never going back to either that hospital or that psychiatrist.

6v0qcs,should i feel guilty for being mentally ill?,mentalhealth,"for the past week, ive been having sleep hallucinations every. single. night. every time i try to go back to sleep, another one decides to come up. i have gotten less than 15 hours of sleep in 4 days. ive been living off energy drinks during my work shifts and naps. for a bit of an explanation, the hallucinations are most commonly spiders. now, i used to be nervous around spiders before, but i was still able to dispose of them with a napkin. now, the years of spider hallucinations have caused me to develop a very strong fear of them. i know its pathetic, but i cant help it. recently, theres been a spider problem in my house. ive been finding them around a lot. i dont know where they are coming from and ive been trying to take steps to prevent them. but they still come around and like to hang out in my room and around the hallway. ive been battling this one spider for the past 4 days now. my father killed it tonight, but before that, its been causing me trouble along with the other hallucinations. im hearing voices and hearing noises now. three nights ago i first heard these two unfamiliar male voices talking outside my door. they were speaking unintelligible things at the same time. two nights ago, one voice said something that terrified me.  i heard the sound of something heavy falling in the bathroom next to me room and then this-""bang! the spider is back."" i dont remember exactly what it said since i was in full panic mode, but it definitely said either ""bang"" or ""boom"" and something about the spider being back and maybe something about it being on the ceiling. when i opened my eyes and turned on the lights, the same spider i had been trying to kill for days was above my head on the ceiling. i lost it once more and i had to have my boyfriend come get me. at this point i was exhausted, very tightly wound and horribly skittish. my chest was burning and my heart was pounding from exhaustion. i was on the verge of tears. i knew i was going crazy and i had just woken my boyfriend up at 3 in the morning in a terror filled state. i still feel guilty about it... tonight he made it clear that i either needed to get help or he couldnt be with me anymore. weve been together for almost 5 years now and along with the hallucinations, i have other mental illnesses. ive tried to get help many times, but it isnt working out. im waiting for morning so i can call the doctor about the hallucinations... i know i need at least antidepressants and antipsychotics. tonight, my boyfriend asked if i was high because of my obsession with this spider that had been terrorizing me. he made it clear that it was ridiculous and he got upset with me because he got a flat tire running over a nail in his driveway. he was coming to get rid of the spider once and for all even though i told him i was going to take care of it with a vacuum. he admitted to waiting to long to fill his tires with air and that contributing to his tire troubles, but he still came off as blaming me for it.i offered to pay for his new set of tires, but he declined saying he would break up with me if i left him money. he said he was fed up and he would deal with it himself. should i be feeling guilty for my mental health problems causing so much trouble? i definitely feel guilty, but i also feel confused with his outburst at me... he said that it was okay up until today.. i even apologized... i know this fear is irrational, but ive had hallucinations of spiders crawling all over me for a while now and im just so terrified of them now...

3nta6i,suffering in silence; undeserving of life,depression,"this is hard for me to post, but ive (21m) been struggling with depression for as long as i can remember.  its like living with a shadow you thought was a friend, only to have it almost kill you one day.  it wasnt always like this.  i used to be a free soul, unbound by social constructs, unconscious of judgment and scorn.  and to an extent i still am relatively insular to those things now, but only because i make a conscious effort to do so.  however, things all changed when i threw myself on the sword of my own past actions, so to speak.  lets just say that i caused repeated pain to someone dear to me in ways that i will never be able to live down,  and the same probably goes for them as well.its plagued me constantly: ive tried to rationalize, ive tried to forget, ive tried to compartmentalize, ive tried to redefine morality, ive tried to apologize, ive tried almost everything i know within the bounds of maintaining anonymity.  but i think thats whats going to be my death sentence: silence is the cage to cathartic release.  no suicide safety plan or conversations with therapists will ever help because theyre all mandated reporters,  so even those deep talks feel like im feeding the some ventriloquy through the mouthpiece of a false pretense.and the worst part is i know how much i am loved by my family, yet i feel it is impossible for me to internally reciprocate those feelings for whatever reason.  i do not deserve the happiness and privilege ive been given here with this arbitrary birth on this arbitrary planet. to be honest, im not quite sure if these antidepressants will start affecting me in time.  6 months is towering over me like goliath right now.  im so tired of passively living that a passive death is becoming a more and more beautiful thing.  thank you for listening to me.good night.",2015-10-07 10:14:26,dwarfcorgi,1

8jpn63,is there a point to any of this? are we just characters in a book? do we have any control?,depression,"these are basically the questions i’ve been struggling with my whole life. were we just doomed into our current situation from the start? is it really hopeless? in order for you to be here in this life, it takes two people. so your whole life and the person you’ll become is left at their mercy. i know some of our personality is genetic but for the most part what we are is a collection of our memories, experiences. all of our experiences define who we are today, if our life went in a different direction, we would be a totally different person than the one we are now. these parents are the architects to our life. i would describe life as a tree. before you’re born this tree as infinite branches, but as you come to the world branches die one by one. any decision a parent makes cuts off many branches. by the time we get the reins, our life can only go a certain way, there is only so much potential left. if we are fortunate we’ll have parents that will give us reins to a path with high potential or if you’re like me, you’ll be left with a tree with the only branch that is death. what i was trying to convey in this paragraph is that we are not concrete or set in stone we only became who we are because of the information our senses captured and our brain processed. so what i struggle with is, what makes us unique or purposeful when we are a product of our storyline. are just characters in a book?, do we have any control?  everything we believe to be true of our self, all our insecurities, our strengths, our weaknesses. they are all learned attributes for the most part, genetics also plays a key role. athletic parents are going to create athletic babies to counter this argument i can say genes come from your parents and my tree analogy kinda works. our life was a hair length away from happiness to sadness. the only reason i’m thinking this right now is because this result my brain came up with when it processed the information from my senses. isn’t it kinda boring playing along when we are actually not authors but characters in a book by destiny? luck? i’m not trying to say i’m right, this is 100% the truth. it’ll be stupid the say that after i saw how much evolution my though went through my whole life. is there ever a true answer when everything is left to destiny? at this point i’m just so confused.

adfgx3,it feels like a hit a wall with the potential for my happiness,depression,"i have been depressed for almost over a decade and it seems that nothing i do can get me out of this depressive mode. i keep trying to pursue my passion in music and djing but that has not been cheering me up as much as it used to. i haven’t felt the spark of joy in a long time and the only time i can get remotely close to that spark is when i’m in a relationship with someone, being in a relationship also really motivates me but i have decided to stop dating because going through heartbreaks and toxic relationships were making my depression worse and causing major beatdowns to my already low self esteem. i find myself constantly trying to fill the void of emptiness that lies inside of me but it seems to do just as good as duct tape and water. i’m trying to go back to school in a few months but i haven’t been able to get excited about it and i’m worried that i won’t be disciplined enough to get the best experience out of my schooling and fully apply myself to the schoolwork. i really want to be happy on my own and i want to build my self esteem and it seems like every time i am with friends, i have nothing exciting to update them about. “hey guys, today i just sat at home, overslept, and wasted my time playing video games” is what comes up when they ask how my day has been. i keep seeing my peers accomplishing things and moving forward in life while i’m stuck in this rut giving only about a 60% effort to anything that i do. i got into a nasty habit of partying 4 years ago that has slowly made me lose myself more and i just recently stopped partying because the heavy drinking and substances i was doing were only causing my problems to worsen in the long run. i feel like i often find myself seeking outside approval from others and that i am a chameleon of everyone around me. i never got to really know who i am so how can i love myself if i don’t know who i am? i work at a retail store and at work i feel very drained and don’t fully put in the best of my effort. i see all of my coworkers talking to eachother, getting praised by the managers, and getting along. i feel very left out at work and putting on a fake smile for customers makes me cringe. i know life is short and i really want to make the best of my time rather than passing it. it sucks to say that i don’t value life as much as i should and i felt very indifferent about a car accident i was involved in that nearly killed me. i get jealous when i see people enjoying themselves on the simple pleasures of life like dancing at bars, cheering at shows, and watching movies etc. i’m often told that i’m too smart for my own good and i believe that my awareness of the planet and what people do sort of makes me feel bored in a way. depression and heartbreaks are awful but nothing feels worse than being almost literally bored with everything you do.. i really dislike the holidays because they slap me in the face with “you should be more happy it’s (insert holiday here)” i would give anything to be motivated, find myself, and be passionate again.

9iakmn,why it’s hard to reach out in a crisis/suicidal state.,SuicideWatch,"i don’t claim to speak for everyone on this matter as everyone has different experiences but it is not as easy as people think to reach out to others when in a crisis/suicidal state. this is because you are so far into negative thoughts, self image, and self doubt etc. that you fail to believe that even your bestest of friends are really there for you, at least for me that is. i have had many crisis and suicidal ideations, even went to the hospital once for an attempt. i find that in this state i can’t ever make my mind on who to reach out to or call because i’m always telling myself that “i’ll get over it” or that “i’ll waste someone’s time” when i reach out. it is not easy to ask for help in a crisis state and i believe this is why a lot of suicides happen unannounced. i wish the suicide hotline wouldn’t come storming in to your home with a team of police when you mentioned that you want to “end it all” to them. i find that all you need in a crisis moment is just someone to be there for you and take you out of your vortex. they don’t have to fix your problems, just take you out on a car ride or simply hanging out does so many wonders and really saves lives.

7zewli,just a trick that helped me deal with a good portion of my depression,depression,"i believe a big part of depression is self forgiveness. i’m obviously no therapist nor am i a statistician by any means but from talking among mutual depressed friends, i came to a conclusion that among our bad self image, we tend to torture ourselves with memories and think back about moments where we felt humiliated, regret, rejected etc. and we bring those things into our present sad mood. the tip is to realize experience and negative moods as separate entities. its a way to reprogram your brain to practicing letting go and self-forgiveness.your experiences(things you did, choices you made, people you have met, accomplishments/failures etc.) are what built who you are today and what got you where you are now, you are probably wondering“but these are the things that made me depressed now??” but just bear with me here:these experiences by no means define who you are as a person! people are always capable of changing, they just have to choose to start and to trust. look for a place to forgive yourself for the shit you did back then or the grief you went through. the big picture is that these experiences are lessons that either strengthened you or taught you an important lesson. you will never repeat the same mistakes you constantly think back about and eventually when allowed enough time to, you will fully process that grief. pain has a shelf life so don’t let anyone tell you to hold that shit in. we are not sad simply because of the choices we made and what happened to us in the past, we are sad because sadness just simply is, just like happiness, the world, negative/positive and everything else. we stay sad when we keep telling ourselves over and over again that we fucked up and we think something is punishing us when in reality we are punishing ourselves. i’m still battling depression myself, it is very tough, especially for very active minds. but no matter how many things i improved in my life, i still felt the sadness, somedays for no reason at all only to find my brain trying to dig up a bad memory to give it reason.hope this helps, just keep faith and forgive yourselves!",2018-02-22 15:34:46,savagesaucez,1

""why couldnt i get my act together before it was to late?"" its hard to explain.. i hurted my mother and stepdad with my selfishness and stupidity, and now both of them are dead.  theres no way i can make amends now.  once you die,  its over.  youre fucked..  i remember as a child,  i had this feeling my mom was going to die pretty soon,  but i will always push that voice in the back of my head.  and now look... the only people i can make amends with are my stepslibings.  and i lost contact with them 14 years ago. reconciling with them is basically pointless,  to much time has passed.  including,  im pretty sure they have families of their own.  its to late.. im sorry for rambling guys,  but this burdening me down since i was 7 years olds.  sometimes i feel like im in a bad dream,  and once i wake up none of this shit is real.  the guilt, regret, and self loathing is the biggest factor to my depression.  and i see no solution to get it fix.  how do you guys deal with this type of burden? how do you live your lives everyday,  knowing you cant make amends with the loved ones you hurted or make up lost time? i honestly feel like im living in a bad dream.  since im the last person alive for my family line  carrying the last name of lewis i cant wait to i die.  i dont have to be burden with this pain and i dont have to spread down a family line that is already fucked up.  i just need some people to talk to and can relate to my pain i been feeling for 14 years.  my advice to you teenagers or anyone out there,  get your shit together with your love ones or even strangers.  because once theyre dead and you didnt make amends with them youre fuck.. im being totally honest with you.sorry for my grammar mistakes.

8n5rw0,how to let things be? how to become numb? story below,depression,"forgive my grammar mistakes.  i think for a while now,  i know what is causing my depression and there is no way to fix it. my childhood was not good. i seen a lot of things children should not look at or experience. first off i never knew my father. all i know he was a drug addict and he is dead. i dont even know his first or last name.  my last name comes from one of my mom ex boyfriends.  so technically i have real last name. my mother passed away when i was 7 years old. she died from aids. before her death, i had this strong gut feeling she is going to die soon.  i swear.  i was around six years old when i had that feeling.  i had no idea she was sicked. my mother death played a major part to my depression. however, there is something else.  my stepdad and his children.  my stepdad was an outcast by society standards.  they will label him ""white trash"". originally he was from louisiana.  half of his family was kind and sweet.  the other half was racist... before my mom went to the hospital for the last time,  me, my stepdad, and i went to the beach. that was the one very last time i will spend time with the both of them at the same time.  shortly after my mom went to the hospital for the last time.  during that time my stepdad was stressed about the bills and my mother in the hospital. including,  i was always getting in trouble in school... i found out later during my life,  when my stepdad left me alone in the apartments at night,  i was told he was smoking crack in the apartment complex washing and dryer room.  my stepdad was hiv and an acholloic. the stress of my mother dying in the hospital, me acting up constantly as a child,  and his own kids pushed him to start doing drugs.  i remember the last time he talked to me. i was in my room watching cartoons and he told me he will deal with me later because i got in trouble in school that day.  i remember looking him in the eyes and just shrugging my shoulders at him... the next morning my life change forever.  as i was about to walk out the front door for school,  i remember it liked yesterday, my stepdad pushed me on the couch and start choking me.  i swear on my life.  i was so afraid. while he was choking me, his son watched in fear. my stepbrother and stepsister was probably 13 or 14. anyway i somehow escaped my stepdad and ran to aunt apartment door.  my mom and aunt used to lived in the same apartment complex . after that incident my aunt raised me to i turned 18. the last time i heard from my stepsister was on the phone before my mom died in the hospital.  i remember her promising me i will hang out with her again.  that never happened.. my stepsister was in the same room with my mother when she died.  on the day of my mothers funeral my stepdad was supposed to attend,  but i was told he was arrested on a warrant on the day of my mothers funeral.  as a small child,  i always knew i will be alone.  i swear.  my depression mainly  comes from missing my mom, stepdad, stepsister,  and stepbrother.  i have a lot of self loath.  i wish i was a better child to my mother  before she was in the hospital/dying in the hospital! i wish i didnt cause my stepdad to start doing drugs because of the additional stressed i caused on him! if i had honestly been a better child a lot of my depression will not be here! i cant say sorry to my mom,  because she is dead! i cant say sorry to my stepdad because he is dead! i have no idea if my stepsister or stepbrother are okay!! i have no idea what happened to them! they were kids too! there is a possibility theyre dead too! and if theyre not dead,  theres a chance they forgotten about me... i think about my past everyday. i always wonder how things will play out back then if i wasnt so stupid as a child .. i have no idea how to find my stepdad and stepsister.  i just want to make peace with them,  i swear on my life! i only know their  first name. not their  last name.  my stepdad named was todd, stepsister was amber,  and stepbrother was alex. this is where most of my depression and self loathing comes from.  i need someone to vent and talk to.. i never told anyone this.  definitely with details.  sorry for the grammar mistakes. i need help.  im not afraid to admit.  im scared and alone . i been like this since i was 7 years old.",2018-05-30 07:34:31,black-trash-man,1

93971r,everything is falling apart in life and i'm tired of acting like everything is ok,depression,"all through out high school my home life has been a mess. my older brother has serious mental issues, anger issues and ocd, and has repetitively gotten in trouble with the law to many times to count, mostly for selling drugs of all sorts and gang affiliated crimes. just a year ago, he bought two doberman puppies home with out asking, he hasnt trained them in the least bit, and they are so mentally scarred from him telling at the top of his lungs at them and keep them locked up in a disgusting room for most of the day. they are sweet dogs, but they need help, just this year they both got in a terrible fight with each other ending with both of them in critical condition. i hate having to deal with this, but i cant confront my brother about this because its dangerous as he literally hates my guts and can get physical, all i can do is watch and help make sure the dogs are safe. my parents havent fared any better, my father, the person my brother fights with the most, in unable to deal with the situation in a healthy way, and has taken to supplements, exploding at small things, and critiquing others to help himself. in a way hes the worst one as every conversation in some way belittles you or someone else, or turns into hour long rants about small little human errors. it became the job of my mom and me to contain the situation in what ever way possible (this mostly means hiding evidence that there is something wrong), i feel like im babysitting two adult children.in just this one year, i had to deal with two unwanted dogs, a swat team destroying my house, some one throwing three bricks into my house, a absolutely bloody and deathly dog fight, and having to put down my pet gecko ive been taking care for a year after my brother abandoned it (geckos are super sensative to their environment, my brothers room is gross).my two younger siblings are to young to understand the situation.it getting hard to keep everything together, its like a never ending night mare, i feel hollow inside and i cant talk about it with my mom because it freaks her out. this kind of turned into a rant, but i feel like i have to say this somewhere or its like it never happened, given the nature of how my family deals with stress. sometimes i just start crying for nothing, ive put on so much weight, and i am forced to stay home via guilt to help deal with this whole mess.i think my will power is starting to disappear",2018-07-31 02:26:29,GalacticLawnmower,1

96jacd,the greatest trick depression ever pulled was convincing you it didn't exist...,depression,"*sadly, this was swept under in automated tooling, and it didnt get posted when it was most poignant. im not as bad today, but i can feel it on the dark side of my mind and it will come back to haunt me again, and im curious about how people will respond to it.*  i  had a line of thinking today that i wanted to bring up to people, and  that is the existence of depression, and the idea that it is almost  sentient in its way of convincing you of its existence or lack thereof.  to be clear, im not denying its presence; this last week has been  highly traumatic for me and ive pushed everyone in my life away. i  found this subreddit in a painful moment of looking for ways to die  peacefully, and then about the frequency of those who are out there who  dont want to die, but also do not want to exist. i would love nothing  more than to observe the world, if i could, and never be a part of  anyones life but merely to haunt the planet. i would settle for  complete darkness - nonexistence.but  ive got a peculiar habit, and i want to see how many other people have  this and what it might mean. this habit being the daily struggle of  believing in my own condition; there is never an episode that isnt  followed with the complete denial that an episode needed to occur. i am  plagued by a constant recurring thought that im lazy, that i could  easily achieve what i want to do if i would just do it, and that failure  to do it requires debilitating shame. which is ironic, because im  paralyzed by my anxiety and depression, but my inability to do simple  things (call and ask why my water was disconnected, telling someone why i  cant show today even though i told them for the third time i would,  applying for food stamps even though ive started the process four times  and never followed through) seems to stem from that very paralyzation.  it is one contradiction in my life out of a million: i love socializing  but i do not want to be around people, my room is a complete disgusting  mess but i cant stand dirty dishes in the sink, i believe in the  inherent good of all humanity, but humanity makes me sick.  i want to  scream out for help so badly, but bind and gag myself because ""everyone  else has it worse and nobody would really be able to help you more than  yourself anyway.""therapy never worked  for me, i cant afford medication, and i needed medicaid only once in my  life and im pretty sure its expired now. or whatever the hell happens  to medicaid when you leave it alone in a strange place like a five year  old with add. it was for a recent appendectomy that the doctor had  botched and almost killed me. after surgery i had problems waking up and  aspirated, ended up with a flash pulmonary edema, and spent the next  week in hallucinatory hell where i saw literally hell. i couldnt sleep  because every time i closed my eyes i was dying or witnessing horrendous  things. i wish at that point - and again now - that i had never made it  out. but the worst part of it is that no matter what, i manage to  convince myself that im making all of this up in my head.its  hard to tell where i am at the moment with this last episode. i say  ""episode,"" but my general demeanor is at least functioning. ask me any  day of the week how im doing, and the response will always be ""im  hanging in there"" or ""im still alive, i think."" i find myself - as  noted in the song of the same name - comfortably numb. i accept that my  life is pointless and headed nowhere, and i fight on with the hope that  ill just poof! wake up one day and start my music career (even though  deep down i know thats not how it will or ever has worked). the only  solace i can find outside of sleep is playing wow and listening to arin  hanson and dan avidan from game grumps, and occasionally ill hear dan  talk about his depression and i wish i could just... pull him up to me  and ask him what the \*\*\*\* he does to stay alive. but... the last few  days have rendered me unable to communicate with others, an inexplicable  dread that pushes me down whenever i think i might be able to talk to  someone, a deep-seated fear of achieving any minor obligation. i always  believed i would never try to kill myself because i know how badly it  would hurt others. these few days have made me question that resolve. i  cant tell you if im on an ""upswing"" or a ""downswing"" because when  everything is dark and youve spent so long rolling around in it, you  cant tell so easily whats up or down anymore.so  how is it that, at the end of all this, i can let the thought creep in  that this isnt actually a problem? that im taking advantage of a  generational ""fad"" and blaming all my problems on something i cant  claim responsibility for because im lazy? how can you tell someone who  normalizes dread and fear that their depression is a real issue? and  lets be honest, what would change my mind that id be worth fixing out  of the billion of us ants that continue on in history without a passing  thought?  i began this journey wanting to be a musician, a star, a  somebody.unique.you know, just like everyone else.",2018-08-11 22:45:57,Merancapeman,1

ade39x,it’s like i was in a terrible accident and i have realized i can leave the car but i can’t stop looking at all the blood and i don’t trust the people there to help.,depression,"does anyone else struggling with depression and the failure to thrive feel like medications just make them so numb they can’t actually engage their trauma? can’t learn from pain?  can’t address character flaws and historical problems?a little background. actually a lot...sorry this is really so long.  you can jump to the tldr...i have been fighting depression, add and anxiety pretty much since i was 12--im approaching 50 now. the roots of these diagnoses i suspect are deep in my parents early divorce, probable attachment disorder and intermittent emotional neglect and psychological abuse.  i was diagnosed at 16 and had some good luck with anti-depression meds at first.  my mainstay coping mechanisms, though, developed in early college:  alcohol and weed.  i did take meds intermittently, but never felt great about big pharmas game and the results were so mixed that although i was often using anti-depressants and stimulants, i mostly tried to self medicate, plus drinking and getting high were socially acceptable and encouraged in my friend groups.  i also fell in love in early adulthood, and 18 years later i’m divorced with a (now 10 year old) son.  and although we had a good 12 years, the final years of marriage were awful.  the sobriety of parenting together undid us, and i firmly believe it was in no small part because we no longer were able to numb out on booze together.  plus i was not able to get it up (thanks years of weed and meds!) which of course did not help the reduction of intimacy that often follows a first child.  years of resentment boiled up as we proved to be more and more out of love as our beautiful baby became a boy.  my ex dealt with our dysfunction by sleeping with my trusted “friend”. the ugly end of literally the only beneficial family relationship i had left, that seemed unshakable only years before, also happened at about the same time as my career collapse, something that also seemed unlikely.  in that same year my marriage shattered, i had to walk out of the elementary classroom i taught to be tried before hr for the decline of my abilities, only to lose my composure so entirely that i had to go home mid-day without even saying good-bye to the students.  i went on long term disability the next day for my mental state and never returned to that school or classroom teaching.   my son’s age at the unraveling of our relationship, being almost identical to my own when my folks split, caused any healing i had done from that trauma to explode and fester.  i was going through all this as we marched through the stages of pre-trial divorce.  at the time i was given more and more meds to help me through, and i kicked regular substance use entirely, dropping decades worth of friendships (built on substances) from my life.  now it is almost 6 years later and i have had some successes (reduced my meds, still living without substances, steady employment) but have very little to show for a life at my age.  yes i am a consistent and loving dad (i know that is not a small thing, and i’m proud of that) with 50% custody but my income is just barely enough to allow me to live in the gentrified neighborhood my son knows and loves, that is near his mom, his school and his friends.  i have a career i can handle without having to be on tons of meds (nannying for a wealthy family) but i do not have any growth opportunities there, no prestige, no long term plan, no benefits, no retirement.  i am living paycheck to paycheck.  and even though i did have a positive relationship after the divorce for a couple of years, i am alone now and after a year of online dating and some near misses, i feel like from the outside i am a man without a future, without money, without an extended family and without ambition (beyond not being depressed).  although i look pretty good, i have persistent foot pain and low energy. i feel like i stink of mid-life collapse and i am losing faith that i will ever be able to attract anyone who can help me be the person i am capable of being, someone that i can love and be loved by.so back to my question:  since my sobriety and recent reduction of medications (this past year), i have become much less numb to my pain and tragic history. i am feeling all the feelings. as i have made my life smaller and more manageable i have tried to confront the feelings that drive so much of my inner conflict.  i have delved into many books, self-guided classes and attempts at living a more healthy life.  i have gone deeper into psychotherapy than i ever could have on all those meds, but i am so deflated and tired  from the depth of the lows, that i wonder if really feeling my feelings is going to help me anymore.  i have been able to find a few core things that i can tell really do help me (yoga, exercise, journaling, low-inflammation dieting, meditation) but i cannot seem to make any of them actual habits.  it’s hard to take on new habits alone, with almost no community and little discretionary income to invest in myself.from reading and listening to lots of books (on attachment, psychology, self-help, mindfulness, etc) i have been left with the overriding feeling that addressing my problems starts with developing good habits.  that if i only improve my character by developing better mental toughness then i will no longer live my traumas over and over again, and i’ll be able to use self-discipline to move on and contextualize my past so i can thrive in the present and future.  my therapist sees encouraging signs in our sessions, but my psychiatrist is very concerned at my plunging scores on depression and anxiety screenings, and is consistently urging me to consider upping meds, returning to old prescriptions or trying new ones.  the self-help books in my head say, “stop making excuses.  do the work.  you are better than your internal critic.”   and i so want to believe that i am capable of that--after all i am not the only one in pain, or the only one with hard circumstances. i recognize my privilege. i have had so many opportunities in my life that i feel like a whiner for even posting this.  but i am so sad.  so joyless.  so lonely.  and i don’t trust myself to help me out of this--but i don’t trust meds even more!\*\*tldr; i’m aging, lonely, heartbroken and broke.  and although ive taught myself a lot about how people deal with these problems and become sober, i am struggling to develop any good habits to help me out of this.  i want to stay off of meds so i can feel my feelings and grow, and although i feel like i can see how that would look, i often feel paralyzed or unable to consistently practice the habits to get there.  do i take more meds and compromise my awareness of reality?  and suffer side-effects that seem unacceptable?  or persevere through the pain, to take on the demons?  how can i just keep at this and trust myself--despite the persistent lack of faith i feel in myself?   can anyone who has been in a similar place relate to this and share what worked in your experiences?\*\*&#x200b;it’s like i was in a terrible accident and i have realized i can leave the car but i can’t stop looking at all the

adccir,relapsed last night after a year of being clean...,selfharm,"i been dealing with depression, anxiety, and self harm for a while, but it felt as though i kicked my sh habit, mostly replacing it with weed. however, the fogginess in my brain that weed gives me is causing me to fall behind in college, so for 2019 i decided to give up smoking. my (ex)girlfriend of 5 months also broke up with me in mid december, and that hurt a lot.**background:**her and i met in the fall of 2017 in our first semester of college. we lived in the same dorm and quickly bonded over similar music taste. we became best friends and she even gave me a stick and poke tattoo of the sagittarius symbol, my astrology sign, on my thigh. to me, that tattoo was a symbol of how happy i was at college, unbeknownst to me, the elation would only last for that semester...we began hooking up for a week or two and then abruptly stopped, but the friendship was still strong. it stayed that way for about year, until this summer, when we both confessed our love for each other. she was my first love, but despite that, she still caused me pain. over the five months of dating, she broke up with me twice, the second one being the final time.... so far... she has started hinting at maybe picking things back up upon return from winter break.this has been a complicated time for me and my emotions have been all over the place. i have been actively working to combat my depression and ive been seeing great improvements, but ive also had to fend off very close counters with taking my own life (last night being one of those, which i will get to at the bottom if youd rather skip to that). i hadnt cut myself since finals of fall 2017 and i had been working on creating a more rigid daily routine, which was boosting my outlook on life. on all levels, i want her back. i still love her. why wouldnt i? i didnt want things to end, she was the one who broke up with me. however, i also know shes not good for me. during our most recent break up i reach insane levels of instability and irrationality. these feelings were brought on by a specific incident; when she came to my dorm room, drunk at 3am one night in december.  this was a couple days after she had broken up with me. she had ended things because she questioning everything and didnt feel like she was in the right place. she wanted to work on herself. however, these feelings were not long-lasting and the very next morning she texted me, telling me she had made a mistake. i held my ground and told her id consider restarting the relationship, but not until after we had some time away from each other to think. we still kept in semi-frequent contact. things were cordial, but not flirtatious in anyway. **one of the worst nights of my life:**the night she had come over, she had texted me saying she has a few more things she wants to say and would like to come over to my dorm room. i didnt respond until about 8 or 9 pm saying, ""sure, come over."" she didnt respond until about 2am, asking if it was still okay to come over. i  was sober and naively said yes, because it was a weekday and i wasnt expecting her to be drunk.she shows up around 2:30/3:00 am, and i can tell she has drank, which she admitted to. she was being very flirtatious and trying to make some moves (wanting to sit in my lap, etc.). i declined and told her it would be best if she would go home, and then offered to drive her back to her dorm, as i was sober. halfway into the car ride she begins sobbing, explaining how shitty she feels. i begin to console her, but at this time, i was aware that it was not in my interest to take her back, despite every neuron in my brain telling me to do so. it wasnt long before i was sobbing uncontrollably, to a point where she stopped crying, realizing how fucked up of a situation she put me in. we sat outside her dorm in my car for like 15 minutes, all the while im crying. she eventually leaves, but i dont stop crying. through my tears i start to drive back to my dorm, and, despite her absence, my mental state continue to deteriorate. had it not been for my 1.5+ years of training with my therapist i am confident i would have drove my car into a pole. but i was able to recognize my downward spiral and put a stop to it. i park the car and walked the rest of the way to my dorm. this was by far my most unstable night.she apologized the next morning, but i was never able to get over how inconsiderate she was of my feelings, mostly because she is aware of my mental state. even knowing that she acted the way she did.**last night:**last night was entirely my fault, i got really drunk and consequently, depressed. for the past month, ive been tripping myself up over this tattoo she gave me, a constant reminder of her. i hit a breaking point and just wanted it gone. i dismantled one of my razor heads as i had done before and went to work disfiguring the small tattoo on my thigh. the cuts ranged in depth, one in particular is deep, but none are serious enough to cause concern. i cant count how many i did, probably 15-20 on the tattoo itself. but that wasnt enough for drunk me... after i was satisfied with my work on the tattoo, i carved ""fuck you"" adjacent to the slashed tattoo. i remember cutting my thigh, but i dont remember who the you was referring to, me or her. i have a feeling it was me. i wrote it upside-down on my thigh, so its legible from my perspective, but upside-down from an outsiders perspective. and i cant imagine saying ""fuck you"" to her, i still fucking love her man...i feel pretty shitty about relapsing... i was making such great strides and i really didnt see this coming. and besides, now im gonna have to explain to future girls why ""fuck you"" is carved next to a slashed tattoo on my thigh.if you read this, thank you. i just needed to get this off my chest. im not giving up on making my life better, but god dammit this shit is hard.if anyone wants to chat, ill probably be active for the rest of the night. i just finished my 4th beer, but im done after this. we dont dont even have to chat about this, i got some gnarly music recommendations and ill be playing old school runescape all night.",2019-01-07 03:16:59,Iiwets,1

adagh7,concrete defense walls (trigger warning),depression,"almost every day i feel like im drowning from loneliness.  in high school i had a very dependent, toxic, on-off long distance relationship which set my standards extremely high for the level of mental intimacy i need in a ""real"" relationship.  were still friends but not on the same level.  during the same time period, there were two guys who were dating each other and almost every day (for however long it was) they would kiss and lick and touch me and talk about how they wanted me in a threesome, and both of them assaulted me privately on separate occassions which is when i started to understand what was going on.  for most of high school (for tons and tons of reasons) i was either blacked out or dissociating.  if i was in an uncomfortable situation (i.e. being sexually harassed) i wouldnt mentally realize what was happening, but i would laugh nervously and my body would try and wiggle out/push away.  only a week later would i see what had happened.  on top of that, i may have been molested as a child, or at least exposed to explicit media which created fake memories and made me believe id been molested.these are the thoughts ive been obsessing over when i think about why im so lonely.  how i cant connect with anyone on any level, touching in the smallest ways activates my fight or flight mode, and even seeing pda makes me sick.  it feels like im never going to break these walls down.  i want to put myself out there, make more friends.  be intimate with others.  feel fulfilled.  depression and aspergers makes it difficult on top of trauma.  my interests are narrow, my behaviour is stunted, my hygiene/self care is worse than desirable.  im just scared.  scared that ill never break my walls down and be alone forever.  scared of what someone else will do if i get close.  scared that i wont find anyone even if i can try.  my medicine is working well but i gave up on therapy and i feel like theres nothing else i can do to get help.new years resolution: grab fear by the balls and find locals to hang out with.",2019-01-07 00:03:35,zbdb13,1

980dxp,i don't remember the last time things were this okay,depression,"title is kind of a lie- i was having a pretty okay time back in the summer of 2016, but i dont think that counts because i was drinking and doing a lot of drugs which started a year-long psychotic episode.my last psychotic episode ended on july 16th after a failed suicide attempt.  since then, i finished filing for disability and ive been focusing on my art and started selling things on ebay.  dont get me wrong, though.  i only have two friends who i dont talk to much right now and so almost every night im incredibly lonely to the point of crying, and ive been getting angry a lot lately, and my parents got a new dog that scares me, and im cutting myself at least once a week...but its okay.  because the first time since 2012, i am thinking about my future.  yes, i still get upset and suicidal often but im looking forward to the future and i dont want to die anymore.  i actually was legitimately excited for two days for the first time in such a long time, and i hated it.  i had those sickening butterflies because i was so excited, constantly thinking about 2-3 years from now when i get accepted for disability and im consistently selling things on ebay and etsy and i get to sell my art at art fairs and i get to decorate my house as ugly as i want to and live by myself with my own rules and i wont have to live with the mess that four other people make in the kitchen that gives me paranoia about contamination.ive been stubborn and waited for years.  ive rejected all medicine because i hate the side effects or i just dont feel like taking it.  ive accepted that its my choice to not get better, and ive been at the whim of my suicidal delusions and fucked up hormones since i was 15 years old, maybe younger.  and now im here.  my brain was so exhausted that it numbed out all my feelings of wanting to die.  my delusions have been nearly invisible for almost a month.  i cant be certain that this okay mindset is going to last even through the weekend, but its here now and i think that matters for something.i stopped caring about myself a long time ago, and i still dont.   several weeks ago i would think to myself that i wish i was still suicidal because it gave me hope that there was an end to things at some point in the future.  i said ""if my brain and hormones want me to be suicidal, then i will be.  if they want me to feel decent, then i will be.  but i couldnt care less about making an effort myself to be one way or the other.""and now my brain wants me to feel decent.  i did nothing, and i succeeded.  i cant make any prediction how this war will end, but i won this mid-year battle.  after typing this post, i actually feel fucking fantastic.  right now its just hit me that i am here, i am truly okay for the first time in my life, and even if i still have mood swings, im fucking winning right now.  i never would have expected that i would have been able to feel this way just two years ago, or two months ago.  im a fucking winner.",2018-08-17 10:51:50,zbdb13,1

ad87tu,considering quitting ssri's...,depression,"hey guys. ive had depression and anxiety my whole life. it runs in my family and unfortunately i inherited it. ive tried all sorts of anti-depressants over the years with only minor success. but about 8 years ago when i was going through a particularly bad phase with my anxiety and depression, i was prescribed 3 medications: 200mg of sertraline, .5mg of clonazapem 3x a day, and 1mg of risperdone 2x a day.the risperdone is supposed to be helpful for obsessive thoughts at low doses, and i must say that it has helped me immensely in that regard. the benzo, well... its a benzo and it works lol. its helped greatly with my anxiety.but as for the ssri, it also seems to help with my anxiety, but not really my depression. in fact, ive come to realize that over the past 8 years, ive been going further and further into depression. but maybe not in a classical sense, its more of having no emotions at all and feeling like i care about nothing.ive gained a lot of weight, become increasingly anti-social (i basically never leave my house expect for work and essentials), and stopped caring about all the things i once loved. put it this way, im a guitar player since age 11. i took lessons for many years and even went to college for music. today, i dont even own a guitar. i sold them to pay bills when i was unemployed a few years and havent had any interest in playing again. it seems strange that such a huge part of my life doesnt seem to matter anymore to me.so basically, my anxiety has gotten much better, but my depression has gotten much worse. i realize there is no magic pill and theres a lot of factors that can cause depression, but after trying so many different ssris and never really having true success, im starting to feel that their doing more bad than good. ive read that they can make you emotionally ""numb"", and thats how i feel, and have felt for many years now.has anyone felt better off of ssris or other similar medications? what are your experiences? im considering going down by 50mgs every two weeks and see how i feel. thoughts?",2019-01-06 20:30:59,BAN666,1
ad7zyo,depression allowed me to observe the grim reality we sometimes live in,depression,"let me start off by saying that i recognize that theres good in this world, and that there are good people, theres no arguing against that because ive seen it and i experienced it and some humans are just gems. i also realize that im depressed and this will affect my outlook on life, but i will try to give you the raw picture as it is.i have certain characteristics that are, generally speaking, not appealing to most people. ive experienced it ever since i was a kid. i clearly remember certain occasions where people would pamper and speak to other children but ignore me, and growing up, i always got bullied at school (because of my looks and background) and this affected me heavily because i still feel to this moment that most of my cynical emotions and behaviors come because of the emotional stress that i felt back then over a period of 8 years. over the next few years, i took a lot of risks in life that just worked amazingly for me, so i thought that yeah, things do get better eventually. but during this period, i was also under stress because i was doing it all alone, doing the climb alone without hearing much encouragements or support.i didnt let that affect my grades nor my vision for the future, because i always thought that in life things just tend to get better, or problems just tend to disappear, which is true, but i remember that certain unlikable characteristics might appear more as negatives to most people than positives, in the end we are just biological creatures and our brains like to think in patterns. which led me to be very skeptic of religion and eventually i started having existential crises that are stuck with me to this day, and theres this one, very dark thought that lingers in my mind and that makes me scared of reality. the thought is that life is harsh and brutal, theres no ultimate justice, if you have certain unappealing characteristics that other perceive as unlikable, then naturally you will get left out and not be special in other peoples eyes, its just the way nature is. if somebody treats you bad today and tomorrow and after tomorrow, it doesnt mean that you might have a good day in the future or a good tomorrow just because shit happened to you, and i think religion really affected how i viewed this, and the moment i left it just all made sense.the word ""eventually"" is disappearing from my book, because i always had that hope you know, that i might get to know people eventually, that i might fall in love eventually, that i might have someone who supports me eventually, but im now pretty sure that wont happen unless because of some random chance that i meet someone or some people out of the 7 and a half billion people on earth, which im starting to lose interest in. i know there are a lot of people like me out there and yes, we might meet someday and share an amazing life or friendship, but the more people i meet the less trustful i become, the more cynical i want to be. do i really want to expose myself to all people and waste time and energy so that maybe, just maybe they happen to be good people?people befriend me so that i could help them, this has happened on so many occasions that ive become really doubtful of peoples motives, and even though every now and then i get a good person in my life, they eventually either turn out to be fakes or they go in another direction in life. i have become really cynical, and im loving it and hating it at the same time. on one side of the coin, im now more relaxed because i dont give a fuck about people anymore, whereas before i would try my best to present the best image of myself because... hope. on the other side im lonely as fuck but content that people wont hurt me anymore. i mean the only person that i think loved me unconditionally and really saw through me was my mom but now shes gone.this eventually led me to the following question: why risk getting someone into my life when i know that theres a big chance that later on i will need to get over them? (which takes a lot of energy and time on my part, which is basically wasted time)i keep seeing the bad in people, i know theres good, i swear i do, i even know there are amazing folks out there, but the rest are just kind of... i dont know..this is leading me to become a lot more cynical, which further worsens the case for me. at the same time, i dont want to take risks with people, because im the type of person who prefers deep and meaningful relationships with one or two people rather than having 10 friends that i know little about or dont catch up with often.""life is tough you should just grow up"" is bullshit and should rephrased into ""most people are shit and you need to learn how to deal with them"".",2019-01-06 20:09:18,GreatWizardOfSverige,1

(x-post forever alone),SuicideWatch,"sigh. i let out a sigh of relieve from both mental and physical exhaustion as i sat down on my chair. for the first time in a long time i told myself i am letting myself rest, from the job i walked out on, from the self-awareness of my ugliness that returned as soon as i quitted my job, i turn to the only comfort i know, the faers on reddit who are all in the same shoe.i am tired of being overshadowed by my cousin. im tired of being made fun of for my ""asia-face"", im tired of the seeing ""good looking asian"" who look caucasian who are treated so well relative to our treatments. im tired of the memories of those people like my cousin telling me how this is all just in my head while receiving praise, friendship and admiration from the same people who bullied me in school. i cant stop thinking about ""what if i look like him"" in everything i do, the other day i literally had this thought in my head while waiting in line to meet a disney princess that she probably wouldnt be freaked out if i looked like my cousin instead (good thing she was very professional and kind, thanks elsa). im tired of directing my mind to a job that does not advance my skills that i thought could be my source of confidence.i am so depressed even watching a simple show is unbearable, its almost 99% of the entertainment out there are prejudice toward ugly people. movies and shows portray their character plot lines as if ""meeting a girl at a coffee shop"" is something natural and normal, neglecting the impossibility of such scenarios for people like us. i can no longer relate to any media, entertainment, i am an asian male so i do not deserve a happy ending , i am supposed to be that ugly creep who makes other people uncomfortable. i am not worth anything.i have lived in the shadow of my cousin for my whole life, i have always been told that im smart. i got an engineering degree and a well-paid job and now i got into graduate school being one of the tops applicants. i have been told that im kind, i have a good heart blah blah blah, and i have told myself that i have everything it takes to help others, i have intelligence, kindness, and most importantly experience with misery and suffering which motivated me to help others at my job, with my salary and in my free time, but if i can choose , i would choose to be a selfish, stupid and good looking jerk.but you know what is the worst nightmare for someone who defines himself with such a high standards of output? thats right, that he is actually incompetent, and he only did ""well"" at his job because his job requires little intellectual output, that if he was to die now he would have nothing to show for except for his misery. everything he defines himself with is no more than a false sense of inflated ego to compensate for his ugliness.""if you are already have nothing, what else do you have to lose?"" ""the hope that if you tried you can in fact be happy""i let out another sigh of relief as i finish typing this lengthy post, contemplating if i should just rest forever in this chair, never to wake up ever again.",2017-08-30 08:28:54,killerofpain,1

ad560h,"1 woman, 1 goal and 9 years of suffering",depression,"i have had depression and anxiety for the past 9 years. i used to also have visual and auditory hallucinations due to alcohol/drugs. 2018 was the year i had had enough with being sad and decided that i was going to do all i can to be a better person, have a more well rounded life and work towards having better mental health. i’d been able to barely pull myself tgt for years when it got a lot worse because i lost a friend to cancer. i had to quit my job in aug 2017, having been unable to leave the house due to my anxiety and for the whole of 2018, i’ve been unemployed. this really took a toll on my self confidence and self worth as i felt that all my friends were moving on with their lives and i was stuck having also dropped out of college (also due to anxiety and depression). i was suicidal in dec/jan having just locked myself at home, sleeping 19-20 hours a day, barely eating anything. i probably showered once every two weeks and i never brushed my teeth. i would fantasize about death and the many ways to end my life. i had nothing to live for. in feb, something happened. i met someone. we fell in love and finally i had something worthwhile in my life. he pulled me out of that pit and i started going for psychotherapy. things kept getting better and in oct i decided it was time to try going back to work. i got hired as a waitress. i ended up being unable to work. my anxiety worsened. i would get home at night shivering from my panic attacks and i broke down everyday. eventually my bf insisted i quit and took a break, instead focusing on improving myself so that i could go back to school in 2019. i listened and i worked even harder at getting better, at using logic instead of my emotions and fact checking every thought that went through my mind. i wrote pages and pages, analysing my moods. i baked and swam and read and ran. i ate healthily and slept on time. i went twice a week to counselling. i made all my psychiatrist’s appointments. i completely stopped my consumption of alcohol/drugs. i left toxic people in my life. i made new friends, i got a dog.i had a couple bad days here and there but things became better. in fact, it became great. tomorrow’s my first day of school and i’m ready to succeed.

ad50zk,everything feels really bleak right now,depression,"i feel intensely guilty for even writing this because i know compared to a lot of people i have it super easy and i shouldn’t complain about my position in life, but i’m just not happy.i’ll try keep it brief and not ramble. my best friend is relapsing with her anorexia and i’m pretty much her only support, she has no other close friends and her parents are nowhere as supportive as they should be. over the past few weeks she has collapsed once, self harmed multiple times and had to go to an emergency appointment because she’d made herself so unwell from not eating and taking laxatives. one of the times that she self harmed i was at work and had to call an ambulance for her. i spend most of my time with her and we’re supposed to be moving in together next week. i love her to pieces but i’m scared that moving out with her is going to be too much and i’m starting to struggle with the responsibility i feel for her.i’ve had my own issues around eating in the past, i’m a lot better than i was and i don’t feel as though my friend’s ed is triggering me but i do know i still have tendencies that aren’t “normal” eating, i won’t eat anything if i want to wear something cropped/tight cos i’m scared of how my stomach looks and i’d love to start going back to the gym but i know how obsessive i get and i don’t want to fall back into the routine i had for myself of logging everything i ate and counting every nutrient. i also struggle with my body image generally and this plays on my mind a lot. i hate most of my features and i’m contemplating getting rhinoplasty if i can afford it. i’ve recently split up with my boyfriend of nearly 2 years as we stopped getting along like we should and his reliance on weed was starting to cause issues for me again. in all honesty i’m mostly okay about the breakup because i knew it had to happen and i feel like my grieving period came as i realised that he and our relationship was changing into something that i couldn’t take anymore. but i do feel pretty lonely; i’m not used to being alone and even though i know i don’t want a relationship anytime soon not being in one is sort of frightening for me. i have reasonably bad social anxiety, i find it hard to speak to new people and sometimes in conversations i just feel myself blush and get really warm and stressed for no apparent reason and i know it’s probably very visible which makes me feel more uncomfortable. fear of this happening stops me from taking part in a lot of conversations and from talking to people generally. usually seeing my parents cheers me up but whenever i go home to see them i can just see how unhappy they are, my dad suffers from depression and my mum has admitted that she’s depressed too and i can feel the strain in their relationship and how absent minded-ly my dad can be a bit of a dick to her which is pretty sad to watch when my mum is such an angel.my job is ok, but it’s not always very fulfilling and everyday waking up to go in i feel this wave of only what i can describe as genuine depression hit me as i realise that’s where i’m going to spend 12 hours of my day. it’s not what i wanna do forever, but i don’t know what career i want long term. my friend i mentioned earlier and i have planned to go travelling so i don’t wanna get set up in something permanent before that happens but we could be saving for a couple of years.i just feel so down and so lethargic all of the time, i don’t have the mental or physical energy to do anything anymore and on the rare occasion that i do i have this mental resistance to doing anything because i feel like i’m gonna do a shit job of it anyway. i’m by no means suicidal but when i lay in bed to sleep thinking about different ways that i could kill myself is really comforting to me. it’s not like i’ve planned to do any of them or have any intent to, but i think knowing that it’s possible makes me feel better.i have other friends i could speak to but they’re all busy with their own lives so i don’t get much time to speak to them and i’ve tried counselling before but didn’t find it much help. there a year long waiting list for free counselling and private is just too dear.i just wondered if anyone hear could shed any light on anything i’ve said or give any advice.edit: the only thing i am looking forward to rn is going to see foals play in may",2019-01-06 13:58:38,lwhite_72,1

92r0x9,how i defeated depression,Anxiety,"keeping it direct and simple:   1. depression is a cycle:   it is literally a cycle of thoughts that you go over in your mind, again and again, not letting yourself let go of these toxic thoughts. i came to this realization through therapy and decided to distract myself from every last thought. you have to be able to catch yourself doing it, recognize it and get rid of the thought by emptying your mind by meditation or a healthy distraction. my distraction was math. i started doing math from algebra all over again and now i am taking calc 2. i self taught myself something, just to distract myself and ended up enjoying it. its also my go to thing for when i am upset, i know what state of mind i need to be in, to enjoy my subject.   2. change everything:  i changed everything about myself. i out down the weed and video games, i cut off toxic friends and even toxic family. it was hard to do but i did it, and returned to college, and held a part time job down for a short while till college picked up after meeting my math requisites. develop into a better person in all respects. go jogging, exercise, and study something. improve your knowledge and yourself, giving yourself a fresh start. 3. catch the toxic thoughts:i already mentioned this, but really it is important to do. we go over problems in our minds over and over again because the brain is naturally trying to deduce a solution. sometimes the best solution is to walk away from the toxicity. learn to leave it in the toilet and mentally flush that shit away!4. be patient:  breaking out of depression takes time, and it will happen. you will notice it. you will love it and you can do it. i was a miserable sack of shit. love your life. your life is meaningful and has value. your ancestors went through millions of years of evolution, so that you could live your life. own it. one day at a time. a new you will surface. a better, stronger, more awesome you than ever before.   good luck! i was there, and a recent anxiety attacked made me want to share. take care and be strong!

(or am i?)my field of vision is narrowing down when i think of the future. things are making less sense by the second, and my constant battle with perfectionism and the realization that no one amounts to anything gnaws at every dying breath i take. its a scary thought: coming to terms with all that is absurd in this life, yet so effective it is; after all, im one sigh away from considering a way out. everything loses its meaning, all that i feel is transient, and everything is a never-ending spiral of nothingness. my cats give me a sense of purpose in such an aimless life i lead. theyre the only creatures i care for; the only creatures whose presence will forever alleviate my lingering solitude. but animals leave you too, you know–an even scarier thought. i find myself worrying about a future that ceases to exist in my imagination. if i ignore that, i find myself dwelling on the past instead. just give me a fucking break. im held hostage by self-doubt and self-hatred; they define my binary thoughts. theyre the evil twins who dont give me the chance to enjoy what i have.my good days are determined by the intensity of my existential dread, which is why i cant remember the last time i have enjoyed a day without my thoughts ruining it. its a loophole, you see. but the trembling constant lies in the absence of a willpower. where is that, you ask? overshadowed by insecurities & all my other toxic traits. thats normal. everyone possesses toxic traits, but not everyone finds themselves utterly helpless in the hands of abstract concepts whose sole purpose is to destroy what is left of you.the fact still remains: im troubled, listless, and depressed, but i fear death more than anything. i fear the afterlife, i fear the unknown; the eternal nothingness; the endless possibilities awaiting me on the other side. its an even scarier thought to leave this world with nothing behind. to be lost & forgotten to the people you love the most. to amount to nothing again. but theres something oddly satisfying about vanishing into this bottomless pit that is called death. you return to the warm hold of lifes very mother: nothingness. ah yes, thats something we should all seek comfort in: the fact that we were born from a void, & return to it, we shall.  as much as death seems pleasing to me—as much as im in a constant search for a backdoor out of this, the pain i experience in life is cherished gravely in my heart, and no suicide would ever take that away from me.

9pu1oz,is this behavioral pattern normal? i'm really struggling with an obsessive personality,mentalhealth,"how likely is this to happen to a normal person? ive had obsessive behaviours all my life, such as phases of obsessions with things and people. however, i feel like, the older i get, the worse it is. i can find an interest (be it a hobby, an activity, a person, a movie, a band, etc) and obsess over it for months then lose interest in it almost instantly (in one or two days). i know its normal to change and people cant stay the same forever. i know its normal to grow apart from things. but i feel like theres no consistency in my personality at all, i feel like i could just lose everything ive ever loved in the blink of an eye. for instance, when i was little, i used to love a tv show (this was approximately 11 years ago) and now i found it on youtube and started rewatching it and obsessing over it - which is absolutely bizarre because the show is aimed at a relatively young audience (kids) and im 21 now. i know this will pass but i just find it very odd how i can just become obsessed or lose interest all of a sudden, for no reason at all. a few months ago i used to be obsessed with a band. i loved them and would listen to them 24/7, to the point where i was actually ignoring my personal hygiene and responsibilities because i was too busy listening to my favorite band. turns out all it took was 2 days for me to become completely uninterested in that band, for no reason. now i cant even enjoy their music on a normal level anymore. i dont know why this is happening but it makes me feel weird. also, i kinda feel bad for becoming obsessed with things and then dropping them like they never meant anything to me - because i become attached to them and when i lose interest, i find it incredibly hard to cope because i can no longer enjoy that special something that has previously occupied all my time and energy. when i become obsessed with a person its literally hell on earth. it takes me years to get over them.&nbsp;i just wish i could enjoy things on a normal level instead of suddenly being obsessed and then dropping things like they never even existed. right now im going through a really shitty time because im not currently obsessed with anything and i miss the high of being infatuated. im literally having both physical and mental withdrawal symptoms such as intense, debiliating anxiety, clinical depression, nausea and all kinds of random pains in my body.does this happen to anyone else and do you have any advice on how i should cope?",2018-10-20 16:15:33,ImaKillMyselfTonight,1
8rqxbg,difficulty finding a good therapist that can diagnose me,mentalhealth,"**sorry for the wall of text, im literally desperate**im 21 years old, female. for the past 3 years, my mental health has been in a constant state of decline. at first, my symptoms werent so intense and scary (mainly anxiety, fatigue, depressive episodes, anhedonia, etc). however, they quickly started to take a toll on my life so i started to see a therapist. i felt misunderstood (she was often overlooking my symptoms, thinking that im making them up, telling me to be ""positive"" etc) so i looked for a psychiatrist and a new therapist. the cycle of seeking new therapists and psychiatrists continued, because neither helped so i thought i needed to look until i find someone who can diagnose me properly. for the past 10-11 months, however, ive been starting to feel legitimately insane and it seems like not even professionals can get a hold on my situation. i dont know whether this is my anxiety acting up, but i feel like im starting to develop schizophrenia. i know reddit cant diagnose me, but i just feel like writing this post because i am really worried and i feel like no one understands.&nbsp;the first thing that made me genuinely worried is the **detachment** that i feel all the time. sometimes i feel so detached and unreal that i can no longer recognize voices and faces - they all look strange and unfamiliar to me. sometimes i cant really associate peoples voices with their identity, and even my own voice sounds unfamiliar while im speaking. i cant recognize my own reflection in the mirror and i cannot connect emotionally to my memories and identity, i feel like a stranger in my own body. i feel like my ego has died. my current therapist told me that i might be suffering from depersonalization/derealization, which i agree with to some degree, but i feel like theres something more.another symptom which worries me is the fact that i often cant distinguish between what is **real** from what is not. sometimes i have **imaginary** arguments with people that i know, and despite the fact that i do realize theyre just in my head, my gut feeling keeps telling me that theyre really true and that everything is real. i can hold grudges on people who have done nothing wrong to me just because something in my head told me that these people have hurt me. for instance, one day i imagined that my mother tried to kill me and even though i knew it was just in my head, i still grew resentful toward her in real life (she never actually tried to hurt me).most of the time, i feel completely isolated. i dont have friends. i feel like i dont resonate with anyone. as a result, i often create realtionships in my head, and most of them are with **celebrities**. for the past few months, i have been having daily conversations with a deceased actor. everything he says or does, in my head, reflects what i feel towards my realtionship with him. i drink my coffee with him, i sleep with him, and every time i need to make an important decision, i ask for his opinion. its a platonic relationship, but i feel profound attachment towards him and all my life is being dictated by what ""he says"" in my head. some days i can completely hate him because i create weird scenarios in my head about how he killed someone or tried to murder me in my sleep, and then it takes a whole week or so until i reconcile with him. ive had such voices including people i did not personally know in the past too, but they werent so intense and disturbing as they are now...right now, i feel like my entire life is being controlled by this presence that i can feel but i cant see. and this presence is something thats permanently with me.&nbsp;overall, i just feel terribly isolated and unable to feel grounded. i feel like im living in my own imagination rather than in real life. i feel like im living in a simulation. sometimes im not hungry or thirsty or i refuse to sleep because my thoughts are acting up. i cant connect with reality at all: nothing is interesting or enjoyable anymore because i genuinely cant experience reality. nothig is actually **real** anymore, i can only experience my own version of reality, which is often distorted and weird and unenjoyable.&nbsp;i really need help. the mental health professionals in my area havent got a clue whats wrong with me. most of them have told me that ""im too young to be suffering from schizophrenia"" and that i seem pretty ""rational"" to them. but despite this, none were able to diagnose me and prescribe me the right treatment and i feel like, whatever i might be suffering from, its going to kill me soon. i cant take it anymore.what do you think about my situation? what should i do?

acyw7y,dear 2019,depression,"  dear 2018,after graduating, i decided that i wanted to go through higher education for my parents, despite me barely graduating high-school and not really wanting to do further studies. i was luckily accepted into a pretty good university in london that required higher grades than mine and had the chance to move in into my uncles apartment. i loved london, had a job, had a bursary, was into university. but i was not content with myself. i’ve never had a passion for something, further studies don’t necessarily interest me, and the only thing that i thrive for is to have a successful career. looking around me, i found passionate people that had goals, and that grinded hard to get through university. i expected to meet way more people, but have not had many opportunities to meet people, especially as i don’t drink alcohol and don’t have many points of interests. in 2018, i wanted to explore london and take more care of me. i had the chance to have friends come over twice and showing them the city felt so good. i discovered some of my favorite restaurants and had some of the best food in my life. i had my first solo travel experience outside of my usual family gatherings and went to amsterdam. spending the money was hard as it has always been an issue for me, but i loved wandering alone in the streets and trying random stuff.in 2018, i discovered i was depressive and bi-polar, just like my mother. this hurt me quite a lot, especially as i already have adhd and how it impacts me everyday. i had some of the biggest mood swings i’ve ever had in my life and had some very high moments and very low moments, which made me feel even worse overall. i found myself crying when i had no reason to do so and had no one to comfort me. i tried to be there for my friend’s mental health and discovered some of their issues. i did my best to comfort and it helped me so much to know that at least they had me to talk about those kinds of things.in 2018, i secured a year long internship with a very big company. being unhappy with the content of my degree, i was incredibly scared that i would not get a job without prior experience after graduation and stressed so hard getting a summer internship in 2017. i failed but used all of what i learned in 2018 and secured a placement very early on. the phone call might have been the best moment in my life. and whilst i failed at the last stage of recruitment of some very prestigious companies, that paid as much as 3 times of what my father has ever earned, i kept going and discovered that one of the only thing that i wanted in my life was achievable, especially as a kid that has lived his whole life in social housing, state schools, with a dad on minimum wage and a mother on disability.in 2018, i wanted to meet more people. i haven’t had the chance to meet a lot of people, and some people have either not entered my life or left it very quickly. it however never hurt me. in 2018, i wanted to die. letting that sink in was a hard task. i found myself, alone, in my room, wanting to die. and despite having sarcastically joked about it for shits and giggles, the process of becoming conscious that you want to die was life changing to me. i found myself bored, and alone, whilst being abroad with new responsibilities. &#x200b;dear 2019,i want to push myself further, do more sports, meet more people, but what i want the most is to get help. i am conscious of the implication of my mental health’s state but have always felt like i had self-control and that i didn’t need therapy. whilst i know that this is probably silly to anyone reading, i am just throwing this out here in hope that i could look back at this if i ever hit my goals.to a good 2019 to all of you, and hopefully me.",2019-01-06 00:08:08,someonesnewaccount,1

(psychosis, my illness had numb feelings in legs/hands)- feeling like my hands/body are ""light"" or uncoordinated. (psychosis)- feeling light-headed or like im about to faint. (psychosis, had similar feelings while tapering from benzos, but with less fear of ""something"" bad happening)- having some feelings of fear about my health, sometimes seemingly exaggerated. (psychosis, although ive had health anxiety for a while)- i wake up consistently 2-3 times every night with no other symptoms, and i fall back asleep. first sleep is always 3-4 hours. and i think its split in 3-4h windows. (effect due to increased benzos?)- i have odd hunger spells. i become hungry right after eating, even though im strictly eating healthy/low gi food. i stop feeling hungry after some time, but after eating im hungry again. (effect due to increased benzos?)- i have noticed i mix words in my mental monologue of the same group (e.g. fire/water, hands/feet). once mixed the first letters of two words. this isnt a problem to me, but it is a symptom.- there have been times where im feeling slightly happier than before, and theres this feeling that my mind is working well.most of the symptoms disappear in the mornings, then reappear in the evenings. theyre all very scary to me, and im afraid something else can go wrong until im properly medicated.psychiatrist visit is on the 16th. might ask to reschedule for an urgent visit on the 12th.until then, what the hell is wrong with me? theres nothing that seemingly influences how i feel. aggressive music doesnt make it worse, relaxation doesnt make it better.**just learned what psychosis means. im not experiencing psychosis. i just didnt have a better word for it. im on mobile, so i cant fix it.",2018-01-10 22:48:16,RektMyAnus,1

6qowt5,is this depression?,depression,"hello everyone,i struggle everyday with guilt and shame and its preventing me from acheiving my goals. i also have social anxiety.so here is how my average day goes:i wake up feeling great. then i will have a conversation with someone, and feel lik i made him uncomfortable because of my social anxiety (people notice). then this embarassing moment rolls in my head for an hour, and then my overall mood stays low all day long. even if i keep trying to focus on sport/reading/movies and also even after talking it out with a friend. i try to actively let it go, i try to reason it ""im human, dont be hard on yourself, just focus"", and i try to refuse thinking about it.honestly, nothing works.i think i have to change a lot about my thinking to improve it, but in the meantime, i am considering taking antidepressants so that it doesnt empiete on my daily routine.anyways i have 3 questions:1)if i generally feel good, if my mood is stable, as long as i dont feel guilty or ashamed, can i really call that a depression? it seems like i am only reacting to this one thing that i do. but it does ruin all of my days. 2) would antidepressants actually have a positive impact on that feeling of guilt or shame? i wonder if antidepressants are only going to have an overall mood enhancing effect, when what i want is to not feel so much inner pain everytime i make a tiny tini misake..3) do short term, fast acting antidepressants exist? i dont like taking daily meds, i d rather take a pill whenever i feel like i cant fight this shame/guilt feeling.",2017-07-31 17:53:47,Maxinprogress,1

6m0jza,on passion,depression,"[essentially posting this for myself as a journal entry. i know its long as hell.]im not feeling particularly low right now but im not feeling good or content either. if emotions are a wave then right now im in neither a crest nor a trough. my line looks pretty horizontal actually and i dont really know which direction will come next.there seem to be alot of posts recently about people wanting to find their passion. i totally understand this desire. however, it seems like they believe that it would make life easy to have one. (same thing with relationships but thats another story altogether...) my experience has been the opposite.i always knew what i wanted to do with my life. since i was about 10 or 11. its difficult to have discovered your passion so young (or at all, i believe). its funny how certainty can breed frustration in that way. everything else has changed entirely - even my very body and mind - except for that one thing.it can be comforting at times, for sure. sometimes when im surrounded by turmoil it can be nice to listen to the songs i loved when i was young. its effectively just like stepping in a time machine and travelling back there but without having to deal with all the painful parts of the past.im grateful for that indeed, but as i said, its hard having a constant thread in life. its exhausting and very often disappointing. being passionate about something (or some*one* for that matter) makes you really vulnerable to being hurt. im not just referring to criticism, be it internal or external... its like being naked and exposed in a way. its as if you have no way of covering up or protecting yourself because that would be to erase the fact that you are passionate. its kinda like the end of the trial - pink floyd. having a passion or enthusiasm for something is like the judge and the crowd yelling ""tear down the wall! tear down the wall!"" but all of it being completely silent and only inside your own head.now obviously this will sound like a complete exaggeration to most. im aware of that. i dont know if this is something unique to the modern world or if it always existed, but i feel like people who care alot about one thing are alienated. youre supposed to be well balanced in your interests and if not then youre just ""weird"". nobody likes to hear about one thing for any length of time or think about it deeply. after a certain point its ""enough now"" and onwards to the next thing. and i just get the impression that everyone is always skipping the track right before the really good part starts!but anyway, it doesnt really matter what others think or say. most passionate people are their own worst critics. even if you were in a room full of people praising you, it would still be possible to feel like a failure. fulfillment can only ever come from within and its a bloody difficult thing to achieve.i know that the only way to do that is to accept what you have and what you are. gratitude is also helpful, not just for the blessing but for the obstacles too. but why is it so hard to be supportive of and encouraging to myself? it comes so easily towards others, what makes me different?i know that thats a pretty standard experience in depressed people. i have made alot of progress in encouraging myself in other areas of life. however when it comes to my main interest i still struggle to feel adequate and worthy.i think one of the main reasons is that most people often put their younger selves down and dismiss who they used to be. theyre too afraid to empathise with their past selves. instead they call them naïve, immature or just plain stupid. but i dont do that. not anymore at least. i can laugh at my younger self, definitely! but i never belittle, insult or demean my past selves. theyre still a part of me after all. back then i did the best i could with what i knew at the time and i have to respect that.i feel really good when i notice something that would make my younger self feel proud. each time that i accomplish something that i only ever dreamed of doing before, it just fills my heart right up. :) thats why i trust the instincts i had as a kid. after all i did, amongst some other things, have fantastic taste in music for a 13 year old.if that little girl could meet me as i am now, i reckon shed think im pretty cool. that means alot to me. all the thoughts and feelings in my head right now would make no sense to her whatsoever. shed definitely love my tattoo as well. i definitely feel a sense of responsibility to make her proud because i had a really difficult, really shitty childhood. my depression also started when i was 13.so yeah, i guess i just have to try and remember this stuff. its hard but its important. everything happens in its own time and for a reason unbeknownst to us. whether im feeling up or down changes my perspective of things, but it doesnt change those things themselves.i will feel that sense of accomplishment and pride again. its guaranteed and i couldnt prevent it even if i tried. the work i do is as natural as breathing. sure, i hold my breath a little sometimes... but then it continues. ad infinitum.the other things in my life dont matter one bit - disrespectful people, excessive socialising, mistreatment by loved ones - none of that matters at all. the only thing that ever mattered to me and ever will is that i continue doing what i love most.",2017-07-08 14:45:54,hermitcait,1

acs52i,what are ways to feel happy after visiting family for a long time?,depression,"i don’t know if this is the right place to post, and i don’t think i necessarily have depression but, i just got home from phoenix, arizona and this basically happens every time i come from there. i have so much fun, surrounded by all my friends and family for a week or 2 twice a year. once i come home it hits me hard. i feel very sad and lonely. i don’t know if this happens to everyone but it does to me. i think it’s worst this time because we came home to a circuit being blown and destroyed from the outside plug on the side of the house (there was a bad storm before we got here). so i have no wifi to play games with my friends (which usually takes the thoughts off my mind and let’s me chill out a bit) and it really pissed me off, especially since now i have to wait for the circuit to be fixed tomorrow, and i’ll have only one day to be able to enjoy some games with friends and be able to play with my cousins on fortnite. i say i have only one day becuase after this weekend i start back school which makes me even more sad and pissed off at the same time. i fucking hate it where i live since i don’t know many people here who have the same interest as me and i’m not the most social person. i’m planning on moving to phoenix when i go to college to get out of this shithole city. it’s not all bad but i just don’t like the weather and atmosphere, and the other people that live here as well. sorry for the rant, my dad won’t understand what i’m talking about and i just need to get this stuff off of me and hopefully someone will reply to this lol. it’s like whenever i go out of town i change sort of. once i come home i realize how boring my damn life is and i don’t really notice it because i am so used to it. i think all i need is some more friends and people that take more interest in my hobbies. i need to be more social. i guess i’ll just go to bed soon and hope that tomorrow will be a lot better. i just miss my family and being able to talk to a lot of people back there.

8na9wq,i'm sick of hearing about people talking up exercise/being outside as a cure.,depression,"when i exercise too hard, it saps my bodys energy. it makes me feel sweaty and gross. it makes my muscles sore. that physical pain and weakness are not great for my mental health. it stresses me out when i feel like i cant breathe like i did yesterday when i walked about 8,000 steps in very high heat and high humidity. i dont get where the magical depression cure is in pushing myself through a blanket of water droplets for over an hour. im pretty sensitive to heat being so fair-skinned, so i scoff obviously whenever memes or the internet generally seems to act like ""going outside"" is a cure. i feel better when im inside and in a temperature-controlled shelter. does that make me weak or a bad person? maybe some people beat their depressions or blues by going outside and sweating it out. but i just feel fucking drained and suicidal after most intense sessions. a little walk on a nice day is fine. but also, its tied to pill-shaming. in that, people who shame others for their use of anti-depressants act like the obvious replacement for them is some combination of sunlight, exercise, healthy eating, adequate sleep, and socializing. and while all those things are obviously important, they are not anti-depressants. stop acting like you know more about brain chemistry than a neuroscientist or psychiatrist. kthanx. also this article agrees with me: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/exercise-isnt-a-cure-all-for-mental-health-problems-for-me-it-led-to-self-destruction-a6895106.html ",2018-05-30 20:05:45,rachaellefler,0

4tpd4k,"it does not necessarily ""get better"".",depression,"in 2002-3 i was suicidal as a junior high student. classes were getting hard, i had no niche at school (2 friends but no clique), everyone bullied me, and my mother was poor. everything felt like a struggle and a waste of time. i didnt want to live, and felt like suicide on a regular basis, especially when i got into fights or trouble. now its 2016, so its been 14 years, and i did not manage to become as successful as an adult as i would have hoped. im still living with my mom, who works as a substitute teacher, and i babysit my little sisters and take online classes toward a degree in something i like (art history) but that has small career prospects. life is difficult for us to say the least. i keep sinking into debt more and more each year. affording to live is hard. i dont know what i would have told my past self about suicide. my life didnt get better just because i gave up suicidal thoughts and cutting myself. i still have a hard time dealing with all the problems. and back then i thought 9/11 was the worst thing that could happen and since then there have been a whole slew of mass killings and terror attacks. i still am poor and it still sucks. no one socially likes you if youre poor because you cant buy them things or take them out. im trying to get out of poverty but i cant stop thinking that, if it did not get any better for me significantly between 2002 and 2016, can i trust that it will in the next 14 years? or will i just accumulate more debt, get sicker and fatter, get a job i hate, have slightly more money but never as much as i hope? its necessary to believe that life gets better but many times it just doesnt, so i think telling depressed young people ""it gets better"" is dishonest. its certainly not certain to get better.",2016-07-20 07:10:08,rachaellefler,1

acoivz,"had a bad anxiety attack, and decided to write about it to make me feel better.",depression,"i hate the month of january. the high you get from the happiness of the holiday season wears off, and you’re forced to deal with the harsh realities that the new year brings. i don’t make “new year’s resolutions” or try to make every new year the “best year of my life”. the best year of my life will happen when it is meant to happen. i am not going to try to force unrealistic expectations into my year - i know i will only be setting myself up for disappointment. why do we hold on to unrealistic expectations if we know they’ll only lead us into the inevitable pit of despair we call reality? for some people, unrealistic expectations are the only reason we get out of bed in the morning. life is pure shit, but we keep a firm grasp onto this idea, this hope, that one day, you’ll will wake up, and life will be dramatically different. life will be fun and worth living and you won’t spend every waking moment anxious about the future. but after so many rejected internship applications, after so many failed auditions, after so many flunked exams, after so many months of trying to lose that body fat but maintaining the same dreadful weight, after being ghosted by so many people that you poured your heart out too, after another failed attempt at a meaningful relationship with another human being, you lose your grip. many of us have unrealistic expectations when we first meet someone, especially if that certain someone is attractive. in our head, we imagine ourselves falling in love with them, having a meaningful relationship, getting married and having children. but more often than not, we never see this person again, or never talk to them again, or if we do, they end up no being the person we expected them to be. this is why i try to proceed with extreme caution when someone shows interest in me. but more often than not, i fall, and i fall hard - and the unrealistic expectations take over. why? because i want to feel something, and feel loved-everyone wants to feel loved. it is a feeling like no other. but who am i to talk about feelings-when i am devoid of any type of feeling 93% of the time. i let this person into my life, which, of course, leads to the inevitable act of intercourse. and then-just as quickly as it happened-they leave. and these unrealistic expectations fade into oblivion. i feel like a fool for believing he would ever want anything more than my body. then, a few months later, someone new comes around, and the toxic cycle begins again.unrealistic expectations can be used to escape our own mundane lives, or avoid feelings. the feeling of loneliness is arguably one of the worst feelings in the world. the feeling that no one cares. time and time again family members or friends tell you that they “will always be there for you” or “will always be there to support you through your darkest times”. but during your darkest times, the times when you feel the most alone, they always seem to prove themselves wrong.why am i being so pessimistic? why am i being so dark? i’m always told if i was more “optimistic” i would be happier. fucking bullshit. maybe it is because i was born with a chemical imbalance in my brain, or maybe i have been fucked over one too many times by the wrong person-but i can’t afford to be optimistic. i can’t afford to have unrealistic expectations or goals. when i’m asked “what’s wrong” and i attempt to put my feelings into words, i am told “life could be worse”. shit, i know my life could be worse. i could be living outside in an oversized cardboard amazon box for fuck’s sake. being told “life could be worse”, when my feelings that i try so hard to put into words are invalidated, it only makes me feel worse. and you wonder why i push people away.late december and early january are, arguably, the worst times to browse social media. (granted, any day or time of the week is a bad time to be on social media. it is nothing more than a facade of who we think we are. who we want others to believe we truly are. but that is a whole other conversation in itself.) people share photos from their “amazing” year-photos from a frat party on halloweekend, bikini shots from their march break in bermuda, and tranquil landscape photos from their study abroad trip in england. (i swear, people spend a few months in a european country and it becomes apart of their personality. i mean, i’m like that too, except my personality stems from my long weekend in a psych ward in 2016). why isn’t my life like that? why are people living the life i should be living? since elementary school, i had this expectation of how my life would be-attending a college in california, where i would make tons of friends, maybe go on a study abroad trip, find myself a boyfriend, get a career out of college, get married, live happily ever after. that’s how life seems to be going for a lot of people i know. but not me. my life has been far from that. anyway, here’s to a new year, and all the fuckery that will inevitably come with it.

9pwi8b,interesting tidbit i read about hyper-arousal vs. hypo-arousal in ptsd. thoughts?,mentalhealth,"""hyper and hypo arousal in ptsdthe common conception of ptsd from movies, magazine stories, and other social media is that it involves forms of hyperarousal such as memory intrusions, flashbacks, hypervigilant scanning for reminders of the trauma, excessive startle response, irritability, violent rage, and insomnia due to nightmares, anxiety or agitation. hyperarousal is tied to living in or intermittently diving back into what boon, steele, and van der hart (2011) call “trauma time” in their book coping with trauma-related dissociation. in truth major traumatization gives rise to symptoms of hyperarousal and hypoarousal (boon, steele, & van der hart, 2011). hypoarousal is characteristic of dissociative disorders and ptsd. hypoarousal is associated with the freeze response in mammal mediated by the dorsal vagus nerve when they face a threat to life which they cannot avoid by fighting or fleeing. hypoarousal is manifested by features like amnesia, emotional and/or physical numbing, depersonalization (feeling estranged from oneself), and derealization (feeling as if the environment is unreal or dreamlike). hypoarousal makes it difficult or even impossible to experience feelings of love, pleasure or interest. hypoarousal exists in major depression as the wet blanket that makes the sufferer indifferent to love, friendship, and opportunities for play, amusement or entertainment. however the diagnosis of depression emphasizes the presence of great sadness, dark mood, recurrent thoughts of death, and so on, while the diagnosis of ptsd does not. ptsd is more a disorder of memory, physiology, and interpersonal behavior while depression is primarily a disorder of mood that influences cognition and functions like eating, sleeping, sexual activity, and movement. the neurophysiological key to understanding ptsd is that one and the same sufferer will show hyperarousal when living in or reminded of trauma time and hypoarousal (freeze) as a means of avoiding a return to the trauma memories that feel as if they are happening now. hyperarousal and hypoarousal are both unconscious, protective responses to trauma that lie at opposite poles of the ptsd continuum. just as a person with bipolar i disorder can shift back and forth from mania to depression a person with ptsd can switch back and forth between hyper and hypo arousal.""has anyone noticed that there is often a lot more focus placed on hyperarousal than hypoarousal?",2018-10-20 21:30:44,Nummoth,1

i ended up texting you and i ended up seeing your profile picture and your whatsapp status. i started running around in the room like crazy, i told myself to calm down but it didnt work. and then when i said im in a lot of pain because of you and you said dont put it on me. fair enough. and then you blocked me when i asked you to talk to me. fair enough. then why did you ask me how i was in the first fucking place? did you really care about me? then why did you say that i cant talk because im sleepy? i am not mad at you for breaking up. that brings sadness which i will talk about in due time. but i hate your fucking excuses. im in a bus. im eating. im pooping. well, you know what? im fucking dying. i get to be tended first. you can miss an hour of sleep for someone who helped you so much in life. and this is not even after break-up. why? like why? have i ever shouted at you? why avoid confrontation? we dated for three years, you owe me answers n. its a complete dick move to disappear over a text message. its cowardly. and im crying here, missing food, missing sleep. i had to tell you all these things but you still didnt call me, when we were dating? now of course you dont owe me anything. go and be happy. you had your flaws and i dont think i can forgive you. but go and be happy. i dont need a phone call. i dont need you to break up with me on phone or in person. i dont think you have the courage to do that. i hope you gather than courage. because i dont like it when people use you and manipulate you. i know your past was brutal and because of that, you lack that courage of proper intervention. but i hope you move on. nobody will shout at you for being yourself.now let me talk about my anxiety. im extremely hurt. im worried i will never fall in love again. im worried that im too ugly. my anxiety is skyrocketing. i dont know what to do because i really feel scared about the future reddit. you can look at my post history and see how many times i have posted this very same thing. im very afraid about my future. its so uncertain. love looks tricky and i dont know if i can find it. there is nothing wrong with me as such. i am well read. i am a musician. i have a lot of depth in both philosophy and psychology. i have the most beautiful friends in the world who stayed up all night to help me. i dont think i am unlovable because i have so much love and it keeps increasing the more i give. i can give a lot of love. but im worried about the statistics. is it too late for me? im 27 and im an indian. so that means, that i have 2-3 years to find love before i enter the arranged marriage. nothing wrong with that also. im pretty sure i can find someone like you there. but i want better. im not sure if i will get it however. can i find love in 3 years? well, if i find it in america then that would mean i stay in america forever. that would suck because i dont like it here that much. great country but i feel socially isolated. and dating in india is extremely difficult. so that just leaves arranged marriage and 2-3 years before that. can i find love in 2-3 years? i have never had a year where i didnt go on dates before you. i have never had difficulty making female friends. most of my friends are girls. my success ratio was very good in india. but are there any single people in india who would like to settle down in 2-3 years? i dont know. probably not. and thats why i am anxious. that anxiety is scaring me away and all this mental gymnastic is turning into one sentence ""i will never find love again"". based on what? on fucking nothing. on the odds. but last case, an arranged marriage. if we include all the odds then i think there would be a very high probability for me to not be alone. but will i find love? again, i dont fucking know and i am getting really scared. im super jealous of you that you found love. im jealous because it feels like someone took all my self-esteem and happiness and gave it to your current boyfriend. im jealous because i feel like he is the better person. if i saw him in real life, im positive that i will fuck him up. at least by words. but i feel jealous of him. i feel like your boyfriend is perfect and im not. and that jealousy is so bad that i cannot even close my eyes. i close my eyes and see you asking him whats up sitting on a stone together with him. i close my eyes and i see a faceless man holding your hand in your college garden. and i feel jealous. lastly, i feel sad. i really loved you n. i wanted to marry you in a year. it was just bad timing and you also know that i dont hate you. i genuinely want you to be happy. im not in my senses and i know i have said a lot more than i should have. but i wanted to destroy all hopes. i tried so hard to say fuck you to you. but i couldnt bring myself to say it. but fuck you. you are the best person i have been with but fuck you for leaving me without a call. and i feel sad because i dont know what future has. there is an alternate life story where i marry you and we talk and we love. and i will never get to live that timeline and that makes me sad. we will never ever talk and that makes me super sad you know. ill miss you n. ill miss you. you gave me some of the best moments till now, in my life. and ill always love you for giving me back the love. fuck you for taking it away. go now. goodbye.

8hblls,i need some re-assurance. i feel like i will never find someone who will love me.,offmychest,"im a 27 year old indian male who grew up in india. i was in a long distance relationship with someone but she told me yesterday that she has moved on and is in love with someone else.not only am i very hurt, because i genuinely did my best to save the relationship and i also lost a very kind caring and understanding person but i feel like ill never ever find someone else and im burning inside with jealousy that she is now gone to someone else. and i also feel that ill be alone for the rest of my life.my only option is to go back to india at this stage and try to find someone there. i dont think ill ever find a date. im 27 and i am losing my hair from the crown and im not attractive at all. i am a nice person and i genuinely wanted to marry and spend the rest of my life with this person. ive been in two serious relationships and they all took away a part of me. and i think that this is the dead end for me. nobody will ever look beyond my looks. ill never be able to get a match on tinder and i dont know where and how else will i ever find love. the other option is an arranged marriage. i think i wont find someone who understands me there also. i will have to quit weed. my ex let me be myself. i will never be able to tell the person in an arranged marriage of all the scars that have marred me. i will lose my power of choice in meeting someone.im heading for a disaster and i think its statistically very likely that i will end up alone. ill never get to experience human affection. i will never get to experience unconditional love, never have an understanding with someone. nobody will ever love me and even if they do love me, they wont love me the way i am. they will love a version of me who has to hide himself because nobody will ever like the real genuine me.im literally dying of anxiety. then the feelings of my ex being with someone else just breaks me. i know there is no hope and im positive that there is no point. its over. but life looks so dreary right now. if it was not for some of my friends and some people who genuinely care about me, make sure that i eat, that i feel loved, that i feel validated say that this will get better and that i will definitely find love. but i find it impossible to believe. i lost someone who was very understanding. it was not completely my fault but i made plenty of mistakes. she did too.i dont know what im talking about. i feel very very crushed. my friends keep telling me that you are just low on self-esteem and its possible that i will find love. but im so ugly and i smoke weed that i dont know if anybody will ever like me.",2018-05-06 03:24:23,kartokovitz,1
8gtfbf,i just wanna talk about life,offmychest,"i dont know whether to laugh or cry. i have anxiety and i struggle with depression and substance abuse. when im not high, im constantly hating on myself. constantly running calculations in my head. my brain just runs faster than usual. i cry, i try to watch porn to distract myself. but then i get high and everything goes away. it feels like relief, beauty, calm and a complete understanding of the world is just a step away. so i get high. my life perpetually fluctuates between the two and im not ashamed of myself or depressed about it. its just that i broke up with someone i wanted to be with but i was hesitant because of anxiety and depression. and now im using marijuana as a coping mechanism. trust me, i do work out. i do have a routine. im active but im very alone except my books. im afraid of anything new. im the sort of person who is comfortable losing ground slowly everyday. i get up and i fall down and i have been doing that for a long time. i guess that is what rest of the humans do as well. its just that my intensity is so so loud and sonorous. everyday i face trouble falling asleep and as if that was not enough, i get up with a sort of panic attack. i really want to kill myself over not saying ""thank you"" to my barista.im from india and i was dating someone really nice and i couldnt really take the right decision. ironically, i just wanted to have sex with someone white and im afraid of being caught soliciting these things. so for three years, i kept trying and then i told her one day that that is the only reason i am in america and she was hurt but she laughed at the same time too. and now she is dating someone else. which is okay, good for her. but im alone and i looked up the entire arranged marriage tradition. someone asked me on a date but as a filter they asked me my educational background and my family background. i noped the fuck out of it. so here i stand. i have no interest in things which the world has to offer to me. i honestly have a lot of passion in me for music, for books, for poetry, for meditation. im genuinely dedicated to figuring this shit out and im honestly ahead of a lot of people, thanks, in part, to therapy.but i have no real human connections. and i feel like its either weed or things like a genuine human connection. i mean, where have i come, with all the philosophy and psychology and self-improvement. yes, i meditated a lot. yes, i improved myself. i still have issues, that is true. but i understand myself well enough to say that its funny and depressing at the same time. life makes no sense. success, money, status make no sense. they have no correlation, at least for me, to happiness. i dont even mind being sad to be honest. but it looks like this is it. the only thing that i feel like adds some meaning to my life is love really. sure my job can add meaning, gym can add meaning, writers like virgina woolf can add meaning and ill keep them all with me. but essentially, im happiest when im in love. but what really is love given my condition? arranged marriage or tinder. so lets talk about an arranged marriage. i have to tell my family background to the family of the girl before i get to see her. and i live in seattle. it should be safe for me to not disclose these details and still be a nice person. because my family is composed of simple village-dwelling people. my parents are the sweetest people in the world but they are not successful, they dont have any accolades to show off. they still say that me and my brother are their biggest achievements, i mean the kind of people we have grown up as. they wont qualify any screening test and so wont i. now lets talk about tinder or neo-dating. im brown, im fit but im not athletic. im decent looking but im no rockstar. i write nice messages to everyone on okcupid. i do feel frustrated at times but i still am not rude to anybody for their choice of not liking me. i get it. but where does that put me? three years. not a single good friend. and its getting worse. i have lost my energy to want to impress people. and neither do i expect this from someone. i know im not a 10. i usually dont message anybody out of my league. the only people i dont message are people who i am not attracted to at all. and i guess the people who reject me are coming from a similar position. but it essentially creates capitalism out of dating. i dont want sex. i dont want anything hot. or a person who hikes. i just someone who likes me. and i would genuinely try to make it work. i wont reject someone because they dont have a wanderlust or if they are a recovering alcoholic. do other people see dating in this way? in my experience, a lot of us dont.i meditated. i wrote my journals. i read amazing books. i watched amazing shows and movies. i learnt to make music. i learnt to appreciate all kinds of music. i became well versed in philosophy. i am on my journey to become fairly well versed in psychology. i got healthy and i ran for miles. people say that im intelligent and creative. but at the same time, i got a pornhub premium subscription. i have smoked weed almost everyday for the past two years. my career makes no sense. i developed a bit of an eating disorder. i broke up with my best friend and my girlfriend. i want to go back to india but where exactly? thats a shitty feeling you know. the home no longer exists. when people tell me that im intelligent and creative, i think they are just saying it. they dont mean it. i see that the problem here is with self-esteem. i see all my problems very clearly. i still cant fix them. my hands go automatically to weed, then to my penis and then to pornhub. i constantly lie to myself and also to others. thats the depressing part about it all. its a wall and i really really really wanna climb that wall, it will give me a lot of meaning. but i dont know how. i know everything about the wall, the color, the dimension, the material. but it seems like i dont have hands. i cant fucking climb the wall. so i take the door. but im too big for the door. i cant fit in. i have too much of a baggage to carry. so i turn back to my safe place. my home. but thats not there either. confused, i run from this corner to that corner and then i see weed. i smoke weed and the desolate desert of my existence turns into a plush booming oasis. but it soon goes away, the cold breeze of the oasis soon turns warm. and i find myself staring at the door again.so do i cry or do i laugh. im doing both at the moment. in my opinion, theres a very thin line between emotions. i also know that very few people will read this gigantic wall of text. its all good. no new information has been added to the system.

8baxli,the lecture on addiction made me pity myself,offmychest,"i was trying to understand my own addiction and marijuana abuse and why i cant quit. and also, why when i go back home in india, i dont want to smoke that much. i watched a few lectures on addiction and the genes which are susceptible to addiction and the most common sign for someone who will suffer from this sort of compulsive abuse is not their compulsion to score a hit but a compulsion to make the displeasure go away. the medical term for this sort of displeasure is ""dysphoria"", sort of the opposite of euphoria. and then i heard the stories of addicts and almost everyone feels socially vulnerable. they always feel as if they dont belong. it could be because of trauma but it doesnt matter how it is caused. you can look at my comment history and you can see how much i suffer from being judged all the time, from thinking that i am a bad person because people keep ghosting me, or feeling that im boring because i talk about my own set of interests and how i feel and i dont talk much about sports or bitcoin or other things. going through the lecture on dysphoria was like reading my own self. my mom was overly protective of me so i had literally no friends till i was 18. when i went to college, i finally found love and then she broke up with me. so,  as any sane person would, i tried to kill myself. i survived but then nobody wanted to talk to me. everywhere i go people would pick on me, they would call me crazy. some guy even accused me for stealing his laptop. i was so fucking glad that college was over.but then the same thing happened with my job. i made few good friends, started dating someone, she broke up. this time i didnt try to kill myself because i had some friends. but most of them moved on to different places and again i was stuck with people who did not understand me. they would say something about my miserable self-esteem and think it was a joke but i would be hurt so deep that i would seek refuge in weed. i came to america running away from this ghost that has chased me all my life. this sense of not belonging, not being comfortable in my own skin, always giving more and being returned less. some people did however give me as much as i gave and i have a few friends back home that i cherish every single day. so it was not all bad.and now in america, its been three years. i have no friends, i have no relationships. i used to go out with someone in india but she hasnt even replied back to my texts in more than two months. i dont think she wants to go out with me. thats fine, its her life and she is free to live it the way she wants. but im hurt, i feel different from others. i feel like nobody understands me and i feel like im all alone, by myself in this world. it might sound like i am blowing things out of proportion but im speaking emotionally here rather than analytically. i have parents and friends but they are across the atlantic and given my circumstances, i just cant go back. shit has not hit the roof yet so i guess ill persevere.i will try to do my best with this opportunity and this life still is a blessing. i just dont know how to solve this problem. its true that all my relationships in america are superficial but its also true for a significant chunk of americans i know. perhaps they are comfortable with this lifestyle but to me it looks dehumanizing. how am i supposed to write a profile on how awesome i am on okcupid? that by definition betrays the sort of humility and the idea of knowing someone i believe in? commodification of any human value, be it love, health, justice, might sound great from a utilitarian point of view but its actually self-effacing.i am not mad at anyone. i just think that its a very difficult problem to get over and partly me and partly society is to blame. im going to marijuana anonymous in the evening today and im getting a cat tomorrow to have a companion i can nurture. lets see if this works.thanks for listening",2018-04-10 23:12:05,kartokovitz,1
87pb2k,i feel judged all the time.,offmychest,"i was having some relationship issues so i chose not to go to work but i mentioned in my message to work ""i am going to be out for something really urgent. i apologize for the short notice. ill be back online in the evening for email errands"". and i feel so judged for saying that. i feel like my manager will think that im lame and also a pretentious liar. i feel like hell think that im incompetent and i feel so wrong about this incident, about being judged by my manager that i really feel a cringe and want to run away and never show my face to anyone, especially him, my manager. i feel like i should just disappear for having lied so blatantly to him. of course everybody can tell and now they think of me as a liar, a loser and probably someone worth every single ounce of scorn, hatred and mockery. i tried to reason with myself that this is probably just my anxiety or me making things worse or overly catastrophic but it seems to come back again and again and every time i recall them and their reaction in my head, i feel like im the stupidest liar in the whole universe and probably the most unprofessional, dishonest piece of shit. i feel like now they have busted me and figured out who i truly am and now they just think that im faking it. now the only question is how much they can tolerate me. i actually feel like i am faking it, ive never really worked hard but i have been performing well. at the core of this incident is my repeating anxiety and self-esteem issues. i just seem to think that i am a piece of shit and im hyper vigilant of the signs that me feel that way. this is not the first time that ive beaten myself over something like this. i remember feeling the same way about my coworker. i just dont like lying, that is true. but i didnt have an option here. i could have said that i feel sick but i sort of panicked and ended up saying something really stupid. i also tend to be very dutiful. i am ambitious, i like working hard. but i dont have a duty towards my corporation. at the very least, my duty with my gf comes before my work and if i was upset about my relationship, possibly a break-up, how could i have kept my cool and went off to work. to provide for one duty, one bond, one relationship i trust and enjoy and relish so much, i had to take from one relationship, which i feel completely dehumanized in. how could i have ever made any different of a choice. sure, i lied and even ended up making me sound very stupid. but i did it out of confusion between two duties and over-estimating the size of my official duties and commitments. secondly, i feel like not having a support group around me makes me bottle up all my love and a lot of my self-worth and it leads to utter confusion, not only in acting rationally and confidently but also estimating the damage for making a bad choice, like this casual leave today. and the harder anybody is to please, the more judged i feel by them. the more i feel like my imposter cover has been blown. and i tend to keep going through events about instances where i let my cover blow. im hyper-vigilant of signs in their behavior and most importantly my behavior around them. and i only focus on such incidents, not the whole picture. and this leads to a very crippling sense of dependence on others. i always want these people to like me. and these people are not there to like me, they are there to do their own thing. so, devoid of any validation from these people, i look for signs why they do not give me any validation. of course i think that its because they know what kind of a piece of shit i am. in my opinion the sense of sense ought to be based on the best version of ourselves instead of the worst version of ourselves. we all lie, cheat, make irrational mistakes, say stupid things. but you know what, for the most part, most people are fine people. they are just trying to navigate their own lives in this world, which at times is just miserable. i dont judge others so much, i frequently give anybody any kind of help and empathy i can. i think this should extend to me too. thats not only how i view others but thats how i view humans and human morality too. yes, psychologically speaking, stress, anxiety etc. makes us do silly things. but the part of us that passes on the judgement on the irrationality of our actions is just not the same person. theres no point judging that part because its almost as if there was no free will or partial free will involved. countless times, the same patterns and behaviors have popped up in the same order. but when i judge these incidents, i judge them from a dualist point of view where i had full control and full free will to act. but i didnt. there have however been a lot of incidents where i have gone against my instincts and use my rationality and my empathy to do things. those are the incidents i ought to judge myself because thats the

87jbrh,i don't have anybody close to me to share this with me so please read it,offmychest,"i took a one month vacation and went back to see my parents, girlfriend, friends etc. i was doing really well in life. i barely felt depression, i was exercising regularly, meditating, eating well. my therapist told me that hes honestly in awe with the amount of progress ive made in the month i was away. my girlfriend stopped talking to me the moment i flew back from her. for a almost a month she kept saying that shes depressed. so i gave her space. when she tried to talk to me in the night, i said you can rather sleep because youre not feeling well. now i was worried what is up with her. she would see my message and not reply back and i distinctly remember that i couldnt sleep two nights because of all this. i was finally kicking depressions ass. and ive been fucking depressed forever. self-harm, hygine, i check every single box when it comes to depression. but i was kicking it. for the first time in my life. i wanted to go back to school, i wanted to do so much more. but now my gf, to whom i was supposed to marry next year says she doesnt see me as a relationship.it hurts but it hurts in so many different ways. im afraid that i live in an area where statistically speaking, the odds are not in my favor. and even if the odds were just fine, i dont really like dating. i like being in a relationship with someone built around trust, validation and love. and im 27 already and i dont know if its too late because i get depressed fairly easily when theres nobody to comfort me. and it feels as if this will be the start of another long and painful episode of depression and ill lose another year of my life and along with it, health, hair, energy and sense of happiness.i really liked her. i really liked the kind of person she had been and the kind of personal she makes me feel like. i feel so much better around her and not in a validating way either. depression, support groups and other forms of self-improvement has made me very self-aware of human behavior and biases. so honestly, she could not validate me because she was just not up for the jedi mind tricks and rhetorics i was pulling out. but i genuinely enjoyed helping her out. i helped her with her educational finances because i really didnt want her to give up on her dream. and now hearing from her life is too short for compromises with a smiley face in the end just makes me super mad. life is indeed about compromises. its about the kind of compromises you can live with. something that might be compromising in one way but rewarding in the other. and it makes me mad that she feels this way. im not going to correct her, im not mad at her at breaking up with me. she is her own person and good for her. i just care too much about her and she and i both have nurtured both of us, and how we view relationships and trust. and to see her take such a u-turn makes me feel really sad. the depression makes it all the worse because after having such a (at least in my opinion) virtuous relationship, i dont want to go back to dating. i dont want to date. but i need a support group outside friends. and it will be such hard work and struggle to do it all over again. i was just happy it was all in the past and i could focus my efforts on helping others, like my alcoholic brother or my aging parents. perhaps i should do that. i would still, at the very least, really like someone to listen to me. i know im probably just rambling because i have written this entire thing in one go. but this made me feel so much better. and strangely, some head-nods will give me validation, empathy and forgiveness towards my own and herself.thank you.",2018-03-27 17:31:11,kartokovitz,1

6s1b2v,playing guitar has changed my life.,offmychest,"i learnt how to play guitar last october. it was a slow start but i kept playing as a form of escapism. i tried quitting weed. i tried going to gym. i tried making friends. i tried not to get a validation from people online. along with all this struggle, i kept playing. a couple of days back, i played in front of my friend and he said im pretty good at it. it was the first time i played for someone so that was a pleasant surprise. i used to think that im shit. then i was home alone a last tuesday and i got high and kept playing. but this time i focussed on my best and ended up recording myself. i was completely amazed at hearing the recording. i was actually good. not in a cocky way but if anybody played like that id be impressed. the feeling of being good started snowballing. i recorded myself and listened back. it was better than before. and very soon i realized that i could play the same things easily now. more people appreciated my playing. someone even jammed with me today. i felt more confident in myself.the learning curve was crossed. ill hit another learning curve soon but i can play rhythm from pink floyds time. and i have been playing for 8-10 hours since that day. i know that its still a form of escapism but i dont hate myself so much. everyday someone comes up to me and says ""that was awesome"" or ""that was great"". and it raises my self-esteem to a whole new level. i played for my mom and she said ""im proud of you"".it felt great. im no longer mad at myself. good job me. you worked hard.

7tp2gl,i recovered.,depression,"excuse me if i write like a 12 years old. not a native english speaker. i just want to put it out there. for people who dont know if its really your own thoughts or if its depression makes you feel like this and suffer like this. heres what i think and went through: im lucky enough to recover from my depression now. i was depressed for more than a year. i didnt know it was a sickness. i thought all those negative thoughts come from me. because how could it not be? the pain, the self doubts, the self loathing, the anxiety, all those suffering was so real and painful. i remember i cried every night(in day time too) and used up so many tissue paper for more than a year. i stopped eating for a few months because my stomach felt weird and doctor couldnt find out why physically. i dropped a whole 15kg in that time. i consistently went to therapist and doctor every week and at some point tried to kill myself. my friends had to call the cops on me. sometimes i think back and think to myself if i was really depressed or was i just too stubborn to let things go? nope. thats definitely a sickness. because i cant cry my eyeballs out every night for that long even if i want to now. i dont want to die now. i still struggle to get out of bed but thats because my beds too comfy. i look forward to the next day now. i still struggle from some social problems but who doesnt. point is: no one wants to be sad and miserable all the time. its not something you would want or fake to ""get attention"" or ""play the victim"". its pure pain and suffering. you telling someone how you feel is not whining, its you gathering whatever strength you have left in your body and trying to get help. i never want to go back to that stage again. and i do not wish to see any of you suffer. i wish i could help but im not a psychiatrist or therapist. i just wish that you can get those help and talk to them. the only help i can offer is what i tried to do: try to get comfy when youre feeling sad. its hard to feel that bed when youre really comfy in bed. hug the teddy bear that you had from your childhood or just get a soft toy, any animal or robot or anything of your own choice. wrap in a blanket and hug them when youre sad and want to cry. watch some funny videos in youtube. dont get out of bed if you really dont want to but instead really take your meds on time. clean your room. a clean room really helps. stop smiling if you dont want to. talk more in here if youre not comfortable talking to your friends and family anymore. we all have or had depression here so we somehow understand what youre going through. i really hope you guys can get through it.

ack5xc,"serious advice: avoid melancholic music, make an empowering/uplifting playlist and blast it on repeat. it might save your life. (backstory inside)",depression,"some backstory. a woman id been in a relationship with for more than 6 years broke up with me. i was very much still in love with her (and still am), and no matter what i tried i wasnt able to get over her. i spiraled into increasingly deep depression and insomnia, and frequently considered taking my life.on a phone call with my parents a month ago i divulged that id been feeling ""a little down recently,"" which theyd noticed themselves based on my tone of voice, but i avoided telling them the extent to which i was is danger. my moms heart is in the right place but knowing that id been considering ending my life for the past two months would cause her stress and worry, and i didnt want to inflict that on her. my dad, on the other hand, was the directer of a psychiatric hospital for more than 30 years, so hes dealt with countless depressed clients, and even though i downplayed my situation to them on the phone he seemed to pick-up on the situation better than my mom.while i was home for christmas/new years, i offhandedly mentioned to my dad that id been listening to a lot of damien rice recently. my dad enthusiastically took an interest and we listened to a bunch of damien rice songs together. eventually, he noted that a lot of rices songs have a very melancholic tone to them, and told me about the patients hed had over the years who, while dealing with depression, intuitively thought that listening to music that matched their depressed mood made them feel better. we had a great conversation about mental health research that points to the opposite result, that people who are already clinically depressed feel worse while/after listening to music that matches their mood, and that the exact opposite has been found if they instead listen to uplifting music.the conversation prompted some reflection from me and i realized 1) it suddenly seemed obvious to me that listening to depressing music while depressed would make the depression worse, not better, and 2) id intuitively been drawn to listening to a lot of depressing music over the past two months.the next day i started building a spotify playlist of songs that are uplifting/empowering. some are takes on relationship breakups but from a more positive, self-empowering angle (kelly clarkson: stronger, since u been gone; little mix: shout out to my ex; ariana grande: thank u, next; christina aguilera: fighter; lizzo: good as hell)some are just songs that i find to be happy confidence boosters (sara bareilles: brave; macklemore & ryan luis: cant hold us; daya: sit still, look pretty; katy perry: roar)meanwhile ive actively avoided listening to any morose songs that would let me wallow in my depression and obsess on the loved one that i lost, and its honestly amazing what a difference its made. is my depression ""cured""? hell no, thats an ongoing struggle, but since i made this change i seriously have been feeling like im on an upward trajectory for the first time in a very long time. yesterday i put my playlist on shuffle and danced alone in my room for half an hour, and it felt great.if anyone has their own songs that help keep them in better spirits add a comment, im still looking for new songs to add to my playlist. and if anyone just needs a friendly exchange, feel free to comment for support.",2019-01-04 19:06:54,IAmTheJudasTree,0

acgwuk,i think i'm actually giving up.,depression,"all my life has been a series of loved ones going away for no reason, my family ignoring me to the point i could starve myself for a whole week and nobody noticed it, i never had a group of friends at all and i found myself wandering between other groups without really belonging to one.my boyfriend doesnt understand why, and yesterday evening i think i finally understood.i think that im not one of those persons that can have friends or good relationship or anything. all i had was nothing, and me trying over and over again just got me with way more trauma than anyone i know and a general knowledge that eventually everyone goes away and nobody actually cares that much about my well-being.its like im a piece of a puzzle that was put into an entirely different picture: sure, i can fit in, but i will always be the one that stands out because i am me. i tried being someone else and that didnt work, i tried to be me and it got even worse than before, so at this point it has to be it, right?me being me means me being alone, and even though the thought of going back to an empty home makes me desperate i dont think ill ever have anything different than that.so i guess thats it. im either too much or not enough for everybody, so whats the point in trying? ill only have weak relationships and friendship that stand on me being funny sometimes, nothing more.i dont even feel lonely, i just feel like theres no place on this earth for me, and there never will be. i feel like a guest in my own family, everyone around me just looks at me and gives me those fucking stupid pre-made answers like ""im so sorry for you"" or ""you got this"".truth is, i cant deal with this anymore. the more i go on, the more depressed i get. it feels like fighting against a shadow, trying to kill fog, and i just cant. i dont want to waste the few energy i have on trying to built something that i will never have.  so, i guess thats it. im done with trying to be around others, im done with building relationships, i am just done. theres no point in this. i will always be completely alone and there is nothing i can do to stop it.",2019-01-04 12:25:21,crisisnotcool,0
94vky0,my mum and her denial,depression,"basically my mum doesnt give a shit about me and my mental health. im not saying this because i feel like she doesnt care, im saying this because of various reasons, like: when i had my very first mental breakdown and spent 15 days crying in bed and sleeping without moving the only thing she did was telling me ""think about starving kids in africa theyre doing worst than you"" and then put the dog on my bed instead of conforting me herself. at that point i asked her to see a therapist. she allowed me to do that but, like she always does, she started to make me feel extremely guilty about the fact that we couldnt afford even that upon the other expences and telling me things like ""we have to pay your therapist so i dont know if well have money to go grocery shopping"". we had money for both since my father a month later bought a fucking vehicle for 3.000€, but still. shes always been like that.at first i though she didnt know what to do with depression and how to deal with someone who is depressed (which is very strange, considering her older brother passed away in an accident when she was around my age, which is 21/22, and that is the kind of thing that would probably make you feel depressed i guess), so i just forgave her and tried to pick myself up the best i could. then my brother had his breakdown, started hearing voices that werent there, stopped sleeping, started yelling in the middle of the night and writing stuff on the walls with a pen. of course my anxiety at this point got super bad, cause thing were basically falling apart with my ex, i had to give exams, i couldnt function and i was waking up at seven am by my mother who asked me to scrape off the words my brother wrote on the walls ""as quietly as you can"". i did. while having and anxiety crisis all the time i spent on the wall with a sponge erasing threats against every single member of my family of ""gutting us like animals"". then she became, like, *the best mum ever.* always there to give him support, always rushing over him and worrying, asking him stuff, trying her best to be close to him. and i got so mad, cause she was capable of being next to my brother, then why did she teated me the way she did in the past? then i realized. of course she didnt stayed close to me when i was ill: everything was going great with her. she only worried about me when she needed comfort and if i couldnt provide that because i was sick then she would ""worry"" (by which i mean making me feel guilty because i couldnt take no more). i went to live with my grandma for january cause i was super done with dying in anxiety and crying three hours per day when i wad okay, i needed a place to stay calm or i would just go insane. she helped me pack and gave me the key of the car, told me to have a ""nice trip"" and went back inside to check my brother.i went to my grandmas house crying hysterically and i didnt stop for hours. i just cried and cried until i was too exhausted and i slept. the morning after i told my ex-boyfriend that i was way too depressed to get out of bed and i couldnt see him and i was very sorry. he got angry (yeah, he was emotionally abusive as fuck, maybe one day ill write the story but he fucked me up pretty badly mentally), and i just shutted my phone up, got into bed and started writing suicide notes to my friends and my grandma. once i finished i realized that i couldnt go to the bathroom, let alone go to the top of a building and jump off.so i decide that i need medicine and i need therapy asap. where i live we have free healthcare, so i ask my mum to come with me to take the appointment with the psychiatrist. he saw me, diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and we started with medicines.my mum never asked me how it was. she never asks about medicines, my health, how im doing. the medicine arent working still and i never took that many pills in a lifetime, but she doesnt even notice that. she discovered i wad being medicated when i told my older brother about it in the living room and she reacted with a ""okay"". just an okay.i told her my diagnosis when i was hysterically crying because i just broke things off with my ex and she kept talking to me about what my father did that day that was *so wrong and shitty * she just didnt care that i was sobbing in the car next to her. what she told me? ""oh you think *im* not depressed?""then just kept on telling me how bad she was feeling and how life was cruel to her.meanwhile here i am, all alone at 21 years of age, with basically nothing cause my parents managed to burn down every single piece of property they couldve left to us, with a broken brain since i was so little i litteraly cannot remember when it started precisely, five attempted suicides. and my mum just wants to talk about how she fucked up her own life and she feels miserable about it. after i told my psychiatrist this he told me to go live to my grandmas, because my house was way too toxic and i could never improve there. i kept staying there for a while cause i felt guilty about living my brothers and my mum alone, but then my little brother (the one that probably has schizophrenia, but nobody in my family is willing to accept the problem and do something about it) almost punched me in the face because i asked him how he was doing.i am very petite girl with zero muscles cause i hate sports, my brother has harms as big as my head basically. he couldve busted badly my face in a matter of seconds, but luckly for me i have good reflexes, so i avoided it for the most part. he bruised my face though.i told my mum what happened via text and she didnt reply. she didnt say anything. than she said that i should be patient with my brother whom is *very sick and very angry.* that was the day i moved into my grandmas house and my mum thinks it is only because i am mad at her for no reason. like my whole life revolves around how she feels and what she wants. because she taught me that i can never feel bad or sad or angry when she is, she is the important one that needs to talk. i am the one that is supposed to listen to her problems since i was in elementary school. she litteraly took me from class when i was 8 to show me how badly my father punched her in the face. im sorry for the long posts, but i have a lot of shit im going through and im basically quitting every relationship with my mum whatsoever because of this. i just need her to give me money, cause she is supposed to and she promised me and i am in uni and cannot work because of my depression (my psychiatrist basically begged me not to find a job cause it would only make me feel worst). when ill feel better i will work my butt of and be indipendent and never speak to her ever again. but the fact is that i am dropping someone that to me was my *hero.* i love my mum so much, she can be kind and amazing and she protected me when my father wanted to kick the shit out of me, she tried to raise me alone the best she could and i just cant leave her behind without feeling like i have lost everything in my life. i feel like i hav nothing and i need to build an empire all by myself without the help of anybody, while having no arms and no idea of how to build said empire. everyday i think that dying would be the best option, but i cant die, i promised my best friend we would climb mount depression together and get to the top together.i just feel stuck in life. everyone that shouldve loved me no matter what just disappointed me again and again. my mum broke me to pieces and she doesnt even care. she has two sons and a doll that she can use however she wants, thats it. it sucks. it feels shitty to know that the person that choose to put you into this world just left you completely alone and was never there when you really needed that. now all she does is call me from time to time and tries to make me feel guilty about not helping her in our house and wanting to be here to do nothing. she knows i am depressed, that its bad, that i take way more medication than my brother and that im way more at risk than him. she just doesnt give a fuck and that sucks. like, a lot.",2018-08-06 00:55:52,crisisnotcool,1

acgk6m,i don't know how to tell me parents that i am too depressed/anxious to finish in an out-of-state university.,depression,"## my freshman and sophomore years at the university of washington went very well. then everything changed with no explainable reason. the last quarter of my sophomore year i got the best grades ive gotten in college and made the deans list for the first time, and a new girlfriend that i was crazy about. during that summer, i had another uneventful summer at home. i returned at the end of august to spend another year living with my friends in a residence that i preferred more than the year before. nothing had gone wrong and everything was looking up.on the first day of classes, i had my first panic attack. my heart and mind were racing, i had a lingering nausea, i couldnt focus on anything, and a full sense of emergency and a need to leave immediately. i made up an excuse about a doctors appointment to the friend i was sitting with and left mid-way through the first/syllabus introductory lecture i had scheduled for my first day of the quarter. i cried as quietly as i could in my bedroom the whole day.within a week or so, i went to my first psychiatrist and psychologist sessions. i was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. to be honest the depression diagnosis caught me off-guard. i thought i had just gotten extremely anxious.that was 2 years ago and now i realize that depression is likely the root of my anxiety. i feel like my existence is wasting everyones time by having anyone expend time or use resources on anything that goes toward or depends on my existence. i feel like a black-hole, minus anything interesting.my parents have sort of adjusted to the diagnosis that i received, which feels more accurate than ever. i even was cutting myself last year and somehow finished that quarter and continued on to the next, which i had to convince my mother to let me do (she knew). my dad asks now and then how well im holding up, with respect to my condition. my mother also experiences depression, and so is sometimes a vital resource and often the only one i can think to unload to for advice.i no longer feel this way. she lied to me about my ability to go back (which at the time i wanted), causing me to lose trust in her as a resource. i anguished and convinced her that going back was in my better interest. my dad is not always a great place to go to for advice, either. hes great, but like me, is not great to go to for advice. my mom can be... but will sometimes see the issues in me as something she can frustratidly lecture out of me. and those lectures, either through experience or learned anxiety, have sort of taught me to hide or sugar-coat my problems to her. a tldr for this paragraph would say: i have transitioned to a place where i feel very uncomfortable talking to my parents about my problems.since, i have started the first quarter of my last year at uw and i have completely failed. almost everything is at its very worst. i failed every single class (stopped doing anything school-related after week 6 of 10/didnt even go to finals + have not told my parents), im afraid to leave my room (literally pee in bottles sometime to avoid opening the door.... not proud+ so ashamed), i eat very little and never anytime near a regular meal should be scheduled, i am sick often, and just hate myself in general.i avoid stressful conversations until the very last minute... which brings us to now.i want to say that i want to come home. even though i am 3/4 the way through college, i cant continue. not on this trajectory, because i fear i may actually be dead if i keep trying (either through self infliction or my extremely poor health choices).how do i tell my parents that i need to abandon that which they have saved up for my entire life when i am so close to the finish line? im so close, have drained my college savings fund and then some+loans, social and emotional capital, and accrued personal shame to the point that i cannot talk to my close high school friends who have no clue to all these struggles.i feel 200% alone. i feel like i cant talk to friends or family, and at the same time i need to make a huge announcement to family and will need friends. i feel like i have neither as a resource and everything is as worse as ever.help me. how do i navigate this? at the very least, how do i tell my parents that after all of this, this is when i decide i can no longer do it. i am scared and dont know what it even looks like on the other side. if there is an other side.thanks to anyone who can give input.x",2019-01-04 11:28:25,squigglepound,1

8se0i1,like an oasis in the desert,depression,"for the past 5 years i have watched my mental health deteriorate and slip further down into the dark abyss. at first it was just a general feeling of sadness, tiredness, aimlessness, but soon it became so much more. over the course of the following years, i have tried to better myself, which led to losing close to all my friends. all the people that i have cared about for years and years – gone. then came the biggest punch… i had to face up to some grave mistakes of the past that i could no longer run from. this lead to losing the love of my life, my partner in crime, my soulmate in more than one way, my closest friend and lover of around 6 years. after that, absolute isolation followed. no matter how much i tried, nothing seemed to work, nobody seemed to want to connect with me. and so, further down i went the lightless rabbit whole. i am struggling a lot each day with almost every aspect of my life. every small task becomes more and more tiring, more and more difficult, more draining, more futile and there seems no end on the horizon. but tonight, tonight i had a wonderful experience. i went outside for one of my many aimless and lonely walks until i ended up at the city riverbank with a bottle of beer. sitting there on a bench, i noticed a couple of people around my age talking about something that seemed familiar to me. i wanted to try and talk to them; oh, how often i have been in this situation: the heart rate rises through the roof, all the blood rushes to the brain, only to result in absolutely nothing. one of many missed opportunities. but not this time. it did not matter what they would say. i had to try. so, i started talking to them…and they immediately invited me into their conversation, made room for me, and then we talked for hours and hours about the world and everything. like we had been friends of old. god damn, my heart was crying when i left them. all it took was one chance encounter and there it was: pleasant people. nice people. lovely people. people who seemed genuinely interested in talking to me. it was absolute bliss. sadly, i won’t be able to see them again much more, because they are leaving the country very soon. also, this by no means has stopped the bad thoughts. oh no! if anything, the bad voices were even keener than usual. always on the lookout to turn this awesome experience into something nasty and dark. even the thought of “ending it on a high note” kept creeping in multiple times. i hear my mind scream in agony. the desert is still very much there, lying ahead and all around me, but for now i am resting in this peaceful experience. this tiny oasis of mine that i found by chance. i will remain here for a while until i must move on again. still, now i know these places exist, and i might find another one before i give out under the merciless sun of this god forsaken place. i hope you people are all having a great night, or that a great day/night is coming to you soon. if i can be of help to any of you, just pm me!

(i live in japan)every single night i have night terrors and i often drown myself in alcohol to numb my sense of loneliness and basically knock me out every night. the night terrors still manages to jolt me awake.i hear constant voices in my head, telling me i’m a useless person and i should just kill myself. these voices are ever present and they happen every single day.i just wish i had someone to talk to on a personal level. a call or even in person. chatting with people online feels empty for me. i feel more relieved when i can see and hear the person i’m talking to. it gets rid of the voices in my head.i guess it’s only a matter of time before i start listening to these voices and just end it all.i’m tired of living this kind of life i never asked for.",2018-11-21 03:02:39,Keiichigo,0

9l5v6i,a really old childs game makes me realize how lonley i really am.,depression,"(its really late at night and i just kind of threw up my thoughts on page so i might repost this but fix it up so it could actually be more readable and fix some errors but im going to bed right now good night)the game is called toontown, its an old disney online game where you are toony animals (like micky mouse or donald duck) and you have to defeat evil robots called ""cogs"" that are trying to turn the toony world into a huge corporation, but the thing that makes me enjoy the game so much is that its impossible to complete the game alone, so its really easy to meet people and really good for lonely people to make friends just like you and me. god i remember how many good friends ive made on it. the connections are so strong is that you would load up the game and only come off if those special people arent online. there was this one guy called j.c, he was a brown smallish duck if i remembered correctly, he didnt speak good english but god we were basically best friends. 90% of the time when we were both online we would be together fighting cogs and just talking, making jokes and just generally bonding. 2 people on different sides of the planet just making good memories. but all good things come to an end, like i said, we would only be online if the other friend was online due to the game (like all games) getting stale after a while. 1 time i had to unexpectedly go for a week, i was 14 at the time so whenever i went somewhere for holiday i had no choice but to go. i was so excited to come back and play toontown with my friend, but he wasnt online, and of course the game itself was now stale for me but that didnt matter if i had friends online, but he wasnt. we were now both stuck in this mode where we would hop on 1 minute a day just to see if they were online but it they werent we would just go back offline. we never did get the timing right, and it began to go from 1 minute a day to check to 1 minute a week to 1 minute a month, until we eventually gave up. we never talked to each other since i came off for a week, not because we didnt want to, but because couldnt be waiting for weeks. now his status on the game was ""online more than than a year ago."" sometimes i think about it and realise that since i was 14 i never really had a good connection with someone like j.c before, and that was in a video game. im 17 now. it makes me depressed just thinking about it, how do i get that feeling again that theres someone thats only there for you? how have i never had a best friend like that? will i ever find like someone like that again? or am i going to be my only best friend? i mean, i have friends but theres always that thought that they dont really care that much about you. i suppose i should just be thankful that i have these memories. thank you j.c.another person i met in toontown was this pink cat, named princess glory. holy. shit. i will never forget about this person. shes probably the most nicest people ive ever met and we had such a good connection. like, super duper good. it got to the point where i would stay up at 1am just to chat with her. ( she lives in america while i lived in the uk so timezones where weird which means she only came online really late for me ) fuck school, i want to spend time with this person, nothing is a better feeling that when they come online, they straight away teleport to you, do the ""wave hand"" emote, and then ask how was your day. the most powerful feeling from our relationship was probably how we went from nothing to basically best friends. at first, when i added her to my friends list, we really didnt talk. everybody have those people on their friends list that you did one thing with and then never spoke to them again, we were going to be like those ""friends."" we probably would but for some strange reason i really tried to talk to her, i would remember asking questions or just trying to make talk with her anyway possible. i would type, press enter, then fucking run to the other side of the room because i would be scared on what they would say or how she would react lol. ( im really shy if you cant tell ) that feeling of risking it all ( although i really wasnt ) was so thrilling for me. and its not like i could just press an entry key and talk to people in real life.over a while, of me forcing myself to join her lobbies in defeating bosses then me making talk we came closer and closer. its a really good feeling when you always been starting conversation with the person but then they start to talk to you instead of the other way round. our relationship grew bigger and bigger.im not going to lie, i grew a crush on a pink cat. while it didnt last long as i found out she has a husband and a kid, toontown definitely got me to know the feeling for the first time in my life, and currently my only time. i mean, ive had crushes before but like ive said, im shy and we never really had a good connection. princess glory was completely different, finally a girl who i have a really good connection with. i loved every single second of us talking.we would of kept chatting forever if the timezones werent so bad. sometimes the weight forces you down. while i loved this person, playing a game that gone stale for me ages ago, and also staying up at 1am just to wait for them to come online, its really dis motivating. i eventually stopped going online, and its my fault this time, unlike with j.c where i didnt have a choice to leave, this time i did and i fucked it up. now princess glory is currently at ""offline over a year ago"" and i have no idea if i will ever chat with her again. god, i miss that feeling so fucking much, you have no idea.the whole point of this is that god i missed having people like that in my life. according to my mum i might be autistic and i used to think i will eventually get to meet people like that again, but now with this information, i actually have no idea, and it hurts to fucking much. i have might have a disability that effects me from talking to people. all i want are these connections again, i want people in my life that have the strong feelings of friendship and love which is equal for both sides. and im scared guys, in not sure if i will be able to meet anyone like that again, or feel this special feeling again. if im being 100% honest i get really depressed thinking about it, but at the same time i love it.princess glory or j.c, if your reading this, thank you so fucking much for the memories :). i love you guys.",2018-10-04 01:05:50,Mrhollywood03,0

acdx15,"at the point in this cycle where ""maybe i don't need medication? maybe i'm not crazy?""",depression,"i stopped taking abilify cold turkey in november.  ive been out of adderall since september.  im still taking wellbutrin but im not sure what it does, and im considering going off that as well, just to see where im at after a few weeks of not taking anything.  i havent been completely unmedicated since...2009?  although the cocktail of meds has been switched up a little since then.  anyways, all that is to say, i dont know whats me anymore.and like...i know that can be the kind of language people who are fundamentally against medication use, or who may have pseudoscientific beliefs about mental health, to dissuade others from taking medication, or to discredit the concept of psych meds.  like that medication can make you lose yourself, turn you into a zombie, etc.  and i can also get behind the ""if you cant make your own seratonin, store bought is fine"" kind of mentality too.  just, ive been medicated pretty much since puberty, and the breaks ive taken without medication have been brief.  i stopped taking abilify because i connected the extreme fatigue i was experiencing to that medication (plus not having money for the refill), and it got me wondering if there are other components of my personality or health that i currently take for granted that may also be side effects of drugs.  its possible that i dont really *know* what my baseline is anymore, right?  im not going as far as to convince myself that medication is causing my depression, but maybe my shit is more manageable now than it used to be, and i just dont know it?  or like, if i stop taking medication long enough, and let myself reset, it will be more clear what my symptoms and needs are?  but then i also have a hormonal iud, and ive heard people say that the mirena has caused depression for them...so even if i stop taking my psych meds, what if my fucking birth control is making me depressed too?  how can i ever know what the hell is happening with me?i dunno.  im diagnosed bipolar, and theres such a stereotype of bipolar folks just up and quitting their medication because theyre fucking crazy people.  but really, mood stabilizers can make you feel terrible.  antipsychotics can make you feel terrible.  and im just tired of not knowing whether i feel like garbage because of medication or because its who i am.and then, of course im concerned about being completely unable to survive without medication, and im worried that i cant even last without medication long enough to figure any of this out.  i just cant imagine being completely dependent on medication for the rest of my life though, especially when i have developed so much physically and mentally since i was initially medicated.  i was first medicated when i was 13, and im almost 29 now.  it feels important to figure this out, because i think ill always wonder if im actually crazy or if im just dependent on meds.  its just really daunting to not know what to expect.im seeing a new psychiatrist tomorrow, out of convenience more than my interest in her--a friend has a new practice and was able to make me an appointment with their psych for tomorrow.  hopefully shes helpful, but i kind of dont know what to say to her.  writing this out has helped give me a sense of what to say, so thanks if youve read this.id appreciate any insight on these sort of feelings that yall might have.  im at a really low point currently, really not feeling capable of the self-care sort of maintenance things people recommend in place of medication, plus i work at night in the service industry so im just too fucking tired to take care of myself.  but i would like to hear other peoples perspectives on these sort of feelings.  thanks <3",2019-01-04 05:27:13,att4ck_,1

(btw my mum heard and saw everything so i dont know why she was lying) yeah, onto the next one. my brother who is definitely got something wrong with him. he cries constantly, over literally nothing, you could poke him lightly and he would cry. he also shits himself constantly like atleast 3 times a week. he doesnt even notice it either (oh btw his age is in the double digits) then i have two little sisters, too young to notice any major abnormalities. the youngest of the two is probably the most mature out of my siblings(except from me of course) the other sister is a little brat though. now, enough about my siblings. my stepdad woooooo, oh my god do i have a story to tell. he has temper tantrums all the time if its something one of the kids done, a game he played etc. he tries to act all high and mighty all the time. it actually angers me cus he also has the mental capacity of a child. i feel like hes in the middle of transforming into a female, cus its like hes on his period constantly. my mother is actually normal though, which (thank the lord) is good. me, i guess im not normal, im not abnormal though so i guess im just in the limbo of normality. forgot to mention that none of my siblings have learning disabilities or anything, aparrently theyre all quite school smart. thats not to say that people with learning disabilities arent smart, im just saying. so yeah, tl;dr: depression has lead me down a good road that has increased how healthy my brain is, even if that ive had to suffer in the process.",2018-07-04 17:55:47,BigSuperXdJeff,1

88n3mo,"don't read this, i don't deserve sympathy",depression,"here goes another desperate callout for help. my last few posts havent gotten any attention, used to it by now though so im not too bothered. laying in bed at night thinking about how bad my choices in life has been, thinking about how unfair im being treated. being alone in this world sucks ass, the people i like arent always active in my life. i was already accustomed to loneliness from when i was a young boy, so its no matter to me.as selfish as it is i wish people acknowledged my existence. family doesnt really help, so i stay locked away in my bedroom hoping for some acknowledgement from the people i like. they have lives though, i dont. im only an inconvenience to anyone. the only time people bother with me is if it benefits them. i have a boring life, that alone has started to make me slowly give up on life... my social life... education...work etc etc.i thought i was a selfless, caring, funny guy, i thought i would  be popular, i thought i would be an achieving student. haha, turns out im selfish, careless and boring, no friends, barely achieving passing grades.   the people i make friends with usually have problems(im not disrespecting anyone here) whenever i try and turn my life around, the curse starts to work its black magic hoodoo voodoo shit. i start crying, having a mental breakdown, then i go to reddit to see if i can get attention like the whore i am.if i died right now no one would notice. thats how much of a useless life i am. why cant thiscurse end my life instead of torture me. i know other people have worse lives, i understand that. but ive been struggling with my life since i was little, like little little. ive had this curse since i was born. all my life ive been like thiswriting shit like this really doesnt help me either.  well sorry for wasting your time anyways....",2018-04-01 03:48:18,BigSuperXdJeff,0

(if anyone has read this far i applaud your efforts)if i told my mother she would probably be nice about it, hopefully. my stepdad on the other hand, might not take it very well. just thinking about all of this it feels like my heart is going to pop, i mean college is nice and all, but its really started getting to me. last year the tutors were nice, and i could kinda keep up with the workload. this year tutors have started being right assholes, i can keep up with the work but its basically the same shit from the previous course i took. ive gotten so bored of it. basically all thats keeping me from leaving is 1 person that i go to the shops with almost every day( at college) we have an idea to take a college grant, or some sort of grant so we can set up our own pet shop, thats a nice idea. but i doubt i could be of any help to him. if just bring him down. im pretty sure ive tod him about my depression, and hes kept the same as he always has, which i find very nice, but also weird. cus most other people tend to be more wary of me, or leave. hes just like yeh whatever hes still a person. it actually comforts me every time im alone with him. theres another guy im friends with i guess, but hes a right cunt(ironic how im being a 2 faced ass to him right now)its 1:37 in the morning right now, and instead of sleeping, im writing this shitty essay of a rant. i could also be doing the tons of work i have but i cba. i really need some help. but i cant ask it from anyone, cus it will make them hate me, like it always has done. i think i really jus tneed more people to talk to. cus everyone has their own lives and i just feel bothersome. i have 3 people i truly trust with all my heart. 1 of them has a control freak girlfriend, 1 of them lives in a diffenent country and the other is the one previously mentioned. i dont like messaging first because i always feel like its at a bad time, or at an important time or them. i really should stop ranting now. 1:41 at night.need to wake up in 5 hours and a bitif anyone would like to give some advice or just talk to me, do it on my snaochat, cus for some reason i dont get notifications from reddit (dombozorino)",2018-03-06 03:41:53,BigSuperXdJeff,1

acbkep,ex fell into depression after our break-up,depression,"tl;dr hey reddit, i was hoping yall could help me out with some reading material on depression. i want to know more about how i can help my friends and family. 2 years ago, i broke up with her when she moved away to her home country. i hoped shed have her old friends, and being back home will make it easier, especially after all this time. i think she was feeling down before we even broke up, but i didnt know what to do once she started closing up. turns out she spiraled into depression, im not sure how bad. her best friends arent doing much better either, both struggling with various levels of depression. we, and another friend of hers, met for a holidays vacation. i still valued our friendship, and was excited to join both of them on the trip, on which we did have some great experiences and memories.by the last day, despite feeling like she was still closed up in her own world, i was able to get her to open up a bit, and found out about the horrible time shes been having back home. parents and sister living in 2 other countries to begin with, and her friends struggling with their own issues, she started blaming herself for the failed relationships.she seems to be assuming responsibility for whatever mistakes shes made, but instead of learning from it and moving on, she keeps blaming herself over and over. she seems swarmed with emotions and/or feelings (taking meds for it, dont know which one), and is always afraid that shes failing her parents, and her friends. shes afraid of falling out of love, so after a long string of unhealthy hook-ups, a normal healthy relationship has become irrelevant.she buries herself in work, sometimes even not answering messages from her close friend circle. instead deciding to go out on her own, probably going home with yet another damaging fling.i do still care about what happens to her, especially since our breakup was because of circumstances. i got her to promise that she will try to open up more to close friends. i promised i would be there to listen her whenever she wants to talk to someone. she seemed a bit more optimistic by the end of the trip.at this point i want to learn as much as i can about depression, and what i can do to help. ive had friends go through depressive moods before. even a friend contemplating suicide, that some friends and me talked him out of it. i feel like current mental health knowledge isnt keeping up with the rapid changing of our society. i want to be even more aware and ready to help the people i surround myself with.thanks for reading, wish you all the best!

ac6q0q,"i'm better, and i want to share it with you",depression,"hi everyone,ive been lurking a lot and doing my small contributions to this subreddit and i felt like there is too much ""going bad"" post so i just wanted to help changing it.first, i know how little this can help others, and i dont want to patronize or sell fake positivity. i just wanted to share my experience.i had a really deep depressive episode 2-3 years ago. i was living abroad for work, my first one, and i have to say... i wasnt prepared. i had also serious health issues (pancreatitis due to gall stones) that made me nauseous and not wanting to eat for a long time. and being new at work as i was, i was constantly making errors and feeling miserable for that (i worked at bio research so an error could easily cost a few hundred € and hours of hard work).i wasnt prepared to cope with all that pressure at all. but i wasnt prepared to face the fact that i had to stop working at this job (which i didnt want to realise i hated) and find a new one.i suppose one big issue was... i wasnt being honest with myself. but i started going to therapy with a psychologist, i took some decisions and started a journey that i am still in.i wrote a post about how i felt depression ""cycles"", i will post it in the comment section. but i dont want to talk specially about that. i just wanted to say i am feeling better. with time and help, i am in a point of my life i never thought i could be 3 years ago. i actually enjoy my new work (though sometimes i still feel a lot of pressure), i regained self confidence, and i am still learning to be kind to myself.in fact, one the most useful advice i was given was, if you wouldnt say something to another person, dont say it to yourself. treat yourself like you would treat others. i used to say to myself really mean thing (""you piece of shit, coward, youre weak, youre useless"" and so on) but then i realised i was being too hard to myself.i still have my highs and lows, and i will always have. but i am starting to understand myself and i this experience helped me grow into a better, more self-respectful person.i hope this encourage others in the same situation. also, please, if you have any advice that you think can help others, share it here. i think one of the best ways to fight depression is to talk about it, and thats why i think this subreddit is so great.",2019-01-03 17:30:01,fran_grc,1
ac6kwq,i get depressed hearing about other people's successful sex lives when comparing to my virginity,depression,"im a 21 year old virgin that only has one semester left of college, where its apparently easiest to get laid in. i have tried tinder, and i fucking fail at it. first off, i barely get matches, and secondly, ive only met up with 17 women last semester but they were all coffee dates, none of them led to a hookup. and when i try to be flirty, they all ghost/unmatch me.  i even post a lot asking for help on /r/tinder, but no one can give me advice that works for my profile. it makes me feel like i have no hope and that im just ugly as shit. since its only about looks on tinder, and i only get 1 match a day, im fucking hideous. but then, every other dude gets laid on tinder. it seems like they dont have to try and girls just wanna have sex with them. people are like ""dont use tinder unless you want a quick hookup"", and ive been using it for years never having gotten a hookup, and its only gonna get harder outside of college. i just dont want to be a virgin anymore. i want to feel wanted by someone of the opposite sex enough that i will lose my virginity (meaning i dont want an escort).

9bf2is,at a lost [rant],Anxiety,"im having an issue right now and i just really need to rant to get this off my chest. a little background, i work as a delivery driver for a major hardware store. ive been in this position since the start of the year and though i really enjoy it, it gives me anxiety really badly since appliances are very expensive, heavy, and houses are not built to take these in and out easily so we have to be very careful. since my anxiety is so bad, im extremely careful and anal-retentive about each stop and some of my coworkers hate me for it since im not rushing to get home like all the other drivers. in turn, those drivers get a lot of damages on their heads and hearing about their fuck ups helps me become extra careful. now on with the story.so i go into work today feeling okay. im off tomorrow and i knew it was going to be a quick and easy day so i went in with no issue. i was hearing around that everyone in our department was to get a raise. i had myself set on talking up my raise since i have much more training than anyone else and have done all of this extra stuff for my department.i do my first few things in the morning before starting my route when my manager wanted to speak to me. now, i should also state, a week ago, i made a booboo and caught a tree on one of our trucks. there was no way to avoid it with where my truck was at, it was either the side of the truck or run into the customers other tree and his fence. it made a good size gash in the truck so it was getting repaired. i immediately texted my manager pictures and explained everything. did drug test since i was driving, blah blah blah. i finally came down from the attack that caused after my manager talked me down explaining things happen, itll be ok. well, he starts off by asking me if i wanted to guess how much itll be, i openly admitted i didnt want to know. he starts telling me numbers and i can feel my face go white. i knew it was going to be big and i felt like shit for doing what i did, but had he stopped there, i couldve easily been able to go through my day, but he continues. he tells me this past month, my customers have been calling saying ive damaged their items. he has gone out their personally and looked and confirmed it was something we wouldve done. may it have been a dolly, strapped down, hauling it in, whatever. all he said was it didnt look like a customer did it themselves just to get a discount. hes telling me the damages are in the thousands. now i feel myself shaking, starting to choke up, tears welling up. i was mad, upset, confused above all since i knew i wouldnt have gone through a delivery with a damage and not noticed it. i will beat myself till ive worked 9 days straight to make up for a small scratch on a fridge. i do not let myself forget a single damage. i strap everything down with every protection i could find. i will restrap what my rider has done if they didnt do it up to my standards. hell, i stopped letting my riders take stuff in anymore even if its heavy (im a small guy) just so i know its going in safely since they dont give a damn (and in the end ill get the blame for it anyways). ive also never seen our dollies do damages to items. they have rubber padding on the side where items get strapped to and have never dealt with it. i started shaking my head no to him. i told him how everyone knows im anal about each and every stop and all he says is ""i know, which i find weird all of this is happening, but i just need you to be careful from now on"". all i could do was say ok. if it wouldve been a more private setting, i wouldve demanded to see pictures, know the customers just so i knew, but all i could say was ""ok"". he finally tells me that its just between me and him. no one else knows, not even the store manager.my first few stops, i tried to hold back tears. i couldnt help but run through every single stop ive done this past month and think back on damages i couldve done. my blood pressure was probably at a dangerous level, but i couldnt stop myself. i texted him later saying i didnt want my raise, how i didnt deserve it. he calls me an hour later saying how i cant back out of my raise, i deserved it. he then says how shit happens, itll be fine. well just keep it between us and itll be ok. all i could say was ok.ive never told him i have anxiety since there was never really a time to tell him, but i feel like he can tell. he knows im beating myself up right now and hes trying his best to calm me down, but i cant help but think that i have customers that are seriously just out for a quick buck and im getting the shoe for it. i thank him for calming me down, but goddamit, i need answers! i cant live with the fact i left my customers with a damaged item!i was hoping to getting on anti-anxiety medicine so i could calm down, but this just makes me not want to get on it since i feel like ill be too lax and fuck more shit up. since i cant talk myself out of the raise (that i still feel like i dont deserve), i just wont talk it up even if i feel its too small. apparently i havent been doing as good a job i thought i was.",2018-08-30 03:58:38,CarlEatshands,1

4k710x,my health is disabling and killing me. fiancee left me. no money to do anything about it. am i allowed to drift away yet?,depression,"its jumbled. sorry. i dont know what im doing. ive sold my car, quit college and my job and moved back in with my parents now that ive been sick in bed for months. something happened back in early high school, now my brain is being starved of oxygen as a result. my legs are now permanently damaged and possibly parts of my head. ill more or less be a potato long before i turn 30. stopping it is at least $82,500 out of my budget. and who knows how long it will take to reverse. during the tests for all that, they found what might(probably) be testicular cancer. i understand why my fiancée left me, its hard dealing with another person in this state. it still came as a sudden surprise and hurts like nothing ever has before; not tragic family death, not injury. it has to be a dream... she was the only reason i was really fighting all this. its taken me a day and a half to work up the energy to get on reddit like this. in elementary and middle school i was on anti-depressants for a whole molestation thing, but eventually ended them, all being mostly forgotten. today ive been on anti-depressants for about a month and a half now, as prescribed to people who might be facing death. now that shes gone they clearly do nothing anymore. actually it doesnt seem like they did anything before, even after increasing the dosage eight fold. probably the chemical. i dont care anymore. im incapacitated. ive been dreaming too long. i want to wake up like i used to. i know depression kills your ability to be productive in about every way. with all my health piled on that, the mountain looks more than impossible to climb. if things turn out better than they expect what then? ive invested all these years into a person that filled a hole in me that video games, work, or hobbies, or friends never did. we were so close to being together forever, and i just failed. everything failed. she threw it in my face, got a boyfriend within the day and a half since she left, and now hates me. shes been rubbing him in my face, talking about how well he takes care of her and how healthy he is. she never acted like this before... not even close. i guess shes been bottling it up longer than i know. our families are so mixed. i have no idea how to talk about it. the wedding was late next fall. my friends... they loved her. how do i talk about it to anyone? im ashamed to say anything. i truly dont want to talk about it. its all my fault, and theyll know it. im scared of them now. it would take so much energy to deal with them too. part of me wants to think she still loves me and is just lashing out because of the lack of attention. all i have to do is get my health together and job back... ha.if i build up enough strength to work, why? im just dead soon anyways. my bucket list is, you could say, complete. ive helped enough people to feel good about my existence. ive fulfilled something at least. i really dont have any regrets or dreams. the only thing i had in mind was raising her children. i want to think that im at my lowest and ill get better, but everything points down. why does death have to be so inevitable and in my face, yet so far away? ive tried going on a walk, eating favorite foods, watching my favorite movies/shows. walking was too difficult, food i threw up, and media hurts my head. is there anything i can distract myself with while both hopeless and immobile? i need something to completely take me away. im starting to remember again what happened to me as a kid... the last six months ive been sleeping 14-18 hours a day, every day. now that shes gone i cant dare to sleep. sleep means letting my mind drift off to pain i dont want to feel. im not ready to feel it. the news was already like ripping away my ribs, right through the skin with an industrial claw. if i let my head feel anymore it will get into my heart and i will truly break. i feel like im holding up a crumbling sand caste in pushing off sleep and activity. i need that distraction that can make the sand a bit more wet and clumpy. before she left i might have posted something like this on /r/suisidewatch, but now death is as scary as sleep. its just that i dont know why; im baffled, i should want death. i used to only a few days ago. even tears... they just cant come out. i wish i could leave this house and do... something. this whole city... ive been everywhere with her, done everything before that. now i cant physically do it nor is she by my side nor can i help but think about a life before being sick. thats if im not too apathetic to want help that day. im locked here by so many giants. every time i emotionally make progress with one thing the other cuts me down to the bottom again. stupid and odd reference but think of it like ganking in dark souls. one on one is a fair fight; anyone skilled or lucky enough can overcome any other player. when facing two+ there is almost no chance. beaten down and cant stand... i just want to lay on the floor until they stop kicking. if there is any brightness to this, i can at least return the engagement ring to buy enough anti-depressants for a few years. otherwise, im in debt with everything else and in too much physical pain to work. i cant look the people im burdening in the eyes anymore. they cant afford to have me on their couch, i know it. im so weak. i cant hold anything i love. nothing is interesting, but thats normal i guess. tl;dr help me escape. anything. youre reddiors, masters of distraction.edit: words. paragraphs.  edit: 2017: got worse. but im not dead.

(major depression, bipolar depression, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, ptsd... it felt like they were just throwing things at me left and right after a while.)ive been out of treatment and off medications (which was a choice of mine) for a year and a half now and in that time ive been functioning better than i ever could have imagined and very stable overall and have been since i stopped treatment (which seemed to be doing more harm for me than good). however, over the past week or so ive been noticing the physical symptoms of anxiety creep back up but im not experiencing any sort of anxious thoughts when it happens. i feel agitated and on edge, restless, and have had trouble sleeping. there have been a few times ive felt short of breath and start shaking and feel dizzy. ive lost my appetite. i feel worn down and like i cant relax. its really all of the symptoms i used to experience when my anxiety would flare up but this is happening when im doing random things like working, playing a video game, or even in a good, positive mood. ive studied and practiced enough cbt to know to pay attention to my thoughts when this happens to stop any anxious ones but there arent any, its just the physical sensations. today i was in the middle of work and had a panic attack out of nowhere while i was joking around with coworkers.im relatively healthy, a 29 year old female, and havent had any changes in diet or anything. i take vitamins and exercise so it doesnt seem like an underlying physical health condition. has anyone experienced this before? i know depression can manifest itself in this way due to biochemistry but i havent heard about anxiety doing that. if you have experienced it, what helped? normal calming techniques for anxiety and panic attacks are based on controlling your anxious thoughts but if there arent any im not sure what to do, you know? any feedback is appreciated! thanks!",2016-08-19 09:26:27,8bit-meow,1

85o3c2,fx's unedited airing of 'straight outta compton' (tits and all),offmychest,"disclaimer: im a white guy who grew up in the 90s, but in a fairly predominantly white area. ive never really gotten into rap/hip hop and i fully recognize i will never truly be able to relate to the average experiences of an african american. as ""woke"" as id like to think of myself being, in spite of my upbringing and the clearly racist points of view ive seen in my own family, there is still a lot i have to learn and understand. that being said, i am a little perplexed by the decision by fx to air the movie, ""straight outta compton, earlier this month, in its r-rated uncensored format.now, i understand the cultural significance of the group nwa, even if ice cube has gone hollywood and hasnt really played up the hardcore ""gansta"" persona he once embodied. im sure his ideals and views havent changed, but it could be assumed that given enough money, anyone can play nice with ""the man."" i dont mean to be disrespectful, but lets be honest, its a long way from ""fuck the police"" to are we there yet?in any case, not censoring the language, especially when it comes to the use of the n-word, makes sense. it is a huge part of who nwa was and to hide the language is to essentially hide the reality of the time and the message that nwa was trying to get out there. sadly, that message still rings true and many of the same people who refused to listen back then, still choose to be ignorant today. the n-word is problematic, i get it, but i wont deny the use of it, by the right people, in the right context, if it helps educate others. thats all i really have to say on the issue of the unedited airing in terms of langue. swearing doesnt bother me and i dont go around tossing out slurs all day, so i wasnt put off by those words appearing on basic cable during prime time.i also wasnt put off  by the decision to leave in the female nudity. most of the subreddits i am subscribed to are all about the female form and such. i am no prude, but we are in the middle of a movement of female empowerment. i do find myself wondering how the nudity was considered culturally relevant. the fact that many of the films fx has aired in the past have had white female nudity edited out, could be seen as a racist double standard. the fact that soc was based on real events doesnt make the nudity any more or less necessary. they could have just as easily implied the nudity. it could also be seen as another example of hollywood objectifying the female form, regardless of the race of the women involved.again, i wasnt bothered by seeing an completely raw cut of the film shown on tv. fx took great pains to inform viewers that the program may not be suitable for all audiences, but we have such a bug up our collective asses in this country when it comes to sexuality and nudity that i almost expect more people to have been truly offended by bare breasts than the use of the n-word.im probably not making much sense and my point may be lost. i just wonder if anyone else was curious about the logic behind equating nudity to language in terms of cultural significance. tldr: fx aired soc with the n-word and nudity left in. i feel like it could be seen as pandering or a double standard. i worry people who are less likely to want to ask questions or learn anything will just get offended and angry without knowing why.i like boobs. i hate racism.",2018-03-20 01:22:46,ViscoInferno,0
7npaw7,its times like this that i really wish i had even one close friend to turn to for advice.,offmychest,"in the hopes of keeping this simple, im recently divorced and starting to get back into dating. my confidence level is not the highest, but im tired of being alone. i should try to meet some other guys who are closer to my age and life experiences, but i havent really gotten along with men as easily as i have with women, but i have also never really had many close friends. my ex-wife was the first best friend i have had and, well, that didnt pan out.so, now im on tinder. im not exactly looking for a hookup, but i would not turn it down either. i guess the women in my area dont use tinder for casual sex, so i havent had that exchange as of yet. however, two different women, both of whom have the same first name, have shown interest. they are pretty similar in personality, body type, and even in interests. ive been upfront about the fact that i am talking to other people and i have even joked that i should just introduce them to one another and use tinder to help people make new friends.ive been on one very laid back date with each of them and i am hoping to see each of them again. the only issue is that its too early to say if either is what i really am looking for. i owe it to myself to be picky, but i dont want to be shallow either. no, neither is going to be a victorias secret model or a suicide girl, but neither is at all unattractive to me. im no brad pitt myself, so i have no business putting such high standards on anyone else. i do feel physical attraction is important, however i do need the emotional/intellectual attraction as well. im almost more desperate for good conversation as i am for the chance to get laid.i told both women i would not be sleeping around so if things progress further with anyone, id let the other(s) know that im no longer available.so, thats the odd situation i find myself in. my anxiety isnt too bad about this, it actually has given me a bit of an ego boost. if it were so easy to just sleep with each woman so i could have that much more information to go on, it might help, but im not a player by any means. i barely know what the rules of ""the game"" are to begin with.",2018-01-02 22:52:27,ViscoInferno,1

76dfzl,what makes/made you stay?,SuicideWatch,"i often find myself thinking i dont really have the nerve to go through with killing myself. whether its fear that ill screw up and just leave myself seriously disabled in some way or concerns that for the few people in my life that i believe do care about me, i always manage to talk myself out of it, whenever i start thinking about how much i want to die.its not like im at all religious or worried about my eternal soul, but i even have the smallest of doubts of my own atheism and disbelief in such things. yet, even then i just find myself questioning the logic of a so-called loving god whod allow all the pain and suffering in the world.im extremely pessimistic and my views on humanity are less than favorable. my impending divorce has left me devastated and the accompanying loneliness has only added to my depression. ive posted numerous times, lamenting over my lack of confidence and the struggles ive had to find a place where i belong. ive had way too much time alone with my thoughts and i keep coming to the same conclusion. the best thing i can think of doing with my life is to end it.still, i just cant muster up the motivation to even do that. instead i sit alone in my room, in coffee shops, bookstores, and mall food courts, wondering where it all went wrong and wishing i knew how to change a single thing. i havent come up with anything of note, just more distractions.if i were to decide that i truly have lost all hope and that i no longer care enough to try, id wait for my next birthday and end it all then. until then, im curious to know what has helped pull others out of the darkness. what finally helped other people turn away from that bottomless pit of despair. i have to imagine that others here have come close enough to suicide that something changed in them to alter their perception.what exactly happened, what was said or done to snap you out of it? im open to detailed explanations, instead of being told to volunteer or see a therapist. i may skeptical, but at this point ive got nothing left to lose.my future consists of debt from a failed marriage, the monotony of a dead end job, and nothing close to a social life to help get my mind off of things. im not sure what else to do, so what have others done?",2017-10-14 20:23:33,ViscoInferno,0
75jzbe,"i don't want to go ""home.""",depression,"it has been just over a month since i moved back in with my dad. a week beforehand my wife told me she wanted a divorce. it was the day before her birthday and almost a month away from our 5th anniversary. things werent great by that point and i suppose i knew it was coming, but i still clung to the hope that my wife would eventually make an effort to fight for us. sadly, she chose her friends and her new lifestyle over me. her own sister thinks my wife is being stupid, but its an empty victory to hear such things. its hard to feel validated when im still losing everything even if it isnt all my fault.my dad doesnt seem to mind the company, hes been living in the same apartment for nearly 30 years. in that time, my sister has lived there, moved out, moved back in, and out again a number of times. this is only my second time living under my dads roof and he admits i am easier to live with than my sister. my mom also offered up a room in her house, but the further distance cancels out the larger living space. besides, my dad and i havent always been as close as my mom and i. i am making up for lost time.both my parents, my whole family in general, are not without their faults and just about every relationship has been strained at one time or another. in spite of the emotional distance, my family is all i have in times like this and i cant really afford a place of my own.i have never been good at making friends, i get along with others well enough, but i never get that close with anyone. aside from my soon to be ex-wife, i have never had a true best friend. my social life has always been lacking and i typically prefer to stay home. near the end, my wife would be gone all weekend with her friends while i sat home alone with the dogs.its been nearly eight years since ive been on a date and even longer since i had any sort of regularly scheduled meet up with friends. i find myself going stir crazy sitting in my small bedroom every night after work. my dad is very tight with his money, so theres no internet and the cable he does have is the most basic level available. i lose interest in the few movies or video games i have and sitting alone in the library, just so i can get onto the free wifi, is getting old fast.ive scoured meetup for groups to join and theres very little of interest. im not at all religious nor am i into anything sports-related. im admittedly out of shape and never cared for physical activities. i have always hated bars and dance clubs. im not a drinker, i dont smoke, and i dont use drugs. despite my socially liberal views and my attempt to be open-minded, im pretty square and vanilla.shy, socially awkward, a dark sense of humor, and a general distaste for society all add up to a smug, elitist, misanthrope who has never felt like hes ever fit in anywhere. i honestly feel like i have no sense of identity or self worth. this desperation shows and its probably why i seem to attract the wrong kind of people.all i know is that sitting alone in a coffee shop is getting old fast, but i dont want to go home, especially when it doesnt feel like ""home."" i had a home and i lost it. now im stumbling around, trying to find something/someone/someplace that feels safe.

70ivys,struggling more and more each day...,SuicideWatch,"ive posted about how i am about to get a divorce. long story short, i feel as if i did everything i could to be a good husband, mainly in terms of being there for her in sickness and in health. she has endometriosis and ever since we began dating, shes been dealing with related issues and ive been there for her always. countless trips to the er/hospital and many doctors appointments. she had major surgery on the other side of the state two years ago and i took 3 weeks off to care for her as she recoverd.she has almost always been too sick, sore, tired, or nauseous to want to do much and we havent had much of a social life and more or less no sex life either. after the surgery, she got off a lot of her usual meds, they only caused more trouble with the side effects, and got approved for medicinal marijuana. we discussed this beforehand and i was fine with it. the pot and a new diet helped her lose nearly 50 pounds and her self esteem grew.at this point, i admit that her health problems were taking a toll on me. i felt taken for granted and unappreciated. i also was starting to struggle with depression and anxiety. my temper worsened and it drove a bigger wedge between my wife and i. she begged me to begin seeing a therapist and/or getting on antidepressants. ive done both. i realized that the marriage was at risk once my wife began hanging out with new friends and spending less time with me. once she brought up the idea of having an open marriage, i should have realized it was over.despite the fact that i had kept asking her if we were done, she continued to protest the idea of divorce. however, her new lifestyle centered on going out with friends, getting high, and spending a lot of time with other men. we stopped sharing a bed and more or less stopped talking. i was and still am convinced she has been cheating on me, but she still denies it. even if she wasnt sleeping with anyone else, she still made the choice to spend her time with others, to share her thoughts and feelings with them and cut me out of her emotional mindset.she finally told me she wanted a divorce the day before her birthday, nearly a month before our 5th anniversary. ive since moved back in with my dad. she no longer will even talk to me so i can get ahold of the necessary papers so i can take responsibility for my personal debts. shes keeping the furniture and staying in the rental property we lived in, as it is owned by her uncle. she has taken my entire life from me, i have nothing, she has everything, and now she is becoming such a bitch to me that i absolutely hate her. the last 7 years of my life have been for nothing.now i am stuck at my dads with no internet, poor cable, and nothing of my own. i have no friends or any social life. my confidence is shot and i have so much anxiety even talking to strangers that im unable to work up the nerve to go out and try to make friends. ive never been good at making relationships that last. ive never had a best friend, aside from my wife. im lonely and bored and frustrated. i have no privacy at home, so i cant even jerk off to alleviate that frustration.before i moved out, my wife confessed she is pansexual and polyamorous. thats fine and dandy, but she could have saved me so much heartache if she had come to that conclusion about who she truly is, before we even got engaged. i no longer feel like i can even trust another woman. from what ive seen on the couple of dating apps ive checked out, there appears to be a lot of poly/pan women out there. i am open-minded, but i am just not that ""progressive"" i guess. im almost 39 and many the women my age already have kids and most of them are educated and have actual careers. i work in a factory and have nothing.getting into another relationship is not the answer for me, but i cant even get a simple hook-up if i wanted. i dont know how to talk to people and i nearly panic every time im in crowed places. simply put, i feel completely inept and useless. i am miserable and unable to see anything improving. i feel, at this point, that the most productive thing i could do with my life is end it.im extremely pessimistic and increasingly misanthropic. i have yet to find a public space where i feel comfortable and welcome. i just sit in the library or in the corner of a bookstore just so i can have access to free wifi and even then i find nothing of interest. im lost and drowning. i just lack the courage to take the steps to kill myself.im miserable, angry, tired, bored, lonely, and listless. nothing seems to help. everything is just a distraction. i really dont know what to think and i doubt anything or anyone can really help.",2017-09-16 22:34:15,ViscoInferno,1

9w7pi4,i finally got into therapy.,Anxiety,"just what the title says. i got into therapy, while it was mostly for my depression. i still think that it helped with my anxiety though. i would like to think that it did. anyways, the therapist talked about how i was feeling and we didnt really talk much about what is going through my mind. we just talked about why or how i do what i do. so the first session with her didnt go the way i thought it would go. i dont think that it would ever actually help me but i will still go to try to help me.she was for depression and not really anxiety but i think that she could still help me with anxiety and help men suppress it. i started taking a higher dosage of my anxiety medicine too. i think that it did make a big difference and i dont actually know if i like it. ive gotten so used to being the way i was i think that i just want to be that way forever. i dont like being happy, i dont like actually living my life. i dont know why i feel this way but i think that i was just meant to be the way i was. i think that i was genuinely happy yesterday (11-10-18) because it was my birthday and i spent it with people that i loved. i also got something that ive really been wanting for a long time. that was the macbook pro. i am typing this right now on it and i really enjoy it so far. i also went to a hockey game with my best friend and my mother. my mother sat somewhere else and my best friend and i both sat next to each other. it was a really fun time and i hope that my friend and i can do more things like that in the future. i guess thats it for now, i dont have anything else i could talk about, soooo.thanks for reading.",2018-11-11 23:34:02,nevillpapermen,1
9ty42y,an update (replies welcome!),Anxiety,"hello everyone, i recently made a post on this subreddit a bit ago [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety/comments/9rgg6f/it_is_taking_over_my_life/). from that post, i will go over things that have happened differently or things that happened at all. ive started a job and today was a rough day for many reasons. i will try to list as many as i can. * today, this person that i have never worked with before worked with me today. she seems a bit aggressive and since im still new, i dont know how to handle things like that. my friend and co-worker told me something from across the room and i couldnt hear him, i asked him to say it again and the person i met today yelled at me ""nevermind!"" (she wasnt even in the conversation anyway)* my friend is going through some very very hard things right now and i am personally very scared for her safety. she was trying to cut for the first time last night when i was asleep. i feel so bad for not being awake at the time to even try to help her. her sister and i both cut so maybe she got the idea from us. (some background, me - 14, sister - 17, friend - 15) i felt so scared that she wasnt responding even though she was just asleep. i was breathing hard and shaking at work when i had nothing to do. i felt so pressured as well.* the company i work at (small little sandwich shop) has a jacket that i can wear if i get cold. i only wear it to cover up my arm because i dont want people to see my cuts. i had to wash the dishes and my boss said that i have to take off the jacket. i told her that my cat scratched me. she told me to show her and i did (it was one cut on the top of my arm, all the other cuts are on the other side of my arm). she asked me if i was okay and how im doing. i felt embarrassed but also comforted because she cares about me a lot. * i forgot to take my anxiety medicine today so it just hasnt been the best. i wish that i did this morning because today probably would have gone better. that is it from today at work, nothing else happened. if you did decide to go and read the other post i did, i did mention that i wanted to cut myself. and yes, i did mention that i do in this post. i found some sharp blades from a little handheld knife. the first time i cut i did not go very deep, just a few little scratches. i was clean for 2 days before i did it last night because life just has really gone horribly for me the past months. life just is not that good for me right now. i also mentioned that i was going to get a therapist and that was supposed to happen about a week ago. my mom is in new orleans with her friends (again, if you read the other post, i said that she goes out with them a lot and it has made my life not great). last weekend, when i did start to cut, she was gone and i couldnt talk to her, i didnt have the friends i talk to now whenever i want to cut. they do support me when i want to cut and they always at least try to convince me to not cut. it only works sometimes. most of the time, it doesnt work and i still end up cutting.i ate dinner last night. i went out with my friends to target and got a stomach ache. that is the very reason why i dont eat dinner, i get stomach aches whenever i eat dinner. i hate it so much. we were having such a good time then i just randomly got a stomach ache and kinda ruined my night. but it did eventually go away and my friends did make me feel better. something completely different from what i was saying, but i realized that i hate myself. i hate that i need so much attention and reassurance. i hate that i need to take medicine for something that so many people in the world dont even have to worry about (ironic). i hate that i cut myself when there are obviously so many other better ways to deal with depression. i hate that so many things about my self. so many things!! i dont know how i will deal with my pain or if i will even deal with it at all. i might just cut myself for the rest of my life. p.s i think im getting a higher dosage for my anxiety medicine and im pretty happy about that. &#x200b;thanks for reading <3",2018-11-03 23:59:36,nevillpapermen,1
9rgg6f,it is taking over my life.,Anxiety,"hello everyone, this will be my first post to this sub.lets start off with the important things. i am a 14 year freshman. i dont have many people that i can trust with anything. most people i try to trust either go behind my back and tell private things that i told to them to other people who can hurt me and make me feel disgusting. i know that i should not worry about these people but i still stress over them anyways. &#x200b;these people that i cant trust were either my friends at one point or just for a day before i realized they are fake people just trying to use me. people that seem nice at first, they seem like they would be great people that are actually nice, but in reality, they are just sick people just using me. i am not the most popular person in school, nor do i try to be. i do know popular kids and people such as that but i have realized that they are just rich assholes who just arent good people. ive always thought of myself as a good person, ive never tried to make someone feel bad just because of what they did to me. ive been hurt so much before and so badly that i dont want even the worst person at school to go through it. i always try to be nice to everyone, to go out of my way to help someone. i never ever want to hurt anyone, no matter what they did to me.&#x200b;recently, my anxiety has started to take over my life. i have lost 35 pounds because i havent been eating breakfast or dinner. i can now see my ribs when i take my shirt off. every single day of my life i wake up, get out of bed, get dressed, go downstairs and wait for my sister to drive me to school (she goes to the same school, shes a senior). my first hour class i usually have earbuds in, with my head down on my desk because i literally have no energy to hold my head up. my 3rd hour class is even worse. i sometimes lay on 2-3 chairs fully extended just laying there with no energy. i feel so dizzy and so disgusting that ive started to hate life. ive always loved it and thought that i was fine. but not since recently. i feel so dizzy sometimes that i cant even stand up. i almost fell in the shower because i tried to pick up a shampoo bottle and toppled over.&#x200b;anxiety runs in the family and my mom, sister, and i, all take things for it. i feel like i have it the worst though. my sister and i both take fluoxetine. though, i take 30 mg and she takes only 10 mg. this has helped me a lot actually but i still think that i need a higher dosage. ive talked to my mom about it and she says to wait about a week or so for it to ""kick in"" before we go in to get a higher dosage. &#x200b;i think ever since today, did i really know that i am also just depressed and anxious all the time. i think this because i got home today, went into my draw and got my razor for shaving out. i started to scratch my wrist up. it didnt bleed a lot but never before this day have i really wanted to harm myself. i dont have any blades in my house that i can cut myself with really. this is a very good thing because i know that this will just escalate into something way bigger. there is still this thought in my mind that i want to get a blade and try again, and go deeper and draw more blood. i just want to feel something again. i told my mom that i tried to cut myself and we had this long text message about it. she goes out with her friends every weekend it seems like. she always says ""im a grownup, i can do what i want"" yeah i understand that but why cant she just be at home with her family? why cant she just realize that im depressed and anxious because shes always gone every weekend? i get so many stomach pains and body pains that i cant take it anymore. today, me and her talked about getting a therapist . weve talked about getting one for a while now but shes been busy at work and she couldnt call the office to book an appointment. she called today and texted me (before i told her that i cut myself) that i have an appointment on monday. ive never actually been more happier, i hope that i actually get professional help with my case of anxiety. i will update you all on that when the time comes. &#x200b;thank you for reading <3&#x200b;&#x200b;&#x200b;",2018-10-26 04:41:26,nevillpapermen,1

followed by a diagnosis of depression later. i took my initial trip to a psychiatrist when i was suffering from major brain fog. adhd really made sense to me — i was always distracted, impulsive, and wanted to do everything, but never really got around to doing anything. still did well in school though, and many people close to me told me they never would’ve guessed it. got prescribed with 10mg adderall xr, felt better for a bit and didn’t really feel any type of comedown at all. but there were many days i couldn’t get myself started on things due to a lack of motivation. i brought up these concerns to my psychiatrist and he suggested that i had depression, then prescribed 150mg wellbutrin xl to me and also upped my adderall xr dosage to 20mg. the first two weeks were awful; i got  anxiety, and started dwelling on my physical and mental situation, like bowel issues and itching i had ‘down there’ and especially my mental issues and trying to figure out if it was adhd, depression, anxiety or some combination of those making me feel this way. i wanted to cry all the time, never ate and found it hard to construct simple thoughts when interacting with people. these things caused many problems for me, especially at work, where i have to interact with a lot of people, like coworkers and guests. typically, i’m an outgoing person, but i isolated myself from my friends. we usually poked fun at each other, but i couldn’t handle the jokes and wanted to burst into tears whenever they said something even slightly insulting. it got to the point where i had to call out of work because i woke up feeling like complete shit and couldn’t stop crying. i stopped being productive altogether; i’m a computer science major and i would buy books and force myself to read or code, and would usually start but end up getting distracted, but i couldn’t even bring myself to start anything. i’m typically a shopaholic (because of the dopamine i guess?) and love going out with friends and spending wild amounts of money, but i feel like the joy has been sucked out of that too (good for my bank account, but makes my depression more noticeable). nowadays, i’m just so fixated on all of my issues that give me anxiety. i even ended up spending 4 hours writing a 3000+ word note to my psychiatrist about my issues, but he won’t get to that until the appointment.now i’m about 3 weeks into this medication. a lot of the side effects subsided, and my appetite is actually higher than before and i find myself overeating. i stopped crying and i can joke with my friends, but they tell me they have definitely seen a change and i don’t seem as happy anymore. i still can’t bring myself to do anything unless it’s necessary (aka whenever i have to work), and in this case i seem perfectly fine on the outside, even though i’m plagued with anxious thoughts constantly. on my days off, it’s a struggle to get out of bed, let alone do anything else. i don’t pay attention to my personal hygiene and go without showering and even though i feel disgusting, it’s like i physically can’t get myself to do it. i can sleep for over 10 hours and still feel very low energy, even with the adderall and wellbutrin. i don’t find it hard to sleep at all, i can nap a few hours after taking my medication without any struggles. i just feel useless because i’m not getting anything done, when i should be working on improving myself and working on college applications, but i can’t bring myself to do anything but dwell on my issues, and overanalyzing every symptom i show. i’m even overanalyzing that fact— have i always felt anxious and i’m only now noticing because the medication is helping me sort my thoughts out or is it a direct cause of the medications?i realized my depression is in full-swing today when i felt sadness even when i definitely should’ve been happy. i got the confirmation that i was accepted at a job that’s much better than my current one and is relevant to my major. i got the details for a weeklong program i applied for, which is relevant to my academic goals, that i’m leaving for this week where my travel is reimbursed completely. i got a call from the doctor after getting my blood tested for stds saying that everything is normal after having unprotected sex with multiple guys a few months ago (and i’m not sure if it’s impulsiveness or mania that caused this but now my sex drive is lower than ever). so why do i still feel this way?i’m thinking it’s the wellbutrin, as i have taken a higher dose of adderall recreationally, 30mg ir vs 20mg xr (which i know is bad but it was very occasional and that’s in the past) and felt completely fine, with no comedown and more productivity. i’ve been texting my psychiatrist but he hasn’t been responding after he told me to just wait it out. i’m going on a trip for a week starting next sunday and i’m going to be surrounded by people i don’t know, and i don’t know if i can interact with people without that extra push from a friend i usually have, especially because i’ve been isolating myself from those i’m comfortable with. i need to be focused for this because a lot of learning is involved, but i don’t know if i can bring myself to have the right mindset before then. i haven’t even started packing yet, and i’m most likely working all day on friday and saturday, so tomorrow is the only day i have, and i hope i have the energy to get out of bed before 3pm.my next appointment isn’t until the 16th and i don’t know how i’ll cope until then. what should i suggest to my psychiatrist? upping the dosage? trying brand name instead of generic? trying a different antidepressant? trying out beta blockers or benzos? i also want to increase my adderall dosage, but i don’t want to get the effects confused because of multiple changes in my medications at once.i feel like i went off on tangents and i wonder if anyone can help me out with this. after writing all this i feel like i’m just complaining about small issues that i’m making a big deal out of and can easily fix if i tried a little harder. but i guess i feel better because i got all of this off my chest. i’ve told many people i suffer from adhd, anxiety and depression, but i don’t think people realize the emotional toll it takes on me or my daily inner conflicts because i have never gone into this much detail to anyone but my psychiatrist. i’m just really confused and don’t even know what answers i’m searching for, but maybe there’s someone out there who can make sense of my rambling. i know these are all issues i need to bring up with my doctor, but until then i think hearing other people’s thoughts on my situation will make me feel better.",2019-01-03 08:49:34,m33kup,1
ac2ttb,venting about my love life,depression,"so it’s 1:00 am and i just really feel like venting right now, so here goes. it’s probably gonna be a bumpy road so here goes.so about 6 years ago i moved houses, and we live there for about a half a year until we meet our neighbors. my family consists of me, my mom, my dad, and my sister. the neighbors family was a girl my age, a girl my sisters age, and their mom. their dad had died a couple years before we met them. so me and the girl my age were super good friends and my sister and the girl her age were super good friends. we hung out a lot. about 3 months into our friendship i admitted my feelings to her. now since i was in the 5th grade i didn’t really know what i was doing and i’m super insecure and shy and introverted. so i never asked how she felt about me. she did like me at the time though. so fast forward a year. we are very good friends, we didn’t go to the same school but we hung out every day and the summers they practically lived at our house. and finally in 7th grade we started dating. now it wasn’t real dating, we just said we were. no one knew except us. the first time we held hands was when we were beside each other on the couch, we were both under a blanket and i scooched my pinky finger onto hers and they intertwined. then we would move each finger towards one another until our hands were completely held. now 7th grade me did not just love her but was in love with her. now after three weeks of dating she broke up with me, i was devastated. but i couldn’t tell anyone how much i was hurting because know one knew we were dating. we still hung out and then a couple weeks later she asks if i wanted to date again. being very dumb and inexperienced i said yes. we date for a week and then break up. then we get back together, now this time i was at the beach with my family and she breaks up with me over text. i’m at the pool and my mom is in the hotel room with my phone, so she’s sees the text and when i get back from the pool i get confronted about it. so now i’m devastated that she broke up with me and that my parents found out. so i get back from the beach she asks me again if i wanted to date, so at this point i had had enough, i told her that i couldn’t be in a relationship with someone that did those things to me. she gets mad and stops hanging out with me. so 8th grade year we never see each other. and for highschool we were supposed to go to the same highschool but then over the summer she transfers highschool a long with her sister. so i never see her anymore except for the occasional restaurants i see her at. i know i shouldn’t love her but i do, and i don’t know why. i’m so stupid for it and i just can’t stop it, she obviously doesn’t want a thing to do with me and that really hurts me.so thanks for hearing me vent if you made it this far thank you for sticking it out",2019-01-03 08:18:01,DarkPenguin0,1
9uw8ly,i don’t want to have kids,depression,"the title might be misleading because it’s not what it sounds like. i really want kids, it means that i’ve found love with someone and they love me back. but i have this condition with me, it’s called charcot marie tooth, basically it affects my feet and makes me have really high arches. it could dis able my later in life to the point i would need a wheelchair and my hands could go permanently numb (i’ll have to have surgery) right now (i’m 15) the symptoms are very mild, very high arches and just some pain in my feet. i got lucky because some kids are born not being able to walk and having issues with their brain. so back to the not wanting to have kids, the condition is hereditary. so if i have a kid with someone that is a holder of it but is not affected by it the child with 100% have it, and if i have a kid with someone that is not a holder of it, 50% chance of the kid having it. i don’t know what symptoms the kid will have and i know it sounds selfish but i don’t want my kid to be messed up, i want him/her to be normal and live a normal life where they don’t get made fun of at school for using a wheelchair or something like that. i’m really depressed thinking about how i could be the reason for my child’s suffering and it makes me not want to have kids but i really want them. i don’t know what to do ",2018-11-07 06:37:27,DarkPenguin0,1

i felt so warmed by all of my family that moment. it was a rough time for everybody, but we united. i remember every night sleeping in the same room with my mom and my little brother. i felt protected. our grandparents really helped us financially (and still do, as they paid mine and my brother’s college). but, in 2003, my mom met my stepfather, and, from there, things just became worse and worse.  i had no problems with him for the next 2 years. i kinda liked him. he was not my father, but i liked him. we used to play soccer games together in the ps2. but after some time his attitude changed. he became more… explosive?i was becoming a teenager and i always had something of a dark humor (not the racist/mysoginist/homophobic shit, but still dark humor). one day, he almost broke up with my mom after i made a joke calling him poor (he always had this strange money obsession, he really thinks he is rich, but we are just middle class). as a kid i was really confused with all of that, but that escalated. one day, going to the beach for the weekend, i got spanked in the car by my mom as my stepfather cheered it while driving. the motive was another joke that i made, about my stepfather shitting his pants (yeah he used to do that and leave the shitty underwear behind the bathroom door). that day was too much, too much for me and still terrifies me when i remember. i had never got beaten until that day. my cousin and my brother were in the car too. nobody did nothing to stop that.from that day on, my relationship with my mom went in a downward spiral of beating and shouting. for anything. the result? bad grades, isolation, tries with tobacco, alcohol and marijuana (at 13, 14 and 15yo respectivelly)... the whole family structure tumbled down. even today, i can’t communicate properly with my mom since i evolved a serious blockage. i don’t speak to my stepfather for more than 10 years, even living under the same roof. and it fucking messes with me.but, besides the experimentations with drugs and stuff, my teenage years were kinda normal. out of my house, i was a pretty confident person. i still had many friends (maybe not the best guys, but still friends), i had 3 girlfriends between 2008 and 2011, doing good enough to enter the journalism university… life was going on but, still, something was growing inside of me.my university didn’t helped a lot. i didn’t made any friends. it was not a campus, but just a cold, grey, boring building just downtown (still, academically, one of the best journalism colleges here in brazil). but after that, i got a freelance job at one of the biggest newspapers here in my state, so i thought the objective was accomplished.but i couldn’t avoid the troubles in my house, that kept going. so, in my time with my friends, i was really into drugs and alcohol and i spent several years in this. i feel like it was a time bomb, and, one day… boom. my first panic attack. it was a time that i was into cocaine and using it pretty much, every week. after that, i haven’t touched any synthetic drugs, even though i’m still pretty addicted to marijuana. one month after, i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. things were never the same.i got treatment, i got therapy, i had medicine, i tried to exercise, i tried to stop smoking pot and cigarettes. i tried pretty much what people tell us to do, but i failed in everything. from then on, every shit that happened to me seemed to hurt like 10x more. i broke up with a lot of people since then. even with all of this, i always tried to help my friends, all of them have similar problems, one of them even told me i saved his live with support during a anxiety attack. but i feel like nobody give a fuck about me. nobody ask how am i doing. nothing. not even a message.i got dispensed from my job after disagreements with my toxic disgusting fucking boss. and, last year, i decided to take my money and make my first travel outside the country, just by myself. surprisingly, in the middle of the darkness, i had the most legitimate moment of happiness i ever had. i spent 1 month around the coast of california. the 3 weeks i had in san diego were just magical. i met so many wonderful people and felt so welcomed. but, as it ended and i found myself in my mediocre life again, my happiness ended also.it has been rough, rough times. in the last 19 months i lost everything. at least, the little i still had. i broke up with basically all of my friends. i lost confidence. i feel like i can’t get outside my bedroom without being anxious. i’m terrified by panic attacks. i started to fear life and the outside world. i lost all interest in hobbies i once had. i lost my family because, in my head, my stepfather stole it from me. i lost the job i still had because of depression. i lost faith. i lost hope. the past weeks i reached the bottom.last days i cried so many times, but it’s a weird, slow crying. i feel so much angst but i just drop like 2 tears at a time. after some minutes, it starts again, and i drop 2 more. and it goes on and on. always in my bed, with a pillow covering my face. i feel a severe lack of energy, that prevents me from doing the more trivial and stupid shit, like playing games. i just feel hazed and numb.i could try a new life somewhere, maybe in san diego, the only place i felt genuinely happy, but it still so hard. i feel like this is for strong and independent people and i’m not one of them. mostly because i’m afraid of having panic attacks in a place that i can’t afford medical care and stuff. if i’m in a moment when going outside my bedroom and showering are a martydom, i just can’t imagine living outside the country by myself.now i’m thinking about the future and i just feel adrift. with nowhere to go and no dreams besides getting out of this fucking agonizing situation. but there’s no much hope left, it maybe just get worse. my stepfather and my mom are going to spend their triumphal holidays in europe. my brother is going to the beach with friends. i have no friends. i will pass the holidays alone. it’s not something new to me, but i never felt more tended to end my own life, and the perspectives are also not good. from a plenty happy kid, to a problematic teenager, and then a fearful, disfunctional, angsty and suicidal adult. the more i live, the more i want to die.",2018-11-12 13:25:56,iferraz2,1

ac1wyd,looking for some advice for two people dealing with depression in a relationship.,depression,"i’ve struggled with depression and anxiety off and on since i was a kid, at one point i was put in a psyche ward for suicidal thoughts. was put in medication during early teens, weened off, been more or less healthy, up until a few years ago. reached early twenties, started drinking a bunch on nights out, really started to bring out some unwanted behavior. cooled out on the drinking, met my boyfriend, and have been with him for four years. he struggles with depression as well, but was refusing to get help, as he is one who likes to solve everything his own way. it caused issues for us, and ultimately after an episode of his, i made the decision to leave. we were broken up for just short of two months, still talking everyday, his depression worsened and he had a small episode of suicidal thoughts. we agreed to get back together, he agreed to seek help, and we would rely on one another. cut to this past weekend...we celebrated our four year anniversary. it was amazing. we head to a new years party, had a few drinks, and i have no idea what the hell happened, but somehow i got in my head that he was making out with someone at the party (he wasn’t), and had even convinced myself that others around me had confirmed he had (they didn’t). ended new years with me crying under my friends table. woke up the next morning, had briefly forgotten what happened and then it hit me. i got so deep into an instant depressive state that my only thoughts were how i just couldn’t deal with the sadness anymore, that i had fucked up the relationship beyond repair, and the occasional thought of “ending it” popped in my head. now it wasn’t a “i’m gonna go and kill myself right now” thought. it was more of a hopeless, this an option because i can’t think of anything else. i told him, he was concerned and was comforting me, and i just felt humiliated. we talked today, and he said that he was more or less used to my drunken depressive episodes that i would occasionally have every couple of months, but that the revelation that i got so hopeless to the point of thinking of hurting myself...he said he was concerned whether or not staying together given the fact that we are both dealing with these mental health issues, was healthy for either of us. now i’ve stated that i’m done drinking. not an alcoholic, can go months without the stuff, but for whatever reason, every now and then when i partake...episode. i already schedule a therapist visit. just absolutely terrified right now of losing him to this illness. i want to be there and be strong for him, as well as myself. i think we can work through this together, which i told him, and he agreed to try. but i feel so defeated.

ac1w4v,music boxes makes me cry,depression,"i cry over the simplest of things. i cry over everything. i only have 2 years left until i’m on my own. i don’t want that. i pray every night. i wish i had someone. someone to be there for me. someone that truly loves me. well, true love is just a joke right? i used to think that. my favorite type of music is anything emotional. music boxes are cool. every time i see or hear the word, look up images of it or see the figure in real life, hear the sounds it makes, i bursts into tears for no reason. and yes, i am crying as i’m typing this. i don’t want to die. i do not wish that nor do i not wish for any of you to die. i sometimes can be careless... or ruthless. i feel like there’s two sides or multiple sides of me. this is who i am now i guess...update: i used to be very happy as a child. i love the outdoors. now i’m just sitting here being lazy. i do love to write. but freely. i cry over nostalgia, things that i used to own or still have today. i get bad memories. all the good memories don’t last. depression used to consume me severely and still does but not as bad. anxiety is what kills me today. i love the things i do as a child like going to the park and play in the playground. going on the swing set. gosh i’m making myself cry even more. i know there’s at least one person that cares about me. parents or family doesn’t count. i fantasize a lot. like a lot. i daydream to the point where my focus is lost. i can’t pay attention in class making me feel like i’m disabled in someway. i always say i will see a therapist, but never did or will. i self diagnose myself way too much to the point where it’s getting too far and annoying. i keep saying i have severe depression and anxiety or ocd, but no way to confirm until i get checked out. but i can tell that i do have it and pretty badly. you can downvote or hate me how much you want. i’m filled and fueled with and by hated, and violence.update 2: everyone knows i’m born from hellfire. i can’t be and will never be loved and cared by others. i always contradict myself. i keep having fictional character crushes. i’m afraid i’ll never find love. i’m afraid i’ll be lonely and single forever.update 3: nobody understands me.",2019-01-03 06:23:49,KoolNerdz,0

9mlv0q,i think i may have bpd,mentalhealth,"ive shown slight symptoms of borderline personality disorder from a very young age but something just happened to me and now i have more of the symptoms and they are more apparent to me. when was in kindergarten i never wanted to talk to people. if i wanted something or needed to use the restroom or get a drink i wouldnt say anything. id just sit there in agony until i got home. if someone did something i didnt like i would punch or kick them. i went to therapy for anger issues in 4th grade. it took me a good while to understand that that behavior isnt ok. i did have some friends, but they were always the first to approach me and wouldnt talk to them usually. id just hang out near them if i needed to have partner for an assignment. ive always been in the background by myself watching other people, usually i picked specific people that i thought were interesting. once i got into middle school i secretly wanted to talk to them and have friends, but i never did. im too scared to just talk to people, plus im scared about the future of the relationship afterwards.currently some of the social aspects have gotten better others havent. i still wont leave class to use the restroom even if that means i have to sit through an hour and a half of a bladder thats just about to burst. i still sit in background and watch others but if someone talks to me i dont completely ignore them anymore in hopes that they may talk to me again. if someone does something to me i dont like i feel more mildly inconvenienced than anything else and i usually forgive them if they stop doing it as compared to punching them. the other thing i noticed is that i recently went to a hayride/haunted house and when the monsters touched me it actually felt good because im so lonely.alrighty, so now to even more recent stuff. there was i girl i had a crush on for 4 years. i imagined fake scenarios in my head and i made a fake relationship over those 4 years. it was one of the main things that kept me happy. i wanted to talk to her this year but i didnt know how to talk to people so i just stared at her until she noticed. she thought i was creepy so she told me to leave her alone. the version of her that was in my head immediatly died after that. after that is when the symptoms really came out. i never could understand why someone would kill themselves before this. the day this happened i decided i wanted to run away to iowa. i didnt even think about it, i just left. 4 hours later i had made it 30+ miles away on my bike into a bad neighborhood in the cities. i was hoping someone would just kill me or that i would freeze to death. i got pretty cold and my dad was freaking out constantly texting me for half an hour so i decided to finally just let him pick me up. i kinda regret that, i wish i would have just froze. at school ive now been talking pictures of celebrities faces(danny devito), putting a piece of tape on the back, and slapping it on someones face or back and then running away. ive never done anything like this before in my life. ive been doing it because it makes me happy. some of the kids laugh and seeing someone else being happy makes me happy. yeah, it sucks for the person getting their face slapped but in the end theres more happy people than sad people. i dont think anyone really likes me anymore which has caused my social anxiety to go away partly because now i have nothing to lose with them. unless i come across a new group of people. then it comes back and i revert into living statue mode.tl;dr: ive been kinda antisocial since i was younger and i had some anger issues. now something happened to me and im not like myself anymore. i go through the day being either kinda happy or extremely depressed. ive been acting out a lot too. i used to just find a place to sit down and then id turn into a statue. now i go around and cause trouble. i dont even think before i do anything bad and i used to be a slightly crappy goody two shoes.what i think would fix my issue is having friends to hang out with. im not really sure though because ive never done that before.",2018-10-09 06:46:09,Lumelore_,0

ac0nij,"losing myself, bit by bit over the past 3 months...",depression,"i knew myself from the beginning that i am sort of an unlucky person when it comes to finances or capital gain. yet, i can give ridiculous tips that worked out well for others, but never for myself. 3 months ago, i was at a crappy work place but filled with great colleagues who then became friends. here, i didnt have anything to worry as everything was done as a team. we joked and talked throughout the entire day, and still get the work done to the envy of other teams.as i needed to further my career, i then moved to a new workplace a month later, with a better salary, having spent at least 5 years at my previous job. however, that turned out to be one of the horrible decision i made in life. filled with depressing work scope, and colleagues who do not communicate much other than using a headphone from 9am-6pm, it made me isolate myself to a place i never felt comfortable. i have no one to channel my guilt or feelings other than my girlfriend and close friends.two of my close friends are married and settled down, both of whom are quite well to do. i considered myself as a failure when compared to any of the two. one of them works in a big industry and has no intention to leave as he brings back roughly 6 figures yearly for the past 5-6 years. ever since then, he has been interested in passive income and does trading. recently, he introduced trading via an expert advisor and his own methodology to which he has been consistently profiting around $2k a month with the initial capital of $5k.it may not sound much but his philosophy is to withdraw the capital and trade using the profits, and does that for quite a while, prolly close to 10 years. he has other friends and members of their family who trades as little as $500 or as much as $10k and their returns were consistent. knowing the game plan was not to get rich but more of generating passive income without much capital, as well as having much faith in him and his methods, i placed myself $2k and made about $1k over two months (ups and downs).you may call it naive or any other synonym but i took the plunge and added in an additional $8k last week hoping to at least maintain or generate a tidy amount of profit with a much more minimal draw-down. this was done after a thorough review of demo accounts and months of deliberation (even before i had placed the initial $2k). thus, any profits made, regardless how small it is, i was hoping to withdraw it on a monthly basis for my marriage and house fund. however, today, due to the flash crash of the market, both my accounts and the profit were wiped out. all gone within an hour.i dont take much solace in knowing that the market affected others as well. ironically, my friends account wasnt affected as he didnt turn it on. and the other, had a close shave as he withdrew his profits of about $6k. nonetheless, he still lost around $4k profits of his entire account earlier. i dont know if this sadness is causing depression or will lead to one. or if channeling my loss to my friends ""saved account"" is right. moreover, the funds i had saved for a considerable time, for a wedding in about 18 months is gone. the capital, and profit made were just erased in a few hours. now, i am in office, clocking in hours hoping to recover what i had planned for.ive read or seen stories where a gambler gambles most of his capital in a bid to recoup what was lost, only to lose everything. i still have that much sanity to know that is not the solution but i do not have much to move forward, or face the world over my failures. my girlfriend told me to chin up and everything will be alright, but i do not have the courage to move on. my world just came crashing down in the space of 3 months, and i really feel out of place...",2019-01-03 04:07:22,goblingong,1

abzrwq,"not seeking medical advice, just am curious what antidepressants have worked for you and why? also, which meds you have taken that have given you the least amount of side effects.",depression,"hi all,i have seasonal depression and major depressive disorder that runs in my family. all of the women in my family seem to have one or the other to some degree and i was “lucky” enough to inherit it as well. i am 28 and have been consciously dealing with bouts of depression since i was 16. it took me till i was 21 to religiously take medication to try to help with it. i am lucky (no sarcasm this time!) because i can sense/feel when my depression is coming on. i can feel that i’m getting down, i notice the symptoms and normally with the medication i am on i could successfully push it away and move forward and i lost this most recent battle and am trying my hardest to get my depression at bay right now. two years ago i was started on effexor xr at 75mg. it worked great for about a year until i noticed my symptoms were getting unavoidable again. my doctor upped me to 150mg of effexor xr and here i am again, a year later, in a bad place. effexor xr really seemed to have the least amount of side effects compared to some other meds i have tried (besides excessive sweating when i am anxious, which i hate because it’s very excessive). i had tried effexor xr back when i was 19 but didn’t stay on it because young-me hated to take a pill every day and i felt like it wasn’t working. i have tried wellbutrin which a lot of people seem to have success with but within the first two weeks i was on it, it made me very snappy and have a 0-100 temper which i never have had before in my life. i am a very patient person. my ears also rang a lot. i was also on zoloft before effexor but stopped taking that as it seemed to have plateaued. i was on it from the time i was 20-25. i am currently under medical care and am hoping to get in to see my doctor asap to switch my meds. it seems like i get side effects pretty badly no matter what type of medication i take (whether it be antibiotics or antidepressants) so i would like to try to avoid ones with extreme side effects as i may likely experience them. the ones i am trying to avoid most are weight gain and sexual side effects. i haven’t experienced sexual side effects on any of the medications i have taken and pray that it stays that way. weight gain i just want to avoid since i have gained weight from stress eating on my own accord and don’t want to add to it. the current effects i am having from my depression are fatigue, constant negative thoughts i can’t shake, disinterest, lack of motivation. so any medications notorious for increasing those may be a no-go as well. i feel like i’m hopeless at this point and just want to feel better. i am curious if anyone has had success with wellbutrin after a rocky beginning? i stopped taking it under the advice of my doctor because of how horrible my temper was and edgy i felt and i’m wondering if i gave it a fair chance but wouldn’t want to try it again if it likely won’t get better in the long run. does anyone have any success stories or unsuccessful stories? i like to know a little about what i’m delving into beforehand. thank you so much for your time. 💗",2019-01-03 02:31:37,all_of_the_kitties,1

9yl88t,does talking online help for you?,depression,"what i mean by this is: talking to someone in one of those little online help chatrooms. i literally have no one to comfortably vent to and it gets really lonely and frustrating. i have a therapist, but i get the consistent feeling that shes really judgemental. also, our personalities dont gel at all. i am not really in a position to go and look for yet another one, though.for example: shes constantly putting the blame of me getting hurt by insensitive comments about my sexuality on me. because when my family generalizes about lesbians, its not an attack on me personally. she recently told me her sister is a lesbian and that really shocked me, seeing as she seems to have almost no empathy when it comes to that situation with me. i also told her i couldnt finish a story due to a personal crisis. she made light of it, saying: ""personal crisis,"" with a chuckle. she also knows about the crisis referred here and i dont get why she would then laugh at it. when she talks about past failures of mine, she seems to always chuckle or smile, which i personally find really fishy and strange. she also comments on my diet(keto) frequently, saying its unhealthy and then treats me like a dumb kid, who doesnt know about nutrition. keto works for me and i dont really think its the business of a therapist to meddle that much in your intake of certain foods, unless you get extremely fat or thin. occasionally shell have good tips, but i often just leave her practice feeling worse about myself.anyway, that turned into a rant about my therapist and im sorry. i guess i just really crave someone who listens and doesnt judge. im kinda fed up looking for friends on here, cause they often end up ghosting me, making me feel even worse about myself.",2018-11-19 23:33:58,dreamerinthesky,1

90dwqh,finally stood up to my mom and i finally am alive.,offmychest,"its weird how something whose concept was the basis for my underlying neuroses and fears is actually the best thing to happen to me in a while. for the past 2-3 years id always have this anxiety that i would be kicked out of my home and left for the wolves so to speak. on the surface my family seems fine but its really fucked. my mother is mentally ill (i think some form of bipolar or bpd) on top of just having an extreme victim complex and sense of entitlement. shes very controlling and manipulative and just straight up abusive (hitting, gaslighting, micromanaging, incomprehensible logic and lectures). i would get belted over random bullshit until i was 18 and became this 61 200lb dude. my dad would enable it under the excuse of ""keeping the peace"" and that i just need to think positive and have a better attitude even though my mom treats him like shit. even my dad angrily rants to me and it sounds like the the wet dreams of r/relationships and r/deadbedrooms. she spent most of her 30s shopping compulsively on amazon and day drinking by herself while my dad and i had school or work. she was effectively a neet. last year and a half she finally got an actual job through my dad burning a couple favors but recently lost it due to starting drama with her coworkers and saying shit to her bosss face. of course none of this was her fault. whenever i try and stand up she would get even crazier and threaten to disown me/kick me out.one of her ways of power tripping is making me do her share of housekeeping or random errands at random hours despite my current needs or schedule. i work fast food and construction so i can come back from a 10 hour day of digging ditches or doing compaction and she would make me wash a mountain of her dishes or pick up dog shit from the dogs she bought with my dads money behind his back. last night i came back from a long day of work and needed to nap for 30 minutes and my mom kept barging into my room and told me to wash her mountain of dishes for the umpteenth time. i told her id be more than happy to do it after some quick shut eye but she wouldnt relent. it eventually escalated to her threatening to calling the cops on me to kick me out of the house and something clicked within me. i didnt have a flight or fight response. i didnt react to any of her fighting words. just looked her in the eye and smugly told her to step it up then. after some hesitation she got her phone, put it on speaker, and called the 911. my mother had a very cringeworthy with the operator and made them visibly uncomfortable. she played the victim card and was like ""ive done everything i could for secretwasianman but hes been so disrespectful all these years i cant handle his rudeness can you have the police take him out of the house"" before going on a an incomprehensible rent where she claimed to be my godmother and that i was 21 (im actually 19). i just packed up my backpack, went to the front yard, took a refreshing nap on the lawn, and later went to my friends house where i have been for yesterday and today.  my dad and i had an honest conversation on the phone and he said he too has been extremely fed up with her and has slowly been learning how to implement boundaries, especially financially. he said ill be good to come back home tomorrow night.i feel like so much has been resolved, like i freed up years worth of emotional space. i use to cry and even self harm in these confrontations.  i repressed and agonized over my issues with my mother to the point where i had to be prescribed the maximum dosage for prozac. im numb and nothing in life feels real like ive been staring through a window pane on a deep level. but now that window has been opened a crack and i actually feel something aside from pervasive hurt and pain for the first time in ages. its like i stood up to a school bully but on a more intense level. im now at that friends house where were playing knights of the old republic and sampling $uicideboy$ songs till we pass out tonight. im not going to say life is good, but this is a nice inflection point.",2018-07-20 10:19:21,SecretWasianMan,1

8o5ki9,my dad is a suicidal manchild,depression,"my dad has never been the best dad. i remember a period where i really hated him and wanted to punch him and stuff. my parents have been separated for a while now, but my entire family lives together. my mom has been sleeping on the couch for almost 5 years. we even moved to a new continent almost two years ago. they fight everyday. frankly, i dont even understand this situation myself. it seems the more my dad ages, the more childish he gets. i am 19, and while i consider myself to still very much be a child, im more of an adult than him. he spends his days watching youtube, playing video games, and taking naps, and complaining about the littlest things. hes bipolar and is probably in the middle of a depressive episode at the moment, but hes like this even when hes not. he asks questions like ""do you think ive eaten enough"" and cant wash a spoon when he needs one. he always imagines the worst case scenario for everything. living with him is exhausting. hes like a leech, he sucks out the entire familys energy. since he and my mom fight a lot, he comes crying (a lot of the time literally) to me, saying that shes mean and all. he begs me to try to tell her to be nicest, basically treats me like a marriage therapist. i told him to stop, but he doesnt listen. hes made 3 suicide attempts in these past months. my mom at first dismissed him and even told him to go ahead and kill himself (shes just completely exhausted, which explains but does not justify her behavior), so he came and cried to me about it. it was very triggering to me, as i also have depression. ive had to call the ambulance on his first attempt because my mom was rather apathetic. his third attempt was the most serious, and i was home alone. i just went on autopilot and called an ambulance again. at the moment, hes still at the hospital. my mom was extremely upset with it since i had to see him laying in his blood and told me that he wouldnt set foot again in the house, which was relieving to me. ive been wanting for them to separate for very long. but i knew that it would most likely never happen. no matter how much my mom yells at my dad, shes still an enabler. she enables him to continue living the way he does. she buys his alcohol, works to keep the family afloat, probably gives him money so he can buy his weed, and cooks for him. i understand why she does it. otherwise he complains and its awful. but the problem is he knows he can get anything he wants. so my mom went from wanting to do nothing with him to visiting him at the hospital everyday and bringing him dinner because he doesnt want to eat the hospital food. she told him neither her, me, or my sister wanted him back in the house. he said hed try killing himself again if he didnt have us. i dont think this is blackmail. but hes already tried killing himself three times when he was with us (including one time we were hosting an exchange student). at this point, i dont know what to do anymore. i know hes in a lot of pain, but its not fair for us to have to deal with all this.

78bpuo,i don't like how my university is handling these things,depression,"last week we got two emails about student deaths. see, the thing about student deaths is that theyre never explained, whereas staff member deaths have clear details about what happened. student deaths are always ""they were found in their residence, causes unknown, police investigating"". student deaths emails often happen during deadline periods/exam period. this week, for my university, is the week you hand in a shit ton of essays. the deaths happened last week. its easy to make a connection, even more so when rumors about suicide float about. i dont like how my university is handling this. its swept under the rug, and thats disgusting. people out there are dying because they feel awful, and there are many other people who feel the same way but stay silent. student deaths emails are something you just scroll past and thats kinda crazy. why do they not try to raise awareness? just a simple email, every once in a while, telling us that theres this number you can reach, that you can talk to someone at the wellness centre... it would already make a difference. the wellness centre is also a problem because i had to wait for 4 months to hear back from them. 4 months!!!!either way, no one talks about student deaths. there was a guy in one of my classes who committed suicide, and i only knew because i searched for his name in my class lists. otherwise i wouldnt have known. and sure, there are so many of us, but its still crazy that this happens. but maybe im naive for thinking that a university should care about its students. idk, its just very sad to me.",2017-10-24 02:17:51,parentissuesta,1

aa91l5,so this is how i feel rn,depression,"you know when you are not “pretty” people don’t really care what you have to say now unless you bring something to the table and prove that you are worthy of their attention no one cares about you but if you are pretty you are instantly interesting and what you have to say matters and i’m not that’s 100% the case but talking in a general sense it’s fucking true! if you have the confidence and really and truly don’t care how you look and give that vibe then people will think whatever but for me i’m only human and if you give me a vibe that what i say doesn’t interest you i’m not gonna talk and i’m not gonna want to be around you and that’s everyone so i don’t want to be around anyone i don’t want to have to prove myself and show people i’m worthy of their time and attention and if i don’t then i’m not worthy of anyone and i don’t have much to offer people anyway i’m not interesting i haven’t accomplished anything i don’t have a talent or a hobby and i’m not smart so i really don’t know how to hold a conversation about anything so for no reason should i ever grab someone’s interested and so i will always fell unwanted or no one care if i’m there or not and you’re probably thinking why would u care if someone wants u there or if they don’t well i don’t if i wanted to be there but why should i be there if i’m not wanted why should i force myself and maybe you’ll say why is it forcing yourself and well if i’n not wanted there so i wouldn’t want to be there why would i be there ?  now you’re probably wondering what’s your point where is the ‘there’ i speak of, well my friend the ‘there’ is anywhere outside of my room l o l i don’t really wanna be anywhere because i already explained why so why should i leave my house and “live my life” if the meaning of living my life is to be outdoors making friends and socialising but doing that makes me feel like shit so why do it why should i live my life if i think it’s shit to do that i rather just stay in my room and watch videos a place where i don’t have to get close to people and they say some shitty shit thing that will make me feel like shit more then i already feel like shit for being alive in the first place and you’re probably thinking well you don’t know the right people and maybe there are people that are nice and will not make me feel like shit but where the fuck am i gonna find them i already made friends that i’m close to and i have settled for because i enjoy their company sometimes more then slot of other people’s but even they make me feel like shit and lately more then usual it’s just little things and i’m very sensitive to not feeling wanted somewhere so if someone was to say something slightly harsh that shit will cling on me like a motherfucker it will fuck my entire mood and that’s just how i am and i can’t help it i’ve been in many situations where i let my way of thinking get in the way of me being anywhere around people because i haven’t had the best experience with humans they suck ass even i do for that matter soo tbh i just hate the world and i don’t see the point of always living like this it’s a fucking miserable ass place like even if i think for the future and i think of having a husband and kids and then what what’s after that we just keep living until we die wtf i don’t want to live i don’t enjoy it i am uncomfortable living it’s a shit place i hate it i hate people i hate how they make me feel i hate myself i hate the shit i do i hate how i am i’m tried of it i’m tired of not being interesting or not being enough even for myself and if u tell me then change that i have tried time and time again but i can’t i don’t know how i’m stuck being this lazy insecure fucker who has nothing to offer the world i just live for absolutely no reason and i would end my life but i’m scared of the after life idk what’s to come i don’t really believe in everything i hear weather it religion science or a theory i will take in to consideration because no one fucking know so what if i kill myself what if the after life is even more shit then this naaaa yo i really can’t do anything worse then this and you’re probably thinking of how ungrateful i am and tell me there are people starving in africa and i say well that’s why point if you’re not happy with your life why can’t u just end it weather it’s a rich privilege fuck or a poor homeless person if you’re not happy you’re not happy it’s not really you’re circumstances that define your happiness it’s you mentality you can be poor with a lot of life struggles and live a positive life and then you can be like me and live a negative life and i know again you’re thinking stop being so ignorant and change that and you think if i could i wouldn’t of course i would but as i said it’s who i am how i became to be this is me and i am no happy with it so i’m with u on that fucking change it but i can’t i tired and i am still trying but i’m the same time i think wtf is the point what’s the end result? what do i get there’s millions of others like me struggling with themselves how do i snap out of it can i snap out of it what do i do i have tried what i know to talk myself out of it to isolate myself i’m never happy but i am must comfortable alone in a room i would love to live my life and enjoy it because my brain is definitely my worst enemy and i can’t escape it so where do i go if even death i’m scared of? where does someone like me belong and be as harsh and you fucking want because believe me i’ve already said it to myself (but actually don’t because i’m not doing so well rn unless u want your comment be a reason why someone ends their life then by all means you’re a just another shitty person in this shitty earth so it shouldn’t fuck with me too much) and if you made it this far even though you know i’m ugly or at least not “pretty” you is a different type of human so thanks for being that ",2018-12-28 12:01:37,hgigi11,1

a81vok,anyone try functional medicine?,mentalhealth,"i (38m) was recommended fm from my therapist to help see if there were biological reasons for my depression that also needed attention besides just talk therapy. blood work and brain map tests from a surface eeg and just got done going through results. blood work was not too bad from my understanding, need lots of vitamin d. my blood sugar looks average but because i do very high spikes and then lows which average out (lines up with my college style eating habits and sugar/soda habits). brain map showed that my awake state is near absolute bottom the chart. the explanation was surreal as the doc began to say “everything i see here is what we see often in engineering type brains. i imagine you have a hard time getting going, connecting with people, few friends. but when you get going you tend to have hyper focusing and can really be productive...”. he has known me for maybe 30 minutes total and was describing my entire existence was like and it was completely surreal. he recommended about 40 sessions of “brain training” to help get it functioning in ways that are more normal. i’ve always had this feeling that i had something severely wrong with my brain my entire life as i would often joke “i bet they find a brain tumor one day.” it was a very emotional thing to finally be shown something that, while not a tumor, could very well be the reason why i am the way i am. the doc made a comment “i think we can help you get your life back” and i lost it. i told him “back? this is all i have ever known. i can’t get back something i never had.” i always have felt like i did not experience the world the same as most everyone else. talk therapy has been helpful but the main goal has been to reframe how i think about a situation. but this is so much different. this is saying that my brain really does not function the same as most everyone else and needs to physically act differently before i can even start thinking about situations differently. i have tried anti-depressants in the past and they did next to nothing noticeable for me. i feel vindicated in many ways. i feel terrified that my entire existence, or at least how i experience life, could change (supposedly for the better). but it would be so different from what i know now that it scares me.

75pgeo,go private for cbt or waste of time?,Anxiety,"i waited on nhs for cbt therapy for ages last year, waited so long that by the point i got it i was suicidal shell of myself barely getting through a day. when i went for my 6 cbt sessions i honestly dont believe this was cbt, the woman just keep trying to hypnotise me and it made me feel so uncomfortable because i dont believe in hypnotism. i then felt i had to put on a big show to make her not feel bad about the hypnotism she keep trying to do on me. after the 6 weeks we hadnt talked about what i had asked help with, i wanted help with social anxiety along with  other things. each session we would end up talking about her fights with her husband, her past relationships and how people where mean to her at work and school. i felt like i was giving her therapy.once the six weeks came to an end i so wanted to never go back because i found it emotionally draining trying to talk to her about her problems and also pretend i was being hypnotised to spare her feelings. so i lied and told her i was much better and she made me fill in a form telling me what to write back how shed really helped me. now its about 6 months on and i am still no better, i wonder if this sounds like cbt to any of you guy who have had it, does it involve hypnotising ?  i really want some coping strategies and be able to move forward with my life. my negative voice tells me maybe i didnt try hard enough or wasnt open enough, i found the whole thing so emotionally draining and not uplifting.i have private medical care with work and i wondered if it sounds like if i got referred by my gp could i find someone better would i get actual cbt, from your experience should i get a better outcome? i dont want to put myself through the emotional exhaustion  and upheaval if its not going to benefit me, after seeing her id cry all night long and dread going to a session all week.the other thing im worried about is, will my work know i need to get cbt? id hate them to find out. i also am worried the gp wont give me a private referral or the other therapist will get in trouble if i said she didnt help me really.  summary:did i get cbt or a bad therapist?should i try again?what was your cbt experience like?will my work know if i get it via private medical care?

abwmik,am i depressed?,depression,"i am just so angry. its so unfair that all of my friends get to graduate college and have happy, healthy relationships, while im 23, in my second year at college, and too mentally ill (ocd) to find a relationship. and the verbal/emotional abuse i experienced from my dad when i was a kid did not help at all and wrecked my self-esteem.after i graduated high school at 18, i fell mentally ill. because of this, and that i changed majors several times, i spent four years fulfilling the requirements for my associates degree.when i got accepted to my university, i learned from them that my major (mechanical engineering) doesnt even require hardly any general ed classes. so, goodbye to four years of my life. i have to start the four years for their engineering program almost from scratch.i also have failed several courses there, setting me back another 1-2 semesters. i was originally going to be able to plan to graduate in spring of 2021, but i dont know if its going to happen by then. hell, i dont even know if it will happen at all, because i always get set back by some stupid thing in life.im not lazy; in fact, there was a brief period in my life (summer of 2015) where i was free from my ocd. i achieved this by working 45+ hours per week doing manual labor at a hand car wash. work is the only thing that makes me feel fulfilled. school makes me feel like i am not productive and it completely drags me down, creating a gaping void in my life, combined with the guilt of being a 23-year-old who is still dependent on his parents.sometimes it gets so bad that the very existence of women with stem degrees makes me feel worthless and emasculated. pregnant women make me feel emasculated (even though i dont want kids). theyre just a painful reminder that no woman is ever going to want to carry my child or feel that i am a worthy partner for it. i know that this is racist, but i feel the same about asian women [30+] in my area, because so many first-generation asian women tend to date asian men who are successful and make >$100,000 per year. none of them will date a white, career-less loser like me who doesnt have his shit together yet.i know this is cheesy, but i saw the new cinderella movie on netflix recently, and it made me really yearn to have a loving, fulfilling relationship like that. i can only hope that that is what my future holds.to top it all off, i developed dysphagia about two years ago. the doctors have been too stupid to figure out whats causing it, so i dealt with the problem by making myself fruit smoothies, which are easier to swallow. unfortunately, those are expensive, so i turned a $6,300 savings into a $1,300 credit card debt over 18 months. it turned into an eating disorder, where i would spend upwards of 6 hours per day shopping, making, or trying to eat, food. it left me with no time to read, play guitar, or do anything else fun. i remember i got to see cannibal corpse a year ago in concert. **even after i had bought my ticket, and even after the concert had started, i was still deliberating about whether or not i wanted to go.**i suspect that my dad has some sort of autism/aspergers, and i have zero sympathy for him. he would always bully and criticize me as a kid, all the while bragging to his friends about how awesome i am. he hates himself, and used me as a vessel to build his self-esteem. it made me extremely sensitive to anything he said to me. and ill bet you can imagine how it made me feel when he constantly fear-mongered to me about how my college fund might run out and how i will have to take out a loan, or that i will need to pay for my own health insurance once i turn 26 (as per the affordable care act). of course, this is possible, im not trying to cop-out or say that i shouldnt do this, but all of these problems make me not want to continue. success does not await me, it will simply be indefinitely pushed back.everything gives me anxiety now. i never wake up eager to start my day. i always wonder how long its going to take me to start being productive in a day, or how badly i will fail. because sunsets are so beautiful where i live, they give me existential anxiety. like a sunset, life is very beautiful but very short, and if i am not living it to the fullest, 100% of the time, i am wasting it and it is such a horrible thing.i dont have the will to kill myself. i am too invested in the arbitrary possibility of finding love and reaching a point in my life (when im not in school) when i can work full-time. but at this point? i dont want to continue. **i hope my school burns to the ground. it is a bastion of failure that has destroyed me and brought my mental illness back.**",2019-01-02 21:21:26,ACfireandiceDC,1
ab1q6n,life is no longer worth living.,SuicideWatch,"when i was a young kid, i showed signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it got really bad when i was older (18, right after i graduated high school - the de-stabilizing effect of transitioning from high school to community college messed me up). i always had a low self esteem and have believed in a prophecy that i was never ""meant to"" succeed.two years later it got better, but two years after that, i got accepted to a university - yay! but it did the same thing to me. my mental illness relapsed. my ocd this time was more pure-o and the thoughts were absolutely horrible. my grades declined. now, a bit of a back story: i developed a medical problem: long story short, i developed difficulty swallowing (i now have meds for acid reflux but the problem is still undiagnosed). but i would be constantly hungry 24/7, and as a result, unable to focus or concentrate on schoolwork or fall asleep at a reasonable hour. i developed a coping mechanism by drinking homemade fruit smoothies. unfortunately, however, those are really expensive, and in a year, i turned a $6,300 savings into a $1,200 credit card debt. even that was not enough to solve the problem, and the ""hangriness"" made the ocd obsessive thoughts worse.last summer i got a mechanical engineering internship - hooray! but i thought it was too good to be true, so i sabotaged it. :( i was expected to work 6am to noon, five days a week, plus a calculus class 6pm to 9pm, four days a week, plus four hours a day of studying. i failed the class and got fired from the internship for showing up late and being tired on the job.i am not lazy. i have had several jobs recently where i work 40-50 hours per week in manual labor with little to no issues. but i need someone else to structure my time for me. i despise school because of my failures and associate many negative things with it.a development in my ocd has made me guilty for taking free time. i dont play guitar anymore (when i was 15 i practiced for 90 minutes per day and got extremely good as a result). i wanted to start reading as well - i bought some really cool books almost two years ago - but i havent gotten around to reading them, because of aforementioned ocd, or guilt that i dont deserve free time. ive only relaxed a couple of times this year. all of my ""free time"" is spent being extremely hungry, frantically going grocery shopping for food, preparing food, or making futile efforts to eat said food (often at midnight, 1am or 2am). or just plain feeling guilty for taking free time. i never relaxed. for example, a year ago, i bought a ticket to go see cannibal corpse in concert. even after i had bought the ticket, and even after the concert started, i was still trying to decide whether or not to go.my parents are also very keen on my grades, because they have not been very good. my dad has threatened to take me out of school if they are not good (but in that case my mom has offered to loan me money for a semester). plus, the credit card debt. plus, he told me that unless extreme measures are taken, i will have to take out a loan for school. plus, i made my dad furious at me for dropping the ball on him and ignoring his texts (due to my anxiety - but im afraid hell just think im making excuses).i have so much anxiety right now that i cant even look at his texts...im 23, and will not experience graduation until i am 26 or 27 because the ocd-based problems have put me behind. i am a failure. my lack of a career has made me an undesirable romantic partner to women. i dont have the will to kill myself but i have the thoughts of it. i have no hobbies anymore, because my mental and physical health have eaten up my free time. i want to be like my 15-year-old self, who always drew really cool artwork out of pure, creative artistic passion. the guy who always pushed himself to get better at guitar. i even got close to learning how to play ""through the fire and flames"" in real life, in its entirety. i want to be that kind of a person again.",2018-12-31 02:34:17,ACfireandiceDC,1
9rw1md,i'm wondering if i may have depression... does this sound like it?,depression,"ive been feeling really down lately. i feel like i may have some symptoms of depression, albeit more mild than what some people deal with. here are my symptoms; yes, i know that i cant be professionally diagnosed by anonymous people on the internet, but im wondering what you make of these:* none of my college classes take attendance; because of this, and the fact that i have trouble getting anywhere on time, i always sometimes miss class or sleep in and miss them, because i think, ""oh, well, im gonna be late anyway"".* my anxiety makes me freak out over doing things. two of my bands last night were playing at a venue 20 minutes away from where i live, and i didnt go because i was freaking out about schoolwork and what my mom might think if i did go (even though im 23).* sometimes i just opt to not do things because i dont want to deal with the anxiety of doing them.* i dont socialize often, and a lot of the conversations i have even with my good friends can often feel ""forced"", and my drive to be social is kind of diminishing.* my sex drive has been abnormally low for the past 1-2 weeks, and i get 0 pleasure out of watching porn or masturbating.* i was gonna go running in a half-marathon tomorrow with this one girl i met at university. she bailed on me this morning, texting me a photo of a severe allergic reaction she had to an antibiotic. but the problem is, even though shes really pretty and we love going running together, i dont even feel bad. in fact, im dreading waking up early for the race tomorrow morning.",2018-10-27 20:27:44,ACfireandiceDC,1

abvjj3,can help actually make things worse?,depression,"ive had depression for almost half my life, since i was 13 and im in my mid 20s now. ive never taken meditation, seen a therapist, consular, or any of that. not that i dont believe in it i mean im sure people have been cured from it but i think it only works for certain kinds of depression. like normal people who have for the most part lived normal lives but then something happens like the death of a loved one or a bad break up. short term depression that was caused by a single incident rather than people like us who are just depressed at our overall life. id say 2 years ago i was having the same thoughts and feelings as everyone here but now i can no longer relate with these thoughts. i still fully understand them i mean i am still depressed but after a lot of self reflection and soul searching ive managed to lower my depression by becoming aware of it and finally just doing something about it. depression is a battle against yourself, you know whats wrong and know what to do to get better but the hard part is actually working up the motivation to do it. the depressing thoughts that run all day about the past and future sap the motivation away and make you more depressed, making you wonder if its even worth it because of how much time youve already wasted or having tried everything before.this feeling of hopelessness i feel is fueled even more by having had that help and when none of it worked it further saps your motivation. this is just a theory of mine though, what did you guys think?",2019-01-02 19:35:24,Kinaibhlan,1

abuqmq,30 years old and feeling like my life is over,depression,"2018 was a pretty bad year for me. my contract ended in december 2017 (the company i was working for basically told me i wasnt analytical enough to work there, even though they were hemorrhaging money and laying people off) and i was unemployed until i got a summer position with the provincial government, which i was hoping would turn into something more (as well as giving me access to internal postings) but didnt because a month into that the provincial government instituted a hiring freeze (and so much for the ~50 internal postings i applied for, all cancelled). the summer job was super demoralizing because they just stuck me in an office alone with nothing to do, and paid me minimum wage. i have a university education, and ~2.5 years experience in my field. ive been unemployed since august (my unemployment benefit has run out) and im losing my mind. im 0 for 4 for the interviews ive done since then. after the last one went so bad i had a panic attack and had a meltdown in-front of my parents. im out of money, i had to borrow money from my parents which feels awful and they also arent charging me rent right now (i live in an apartment in an income property of theirs). my parents are retired and this property is their only income, and now that im not paying rent they arent making any money on it. i feel absolutely worthless. ive tried applying to other minimum wage jobs but i get the feeling that they see my education and experience and figure i will just leave when something better comes along (which is true). i feel so worthless. im having existential crises almost daily, i keep crying which is something i never used to do. i make an effort to get out of my apartment, go to the gym, go on walks and volunteer but it isnt helping that much. im going to either have to get a roommate or give up my apartment and move back in with my parents. my friends are getting married, buying condos, getting new jobs and here i am still all fucked up. my confidence is in the dirt again (i suffered from crohns disease for a few years which totally broke my confidence, thats in remission now thankfully but i am having trouble affording the medication) after it took so long to get it back. ive been drinking, smoking weed and eating mushrooms just to get out of my head once in a while but of course any temporary relief that provides just brings me even lower when it wears off. ive been trying to get sober for a long time (even went to an aa meeting a few weeks ago)  but i can never make it stick for longer than a week or so because i start to feel bad about myself and use. i feel like a fucking loser and im having trouble convincing myself that im not. ive always felt like a bit of a misfit but im starting to feel like im just not good enough for anything at this point. im so twisted up and i dont know what to do.

6cgf0z,all i look forward too lately is sedation.,depression,"2014 and 2015 were the worst years of my life, i developed a  bad autoimmune disease and still managed to struggle through the end of an undergrad program and then a grad program. 2016 was a bad year too. i was unemployed for most of it, listless, living in my parents attic. i was drinking a lot because i didnt know what else to do with my time. i was depressed and having anxiety attacks.2017 has been a lot better. im employed, i dont hate my job, and i have my own apartment. the thing is, im starting to feel like my life is becoming just this: i work, and then immediately after work most of the time i just want to go home and zone out. every day is becoming exactly the same. i feel empty. im starting to feel like my life is just going to grind to a halt here, there will be no growth, no more novelty. ive been abusing drugs in order to help expedite the sedation. etizolam, alcohol, phenibut, marijuana. yesterday i wasnt feeling very well due to a lingering sickness and i combined almost all of these (drank a few beers, took a few etizolam pills, ate some marijuana chocolate) and i was bedridden and mostly sleeping from 2pm until 6 am this morning. it was really great, i feel much better. this was the level of sedation i find myself often trying to achieve. to be honest the only reason i got out of bed was because my back was starting to hurt. i know this isnt healthy and i have to stop drinking and drugging like this or else things are going to unravel. i was really good about going to the gym, buying and cooking food, keeping things clean, i know these are the things im supposed to do but sometimes i just dont see the point. i gave online dating a shot, hell i even had a date set up for this weekend, but i have no sex drive and absolutely no desire to even bother seeing anyone lately. last year the goals were: get the career going, get the apartment. i achieved those, yet i still dont feel very good about things, and now that ive achieved those goals i feel like i dont know whats next. is this all there is? im starting to feel like theres just no point into any of this. how do i find meaning? i have no goals, no aspirations, and im pretty much a misanthrope. everything is a rat race and i play the game because i know im supposed to, but my heart isnt into it.

abumv2,i’m struggling to keep myself together.,depression,"in october of 2017, i was having relationship issues and took a break from my boyfriend of 5 years. i moved 2 states away to live with family while him and i tried to work on ourselves for a bit. a few days after i got settled i decided to try to catch up with old friends. i asked a former close friend from high school if he wanted to get coffee or something sometime, he said sure. he picked me up and we went for a few drinks at a nice-ish bar. unfortunately i didn’t know him well enough, because i was drugged, beaten, and raped by him. i didn’t go to the police until february of 2018 after i found out he also drugged and raped two close friends of mine. he was finally arrested this past august, and the next court date is next week. just over a month after i was raped, i pulled a muscle in my back at work so badly that it wrapped around to my abdomen and made me think i was having appendicitis. i drove back to the office (barely), threw my truck keys to my supervisor (i was a letter carrier for usps) and went to urgent care. was told i pulled a muscle really bad and to take a few days off of work. i could barely walk, stand, or sit down. i went back to work on light duty/office work only but still couldn’t handle that. i was home for months while workers comp gave me the runaround. in march of last year they told me they were going to rescind my case if i didn’t send a letter stating why i needed to be out of work. i did, and they rescinded it anyway. i was forced to quit, which broke my heart because i loved carrying and made good money without needing a degree. fast forward a few months and my primary care doctor diagnosed me with osteoarthritis in my lower back at the ripe old age of 24. my boyfriend made things work and i moved back in with him in april 2018. were far from perfect and still have problems but we’ve come a long way. we celebrated our 6 year anniversary this past november.working and finding work was and is hard. i went back to bridal dress sales (which i did for a few years before usps), but my physical limitations forced me to resign because i couldn’t handle it all. i tried car sales because the money was enticing and there’s a lot of down time. i survived only about 2-3 weeks, as sitting all day was making the pain worse and the atmosphere there was absolutely terrible. i found a part time prep cook job for a catering company, and i’ve been there since september (i work 6 hours a day max and moving a lot keeps my back from stiffening up). there are still a lot of days that i can’t get out of bed and have to call out. i need to find a different job that isn’t painful for me and has a larger salary than what i make now but i have no idea what to look for. i was diagnosed with ptsd after being raped, exacerbated by my rather extreme anxiety, which is also paired with depression. i started antidepressants and got on a new anxiety medication in july. i’ve had no side effects but the antidepressants aren’t working like they should.my back pain started to spread this past summer. depending on the day i have widespread pain, mostly in my back, shoulders, neck, and hips, that’s anywhere from a 3-8 on a pain scale out of 10. i’ve gone for two rounds of extremely painful steroid injections in my spine but have had no relief. i have to go for one more round in a different location, and if those don’t work i’ll most likely be sent to a neurosurgeon. my primary care doctor referred me to a rheumatologist months ago but they haven’t called me for an appointment and despite the constant calls to my doctor, nothing has really been done. all of these issues have caused brain fog and i have a lot of trouble remembering short term things. i haven’t seen my therapist since early november between the holidays and her taking vacation time. i have to call her for another appointment but a small part of me is hesitant to do so but i can’t figure out why.between my mental health problems and physical issues and pain (i also have 2 thyroid conditions, one of which being autoimmune), i have no energy to do anything. i sleep a lot but i almost always feel exhausted. i don’t call my family or return texts. they get mad at me and i try to explain to them that i don’t do it purposely but the just say i’m making excuses.my family doesn’t know that i was raped. i honestly hate 99% of my family (my grandmother, who raised me, is the only one i really get along with. and even then she can be difficult at times). they all gossip and speculate and can’t keep their noses in their own business. my cousin started anti anxiety meds over a year ago and they still talk about it like she’s a heroin junkie (i haven’t told them about my meds because i knew they’d do this exact thing). they all like to embellish stories and tell everyone they know about trauma concerning family members. i don’t want anyone to know about this unless *i* want them to. i forgot to take my meds for the last two days and i feel like shit. shaky, mind racing, increased heart rate. anxiety is horrible lately and being off my meds for just two days has fucked me up. i finally got out of bed and took them this morning after having an anxiety attack where that nasty voice in the back of my mind told me i should just kill myself. i’m not exactly suicidal, though i do often wish that i’d get hit by a car, or shot in the head by a stray bullet, or have a heart attack in my sleep so i didn’t have to suffer anymore. i don’t have the moxie to end my own life. my life is basically sleeping, waking up, taking upwards of an hour to be able to stand up, take thyroid meds (which makes my stomach upset because i can’t eat for an hour afterwards), limp to my car or call out if i can’t walk. endure anxiety attacks all day. try to calm myself when ptsd inevitably flares up. set aside 20 minutes or so to call various doctors/refills prescriptions/talk with my advocate about upcoming court dates. do my best to not let the bodily pain get to me. try to remember to take my afternoon meds. make food for myself. lay down, but not for too long otherwise my hips and back lock up. try to remember to take bedtime meds. sleep for at least 8 hours, wake up exhausted. i’m just so sick of living like this. the only thing that helps my pain (mentally and physically) is cannabis, but my tolerance has gotten higher (pun not intended) and i feel like it’s lost its efficacy. i’m tired of being tired. tired of not being able to go out and do things. tired of needing help to get up out of chairs or off the couch. tired of existing. my name is brittany. i just turned 25. my body is falling apart and i genuinely wish i were dead.

abstdh,"it's really helped my depression greatly not being at work the last week. knowing that, how can i survive when work resumes?",depression,"its not completely disappeared of course, but having this week off has enabled me to really invest in myself and engage in more mindful tasks.ive also done a lot of things ive been meaning to do - fix stuff around the house, service the car, etc - at my own pace. these things are now no longer thorns in the back of my mind whenever i leave or come home from work. it feels healthy to have these things done and maintained.in the mornings i go and grab a coffee and just chill out for an hour. been really enjoying my own company and the pace not being at work gives me.ive also done a lot physical stuff like joined a rock climbing gym and have done a lot of cycling.so, it feels like work is the opposite of this. im never home, so things that should be fixed up remain broken. i never have time to go to the gym (i do try to get in exercise by cycling to and from work) and sitting in the morning with a cup of coffee for an hour is out of the question.i dont think i am a lazy person, but it feels like a lazy lifestyle kinda helps my mental state. but, ive got bills to pay, of course, so i need to work.so, i guess, how can i survive when i go back to work and have no more time for myself?",2019-01-02 14:04:22,MeltingDog,1

abs7df,therapy was the best thing in my life.,depression,"so this is going to be a long one. also english isnt my first language so fuck ups might happen. (germany)my childhood wasnt the best. with 4 years my mother divorced my father. she got in a new relationship fast after that. he was abusive (physicly, mentally and sexual) to me and my brothers. somehow my mother never new what was going on ( i still wonder about it to this day).when i was 6 he kidnapped my mother and tried forcing her to marry him. they left me and my brothers home to starve. lucky to us was that im not easy to bring down. i cared for my 3 disabled brothers for 3 weeks until the neighbours realized what was going on and calledthe police. they documented our bodys and askes us many questions (cps was there). since i didnt know where our mother or our father was they put me and my younger brother in fostercare and my older disabled brothers in a psychatric clinic. for 4 months we wouldnt see us.on the 15th dezember 2003 we drove with cps to sos-kinderdorf. at that moment we didnt even know what that was.you could think now that this should be the part of my life now that was going to be good. but no.. it started all over again. i was abused mentally and physiclly again. i always got told that i will end up like my father (who was a drunk no good person) that i will never have something good happen in my life that it would be better if i was dead. at that moment i was 9yrs old. it was only one person that did that to me. he also beat me quite often. they found out and fired him a few months later.fast forward 6 years.im im realschule now. my grades are good only in math i struggle. im getting 6s (fs) quite often.so they (sos-kinderdorf) decide without me knowing that i should repeat the 8th class.i never had many friends but after that i had no friends anymore. i had only one thing in my life that was pushing me to go forward. the wish to become a soldier in the military (bundeswehr). everyone was telling me that i wont make it through the musterung (i dont know the english word for it). but i did. i got a contract for 4 years with the pioneers.but now shit hit the fan. i got ill. super fucking ill. i lost 25kg (50pounds) and couldnt walk for weeks. they dropped the contract. i lost everything in 2015. only thing that kept me alive was my gf. but in 2017 i couldnt keep it anymore. i wrote good bye letters to all of my family. got in bed and tried to end it on 25th of dezemberbut something kept me from doing it. i dont know what it was. maybe my cat.  the next morning i went to my doctor told him everything. soon after that i had my first talk with a psychologist. and on november 7th of 2018 i got into a clinic. i got the therapy i needed. i am now finally happy to be alive again. im not only surviving the day but living the day. im not scared anymore more. im happy and want to see what the future is holding for me.i hope you all have a wonderful 2019.my gf broke up with me while i was in therapy. it was a ""clean"" break up and we will stay friends.",2019-01-02 12:23:39,Pilzmann,0

a0vmx9,uneven support,depression,"most of us have a story like this. we give more to someone than they give to us. i just had a friendship that ended and was exactly like this. im not going to go into details but there was a lot of good and bad from both our sides to the other. the part i wanted to focus on was the final thing i saw from them, an instagram post. it was directed at me, and you might have seen this image before, it stated""when a toxic person can no longer control you, they will try to control how others see you. the misinformation will feel unfair, but stay above it, trusting that other people will eventually see the truth, just like you did""i was sent this before as well from a previous ex friend who made me believe, at the time, that i was controlling and toxic because i had a mental breakdown and went to them for support after they told me i could do that. they made me feel guilty for hurting. my issue with this quote is, when is it misinformation and when is it truth. if youre lying about what they did, yes youre being toxic, but if its the truth and the other person claims youre being toxic, thats no longer the case, they are the toxic ones.this friend of mine was my roommate. we were extremely close friends and i was there for them for every mental break they had. i had one because of all the stress and insanity happening around me, things i bottled up (and shouldnt have but i was afraid of being the bad guy) and i told them i wanted to die and needed someone there for me. they told me they were tired and to call someone else. this sent me spiraling out of control, i had been sleep deprived helping them but they wouldnt be there for me. i already had issues feeling worthless and this sealed it for me. they had my gun in their possession (i gave it to them because i couldnt trust myself anymore and i trusted they would keep it from me). i asked them for it, they said no, i offered to give them their knife back and they immediately handed my loaded gun back to me. they even said, ""be safe"". that is not something a decent person does, not a friend, not family, but just a generally decent person. then they proceed to call me toxic and controlling. i was sad about losing them, i cried a lot, but good lord i cant do it anymore. thats horrible.i finally found my self worth, confidence, and self esteem. ive been suicidal since i was 10 (my first attempt). right now, i dont want to die, i want to live a full life. this is all so unfamiliar to me and uncomfortable because depression is what im used to. feeling like im unworthy of love, support, care, or compassion. that my worth is completely tied to what i give others so id set myself on fire to keep them warm. im not like that now. im trying to keep positive, also something im not used to.",2018-11-27 17:05:09,Mirisido,1

9l2k9p,going through the worst depressive episode of my life.,depression,"hey guys. so a bit of background. &#x200b;im in my late 20s, and i was diagnosed with depression a few months ago. i had dealt with it my entire life, but i had never really handled it well. after dealing with the end of a relationship, i snapped and ended up self-admitting to the psych ward because i was unable to handle it. &#x200b;since then, things have gotten a lot worse. i came to college late, and this is now my sixth year in college. i went to get an associates degree, which i finished every class but 1 (without knowing). i had already applied and been accepted to a 4 year program by the time i found out that i needed one more class. so im 1 class away from having my associates. anyways, i decided to go to a 4 year school, i had a job that made college relatively cheap, and it was a job i really enjoyed. well, after 2 years in the program, i realized i was basically stuck. i kept taking and dropping the same two classes because around mid-term it became obvious i was not going to pass them. when i finally decided to go to counseling (right before my mental breakdown), my counselor suggested i look into another major. so i picked up another major, and im having the same exact issue. ive also had a counselor i was very close with leave due to medical reasons, forcing me to try to get to know a new counselor. on top of that, ive had several appointments canceled due to emergencies, so i rarely get to go to counseling anyways. &#x200b;im also struggling more with my depression because ive been fighting it alone a lot more lately. when i had my break down, i had one friend i trusted with my mental health issues. she was a girl i cared about a lot, and we sort of...messed around with the idea of dating, but it never went anywhere. when she started a new relationship, it strained our friendship heavily. now shes at the point where any time i try to vent to her, she just tells me i have to help myself, and rarely says anything else. my counselor suggested i reach out to other people, which i did, and for a while it went really well, but now those people have stopped being responsive. my friend used to be super sensitive toward me, and always said uplifting things, or invited me to do certain things, but since theyve graduated and started a new relationship, they have virtually no time for me, or when they do, its because they force themselves to make time for me. they still allow me to vent, but ive exhausted them to the point where they never try to say anything positive to cheer me up. its always apologizing for how i feel, saying that it sucks, and trying to suggest i do this or that to make myself feel better. its never anything positive. &#x200b;in relation to my job, im an ra on my college campus. ive been on campus for a while, and its a pretty small campus. long story short, a lot of people are aware of who i am. im known as the dude who has been at college forever. my bosses all preach constantly about coming to them for help when youre struggling with classes, but i couldnt bring myself too, and now im in this situation where dropping out is the only logical action, but if i drop out, im going to disappoint my family, my friends, and my supervisors at my only ""real"" job. i dont know if theyd refuse to give me a good recommendation, but i know theyll lecture me about how i should have done this, or i should have done that.  &#x200b;im now 6 years into college, at least 3 years away from getting a bachelors degree, and nothing else to show for it. i have virtually no friends, the ones i do have grown sick of me being depressed. my home life is awful, every time i go home i go into a deep depression, and my friends from high school all make things worse. im so terrified of dropping out because i dont want to move back home, but i also dont really have anywhere else to go. i have a vehicle, so i can potentially get a job, but my vehicle is in really bad shape, and i dont live in an area where public transit is really an option to get to work. i feel like i have no options. &#x200b;i dont know what i want to hear, but i just needed to vent. i needed people to understand and care, because right now it feels like nobody in my life really cares.

abqi35,i need to release some of my anger,depression,"im getting real sick and fucking tired of people at my school who constantly try and slide in the fact that they ""want to kill themselves"" out of nowhere in conversation. i know what theyre doing, they want attention. ive had a few friends with depression, none of them do this shit. i should mention that the people that do this shit often wear cat ears, black nail polish, black clothes, and one of them wears a fucking anime jacket, that is ridiculous to even look at. i guess theyre emos, idk. i legit had a friend who i thought had actual depression for 4 fucking months, and i found out that its mainly bullshit they were spewing. idk if this has anything to do with it, but shes normally happy, but when shes around me, she always has to say something about her wanting to kill herself out of literal fucking nowhere. i could be talking about memes and i will say something like ""god this meme makes me want to eat napalm"", (meaning id die because the meme is too dank), and she would just nervously and excitingly say ""oh! i wanna do that so i can die"". i can tell that shes not making a joke because shes not smiling nor laughing, she just wants attention from me. i talked to my other friends who hang out with her, and they said that she doesnt do this around them. i just generally hate people who crave attention they dont need. not only do the emo fake depression fuckers annoy me, but the people in my school that want so fucking bad to be viewed as smarter than the entire class. idgaf if she sees this, her name is sara, and she does this bullshit. always raises her hand the highest and tries her best to seem smart af. i normally would ignore this, but she will go out of her way to go up to me and my friend max (me and him act really dumb all the time but you can tell that were joking), and just say ""oh, i can only take so much of your stupidity"", or ""you guys make me lose brain cells, youre so annoying"". shes not joking around, she just goes out of her way to say this shit to appear smart. my friend max doesnt care, but i do. this is my problem, i dont respond to things that anger me, i let it absorb into my body, and contain it for a long period of time, most of the time just holding on to it for pretty much forever. this is the only way i know to relieve myself of this. its either this, or i have a notebook full of letters to people that piss me off, and me going off on them on paper. im probably not going to send these letters, but its just to relieve myself from the weight on my shoulders.

(mom works in a hospital, mind you, which now makes me worried sick for whoever she has as a patient.)i was miserable before taking drugs and i made friends because of it. the very best friends ive ever had because of it (most dropped out and moved back halfway across the country.) if i dont have any kind of release, ill probably kill myself and actually get it right this time.i feel like i have less support than before and that sharing that burden is cruel.",2018-07-29 23:06:38,Acid_Enthusiast,1

735l0h,i feel free,SuicideWatch,"i posted here earlier in the week about a recent suicide attempt, and i would like everyone who posts here to say good-bye or to share their anguish to read this so that they may be inspired by what has transpired in less than a week after a failed attempt.i know im not supposed to talk about methods, but its relevant to my story and can give you hope as to when your ""better"" that everyone always says gets can happen. i was drinking an entire bottle of jonny walker as fast as i could to kill myself when in my drunken state i called up my best friend to tell him how i felt (maybe i was pussying out, maybe i was just drunk, at this point ill never care.) he stayed on the line for over an hour with me to talk me down from the ledge, and so in the time i spent talking and not drinking, i didnt consume enough quickly enough to be lethal (it was a fucking monster of a hangover though) and i woke up the next day numb to the outside world. when i saw him again on wednesday, he gave me a great big hug and a necklace that was given to him when he went through suicidal depression from his unitarian church that turned his life around. on the necklace, it reads, ""what the caterpillar perceives as the end, to the butterfly is just the beginning."" seeing the kind of support and effort my friend was giving just about tore me in half. when people tell you to think about your loved ones, it isnt to shame you into not doing it because of someone elses sake, its because they want you to look at the people you can turn to for help. i never told a soul for the 9 long years i suffered from suicidal depression until i told him. i burdened myself with my demons because i dont like making my problem anyone elses, and so i played the part of atlas, carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders when i didnt have to. i now understand that there are different ways of looking at things in life, like a phrase such as ""think of your loved ones,"" or the analogy between the caterpillar and the butterfly. we can look at every outcome in a negative, bleak way like our lives are over, or we can see it as an opportunity to start fresh and get back in the hunt, whatever it is were hunting for. and if the hunt scares you, dont let it. dont feed emotions that arent worth feeding. if you suffer from social anxiety like i did, dont think about the rejection aspect that isnt even guaranteed with each encounter, think about the prospect of meeting new friends who might be as wonderful as my best friend, someone who will stand by your side as you walk down the most lonesome road known to mankind. think of looking for a job in the most competitive labor market as the chance to find your calling in life. think of a break-up in a long-term relationship as the chance to meet someone who wont leave you or you them.but what you need to know is that it all depends on you. you might not have to feed depression and sorrow and pain, but in order to feed a zest for life, an appreciation for nature, or general happiness, you need something to feed it with. take me for example. i long for a relationship because ive never had one. i no longer feel despair over that fact, i instead make it my best effort to get what i want and i am excited for what i know will be around the corner, and theres nothing women love more than a confident man whos sure of himself. it will take hard work to present the best version of myself, but thats the one i want everyone to know; the one who smiles at every stranger i meet, the one who sits with people who eat their lunch alone, the one who is no longer afraid or ashamed of asking for help. and i would like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for reaching out for help and offering help to those who truly need it, because youre doing heavenly work.its been a roller-coaster of a week for me, with some fucking nutty ups and downs, but i long for the ups nowadays, and i am willing to make it my lifes work to reach out to those of you in need. i dont even have what i want out of life yet, and i already know im not going to attempt suicide ever again because of the future i can have if i put my best foot forward and add a little strut to my walk, humming ripple by the grateful dead all along the way. please heed my advice if it makes a modicum of sense to you, because i want all of you to get out of this hell we find ourselves in. i love you all, and i believe there are other people out there who value your life and want you to stick around. ill be the president of your fan club if no one wants to join. stay with us, and godspeed.

8equmz,what i did to get better,depression,"so back in 2012, i was pretty miserable.  i had just moved back to my parents home after doing a 4-year stint in another city (which i did after getting out of a mental hospital, thinking that by moving away i could ""start fresh"").  i was so depressed that i could barely talk.i had just gotten back from a friends wedding in another city, where i basically drank wine like it was water and passed out drunk next to a port-a-potty, fairly early in the night.  i was sure that i was going to kill myself soon.  absolutely, positively certain.i remember my mom driving me somewhere, and she just broke down crying, saying that i needed to get a job.  i couldnt even say anything to that.  here i was, 28 years old, unemployed, living at my parents with a broken brain that wouldnt stop telling me how much i suck and how ill never get better.id tried like every antidepressant out there.  i felt like my depression was stronger than any antidepressant.  like those were for normal people who get sad.  i felt almost too smart for antidepressants, like the way that they actually work is all placebo effect and i dont fall for that kind of thing.this was like my 8th major depressive episode, by the way.  id already been hospitalized 4 times by this point.  and one of those times, the hospitalization actually made me feel better, and i came out full of confidence, which resulted in me moving away from my hometown, which resulted, eventually, in everything falling apart in a city where i barely knew anyone.  i remember crying on my way home from work for almost an entire winter.anyway, i was drifting.  i had nothing to do and i was terrified of every social interaction.  i forget who found it, me or my parents, but i read that nih in the dc area was doing a study on ketamine as an antidepressant.  id done ketamine before, and i actually remembered that it made me feel euphoric for a couple of months (after a weekends worth of use).  i called, and was accepted.so i moved up to bethesda, md.  i was in a hospital ward, but it wasnt locked or anything.  in fact, i did a lot of sightseeing, eventually.  in the beginning all i did was stay in my room and watch netflix.  i didnt even talk to anyone else.  people there thought i was standoffish, i later learned.i had to get weaned off my medications first for the ketamine trial.  that took like 6 weeks.  i didnt feel any different, helping to strengthen my suspicion that the medicines i was on didnt actually do anything.  i also got my brain scanned a few times, which involved sitting for a really long time inside an mri tube and not moving.  once i fell asleep in there.then the trial!  well, maybe.  it was an experiment where they gave you 2 infusions: one is actually ketamine, the other is placebo (saline, i think).but i got k the first time.  of course i cant say that with 100% certainty, because they never revealed which was which, but i was seeing shapes and colors and trails and was saying that i couldnt control my mouth and words were being spoken through me rather than by me.  the second time i felt nothing at all, so judge for yourself.however, even though i experienced the k, i didnt actually feel better.  i only started to feel better when they put me on zyprexa, which amazingly stopped my social anxiety.  then i started talking to other people in the trial, and making some friends.  i was still depressed but was functional.i went home around thanksgiving.  i had started running and cooking while at nih, and tried to keep that up at home.  i wasnt happy, but i was talking, and that was a start.  i was still basically a nervous wreck, but i got an interview for a coding job, did really well, and got the job (for some reason im never nervous at interviews).  i spent the first month at that job almost puking from anxiety every day, but i made some friends with the smokers, and i realized that it wasnt so bad.  plus it was easy.  plus i could move into my own place now!but i still wasnt happy.  however, one of the other people from the ketamine clinical trial apparently had wonderful results with k and started http://www.ketamineadvocacynetwork.org/ to promote its use as an antidepressant.  i found a doctor near me who administered it, and called him up.  when he heard i was in the clinical trial, he set me up with an appointment (i guess because id basically been pre-screened by the government).i got a series of 5 infusions.  each time i tripped balls.  i mean, ive done drugs, but this was about as wild as it gets.  however, it was different from other experiences, in that i felt like i could experience my mind from outside of itself.  like i could analyze it without judgement, and change it without fear.right after the first infusion, i felt a burst of energy and went running (when i got home).  the next day, everything felt lighter, easier, like it was a game.  these feelings intensified after each infusion, and i gradually thought i had a ""cheat code"" for life.this seems appropriate; its from an interview with donald glover:> glover said that he thinks of reality as a program and his talent as hacking the code: “i learn fast—i figured out the algorithm.” grasping the machine’s logic had risks. “when people become depressed and kill themselves, it’s because all they see is the algorithm, the loop,” he said. but it was also exhilarating. when he was ten, he said, “i realized, if i want to be good at p.e., i have to be good at basketball. so i went home and shot baskets in our driveway for six hours, until my mother called me in. the next day, i was good enough that you wouldn’t notice i was bad. and i realized my superpower.”anyway, that was about 4 years ago.  i now have a prescription for ketamine, which i take at maintenance levels.  ive gone through a lot of bad shit in those 4 years, but ive taught myself how to become resilient (the trick is to go through bad stuff a lot...bend but dont break).  i try to help other people by facilitating dbsa meetings and talking about my life.  i also started volunteering at habitat for humanity because physical effort is good and its good karma.my life isnt perfect.  im not dating anyone, and im worried that its a bad idea to date me because in the past ive fallen into depressions while with girlfriends, and they wouldnt take it well.  but ive got a good job and a nice place and a whole bunch of good friends, and hobbies, and i take fun trips and have little adventures all the time, and life is generally fun.i still get anhedonic sometimes, which worries me, but so far its gone away after a bit.  when things seem to be going south, i double down on things i know are good for me: meditation, running, eating better, seeing friends, volunteering.  i think its key to have lots of different options for ""nudging"" myself into feeling better.  theres no silver bullet option that will always fix my buggy brain, but there are a whole lot of decent debugging techniques.  if one doesnt work, i try another.  so far it works ok.",2018-04-25 07:22:34,extruder,0
6sb8r3,depression as reward-deprived childhood,depression,"this is just a theory:theres basically 2 ways to condition behavior.  theres rewards and punishments.  those are the ways we ingrain in ourselves patterns of behavior: we do things to get rewards and avoid punishments.in healthy people, rewards and punishments are experienced in roughly equal proportions, or rewards are given more frequently than punishments.  ideally, most learning is done through rewards, but ""reward satiation"" may set in if rewards are too frequent, necessitating a break from rewards, which in itself will be considered a punishment.one form of depression comes from a punishment-centric system.  these punishments may be self-imposed, as in one who feels bad when achieving at any ""unacceptably low"" level and constantly badgers ones self to get better.  punishments may also be imposed by an outside authority; since in my life most punishments have been self-imposed, i dont have much to say about that.ideally, a system would be in place that punishes infrequently but firmly and rewards frequently and obviously.  healthy growth will be achievable in this kind of system, provided that good behaviors are inculcated this way.  most of us didnt grow up in systems like this, though; most of us grew up in punishment-dominated systems, whether consciously or unconsciously designed that way.i had a depressed mom.  she would frequently break down crying, and i was always left wondering if it was because of something i did (and frequently it was, but it was stuff like not cleaning up after myself, not major infractions).  its taken years to convince myself that im not a bad person and i deserve good things, and im still worried that one day all the old bad feelings will return.i feel like its my duty to write this stuff down and hopefully connect with others.  i know that when i was in the midst of all of the depressions, it meant so much to me when i read something mirroring my experience.if this doesnt match how your depression works, id love to hear the differences.  i think that discovering root causes of depression is a lifelong process, but as we figure it out we also figure out compensation strategies that work for us.",2017-08-08 07:42:04,extruder,1

3v8umf,remember: things can change.,depression,"im writing this as much as a reminder to me as advice for others, because god knows i need it many, many times.the brain has remarkable plasticity.  its ability to reorganize and make entire neural networks switch functions is well-demonstrated.depression is a pattern that is crystallized in neural circuits.  its like a computer program: do x, feel bad.  see x, feel bad.  remember x, feel bad.  and triggering those ""feel bad"" circuits leads to chemical releases that inhibit the ability to feel good.  thoughts create mood, and mood then influences thoughts.in prolonged depressions, everything becomes a trigger to feel bad.  for me, its coming home to a messy place, all alone.  ill then start to think ""i should clean"" and immediately feel worse for multiple reasons: i have no reason to clean because i never invite anyone over.  im a bad person because im so lazy i dont clean.  im going to kill myself anyway, eventually, so theres no reason to clean.but i have this gift that is incredibly rare: the ability to inspect and re-route my own thoughts.  so i say, these thoughts are doing me no good.  i have tried these thoughts and they made things worse.  so im going to let the thoughts pass, and then actually clean my place.it may make me feel better.  it may not.  (spoiler: it did).  but knowing that im not a slave to the patterns of thought that i gravitate towards helps me.tomorrow, i can be a different person.  i will wake up with time to spare, put on nice clothes, go to work, and talk to people.  it might not feel like me, but who cares, i dont really enjoy that me anyway.  ill enjoy being this other, new me.  as long as i act consciously, i can choose how to act.  i can pretend like i know that things are getting better, and ill keep pretending until they actually are getting better.i dont have to be the same me i was today.  i have no obligation to maintain my personality.  im free to choose.and i know that this advice only applies to some of you right now.  there were points in my depression where the idea of controlling my own thoughts was ridiculous; i was absolutely too deep in the self-loathing and hopelessness to think of helping myself.  but meds, therapy, and slowly re-integrating myself into society got me out of those lowest of low points.",2015-12-03 07:24:04,extruder,0

2sd1dg,"depression = overheating, overloaded brain",depression,"ive been trying to figure out the best metaphor for my depression.  getting a good metaphor means having something that explains everything: the good times, the crashes, the months of crushing apathy and lifelessness, the fear and anxiety that come from never knowing when the bad times will be back.my psychiatrist said something that really stuck with me a few months ago.  he said that the mind is like a computer rendering a 3d scene.  when the scene is simple, the mind has no problem processing it.  but as you add polygons, it becomes harder and harder to compute the image, until its so complicated that you cant operate in real-time anymore.  once it gets complicated enough, something has to go, be it frame rate or details.thoughts are the polygons that we have to render.  and were in an information-rich culture.  we are bombarded with things to think about, and we add even more things to think about through our own expectations.100 years ago, people processed things much slower, because there was no need to process so quickly.  there werent stimuli constantly demanding our attention...no tweets, no instagram, no computers, no tv.  so we ran at a lower clock speed, and it was healthy.  not to say that there wasnt depression back then, but im fairly sure it wasnt the epidemic that it is today.now, were conditioned to run at higher speeds.  we try to fill as many of those clock cycles as we can processing information, because that, to us, is ""valuable work"".  it feels valuable, at least.  again, because were conditioned to believe that taking in information is a virtue.but if were not taking in information, we self-generate thoughts to fill those cycles.  it would be terrific if those thoughts were things like ""i am a wonderful person"", but most often, theyre not.  theyre things like ""why am i not rich?"" and ""why am i fat?"" and ""why isnt my life the way i want it?"".  and our brains use their spare cycles actually generating answers to those questions.  and they make us stressed, and they make us sad.and what really sucks is that our brains are convinced that they can think their way out of the problem, when the problem actually is overthinking.i think we need mandatory stimulus vacations.  time to sit and stare at nature.  time to just be human, without being plugged in.  im part of the damn problem, i know, an internet addict whose career involves social media marketing of all things.  im part of the system and i hate what the system has done to me, to you, to all of us.i thought i could outthink it, too, but today i realized how foolish that was.  i could actually feel my head pounding from the thoughts that all demanded to be heard.  so i sat and meditated for 20 minutes, and it made me feel a little bit better.  so thats going to be my practice.",2015-01-14 05:33:48,extruder,1

""oh! he seems tired! thats a symptom!"" ""he doesnt seem interested in talking. the brain tumor must be affecting his ability to speak"" ""he just want to lay down and watch cartoons. that has to be because the brain tumor is affecting his balance, making it hard for him to move"". and nothing will convince me otherwise. i even took to shining a light in to his eyes. as if i know what to even look for.who does that? this happens every time. the worst part is i will be starting a new job tomorrow or saturday.  how will i concentrate when my baby is at home with a ""brain tumor""? im tired of this. im on meds but its not enough. my doctor wanted to put me on xanax (just on anti depressants now) but i dont want that.",2016-08-11 20:52:47,RzadMMY90,1
a9t9uj,the weight of the world on my shoulders.,depression,"* i havent done much of this before so im not really sure where to start, and yes i know i wrote a lot. i guess i just dont feel comfortable sharing this fully with anyone i know personally so instead im appealing online to strangers. throughout my life, i have been through a variety of difficult situations (family/friend deaths, toxic relationships, financial struggles, social life, drug addiction, etc.) but one of the most difficult has been living with a port-wine stain on my face. although i have seen examples of stains much larger and grotesque than my own (mine covers the upper left lip looks a little bit like asap yamss), i have never quite been able to overcome living with it. my parents couldnt quite relate to what i was going through, and as a kid i was bullied heavily, and over time this caused me to develop into an outcast, and build a general distrust of people. * that being said, i have been lucky enough to have a small circle of trustworthy friends, but outside of that i have found difficulty trusting people (mainly due to a few humiliating backstabbing situations) and generally lack confidence. over time, i embraced my outcast nature, loved it even, wearing dark, stylish clothing and became a mysterious figure of sorts, but along with this came a sense of ridicule as no one took me seriously, and i was often taunted/bullied for being this outcast figure as no one else from my family was this way. all of these scenarios over time contributed to oncoming depression, and during high school, it culminated in an attempted suicide, which thankfully was unsuccessful. * following this scare, i decided to invest myself fully into my passions, which included acting and music, and began exercising and attending therapy. as an individual, i wanted to accomplish a few things in my lifetime. i firstly wanted to pursue my passions in entertainment fully, as i have dreamed of being an actor/musician my entire life as my career paths (despite knowing the insufferable odds of being successful) and know that i have a decent amount of talent/skill to be able to do so. secondly, i wanted to pursue these things without having my birthmark removed or lightened, as there is incredible power in representation in mass media platforms, and as an individual with a port wine stain, i wanted to be the role model i never had, and show kids/people around the world that they could be themselves without the need to conform to traditional beauty standards, not just the ones with pws. my third goal, to quote from riff raff, was to ""blow up and act like i dont know nobody"", and prove all the individuals who had contributed to making my life miserable that i could in fact be successful in my pursuits despite their attempts to make me feel like i couldnt. and i have so many ideas/concepts to make this happen, including representing my suffering in my art.* despite making minimal progress in these goals, my depression eventually came back (unrelated to my port wine stain), and in double the force. although i fear death too much now to attempt suicide again, it has made me unable to do anything in pursuit of my goals, and the looming feeling of unavoidable failure in my goals (especially due to my port wine stain) has completely overcome me. i feel like anything i do has no impact, and my depression, in combination with my obsession with perfectionism, has me criticizing everything about myself from my inability to take action to any physical attribute i can name about myself. and its so fucking exhausting. and yes, i know i can have my pws removed or lightened, and have been on the fence about whether to pursue that. but whether i like it or not, it is a part of who i am and has shaped how i view the world, and if i became who i want to be in the future without it, i would almost feel like i cheated somehow.* to be honest, i dont know what im asking of this subreddit. support? empathy? advice? to be heard? the only people ive told this to is my close family and therapists, but nothing theyve done has really helped in the larger scope. i know being successful wont cure my depression, but at this point i feel so helpless i dont know what to do. and honestly, i would do anything to accomplish and execute my goals/ideas, because i just cant ever imagine a life in which i drop my dreams. ive just been stuck in the same loop for years. and the weight of the world remains on my shoulders. with no notable progress.",2018-12-27 00:54:22,reversewings,0

a9rypg,"i want to feel again, help me",depression,"i have never been depressed up until this point in my life. last year, i won a scholarship and went to study in a private school in the us for a year(i’m from bulgaria). everything was great there, i felt like i belonged in the us. i travelled a lot - went to la, spent christmas on the beach in palm beach, visited miami. i felt alive and truly felt capable of doing something with my life. when i came back to post-communist bulgaria, the transition period really hit me hard, but i didn’t stress it, i felt good and everything seemed like i was in a holiday: i perceived it on a different level. however, as school began (i’m a senior in high school), i started to look at my surroundings as if they’re not enough, worse than the us. i lost my friends because for a year they’ve moved on and changed utterly. later, my relationships with my relatives suffered because i became very distant. i was applying to us colleges several days in a row. i’d made the mistake to leave everything for several days before the deadline and was getting pretty stressed out. even took a few days off school to focus on my essays. after that was over, anxiety rushed in like an avalanche. i started having panic attacks and became very concerned with my health, often felt like i was dying. and i had been obsessed with working out(probably a year of experience beforehand). i began working out 6 times a week, tracked calories and macros and literally destroyed myself every workout. then actual health problems came: i started feeling extremely fatigued, had heart palpitations and got sick way too often. i had hematuria (was peeing blood) and immediately got checked. it turned out it was due the pressure my kidneys were under, the high protein diet and my abdomen literally squeezing them. nothing irreversible, but i though i was dying to the point where i pictured being on hemodialysis and planned my own funeral. i was constantly googling my symptoms.with anxiety, this deep emptiness and feeling of despair followed. i didn’t feel neither sad nor happy, i felt empty. i no longer took pleasure in working out, talking to people, even watching my favorite tv show. that did not bother me, however, the lack of motivation to do anything pissed me off. it went hand in hand with very harsh episodes of derealization/depersonalization - when i looked at myself in the mirror it was as if this was someone else. everything felt surreal, like in a movie. a bad one.now, i’m seeing a therapist, but i don’t see any benefit. i often think about my mental state, how i’m going to go crazy and not realize it. my lack of focus and ability to concentrate and form memories only fuels this. i’m constantly googling every symptom i feel.   my therapist says i have depression, but i don’t think it can be that serious - how can it cause so much physical symptoms? also, there are times where i truly feel happy, my focus is fine and everything seems normal. however, during these episodes i fear going back to my usual state of emptiness. i find myself doing everything out of habit - reading, going to school, working out. ive noticed that when i laugh - i don’t feel anything, i do it solely out of habit. i want to derive pleasure from things i do again. i really do, but how?",2018-12-26 22:19:37,Japan1998,1

a0uz18,"career failure, can't get back to work. lost all motivation.",depression,"last october my girlfriend and i decided we want to move to vermont from nj. this decision was precipitated by me finding out my job was in the process of laying almost everybody off. a good friend at work had the decency my boss lacked and actually told me what was going to happen so i could prepare. thankfully my girlfriend was able to get a new job in vt pretty quickly, and before i was even let go i was able to give my two weeks and suddenly our three to five year plan became a three to five week plan.before moving to vermont i was professionally successful, id been working as a web developer for the previous eight years at a bunch of different jobs. id worked my way up the salary chain and was making great money, doing stuff i enjoyed. i did hate working in nyc, so in a way i viewed the unexpected change at my job as a blessing in disguise to finally make a move id wanted to for a while.my crucial mistake was thinking that my skills had any value or that i could succeed anywhere i went. vermont has been a technical wasteland for me, and i severely overestimated both my skills and the job market where ive moved. every job i have applied to has turned me down and im starting to wonder if i even have the skills that other companies paid me for before. looking at my resume feels like viewing someone elses accomplishments.its been over a year now, and i still havent been able to get back to work. im super thankful for my girlfriend supporting me, she loves me more than anything and im incredibly grateful for both her support and love. but the continued failure at getting a job has weighed on me like a giant boulder i just cant get out from under. the shame and self hatred i feel for my inability to get back to work and pay rent is unbearable. my money has slowly dwindled to almost nothing and im running out of funds to pay bills and other things i cant avoid.this week i got turned down for another job and im just coming up empty when it comes to the motivation i should feel to try harder and double down on getting back to work. instead of studying harder, i just dont want to try anymore because i feel i will only fail. i feel a deep sense of shame and inadequacy because my friends and peers have maintained their success while ive shot myself in both feet, like an idiot. i hate that my parents told me i could do whatever i wanted, it feels like an empty lie told to make themselves feel good about their parenting. i find that i am often angry or bitter at people around me who are happy, a deep sense of jealousy stems from feeling like ill never be able to enjoy the things they do.i used to have drive and motivation to come home from 10hr days and work on side projects, but now with all the time in the world i cant even motivate myself to do any coding at all. i just waste my time on reddit and youtube watching pointless videos about woodworking or travel in japan. for a while i thought i was suicidal, but i dont want to self harm i just want the pain and suffering to end. killing myself would only hurt the people around me that do care, and to be honest i dont want to die i just want an escape from all the poor decisions ive made that have boxed me in.im coming to a point where i have to take any job, maybe even something like mcdoanlds or walmart to just be able to pay some bills and start repaying the debt ive accrued being unemployed. the dream of getting a decent salary with benefits seems totally out of my reach, and things like owning a house or going on vacation seem more like cruel taunts than attainable goals. its incredibly depressing to feel like my career has evaporated and that skills i thought i had are now worthless.i dont know what to do anymore, i feel like i am at the end of my rope. i wish i had the guts to kill myself but instead i just sit here and waste the best years of my life wishing for some moment of clarity that will provide me with some direction and guidance to dig myself out of this hole. but theres no shovel, theres no ladder, and i cant really see the sunlight from the bottom of the hole anymore. all i can seem to do is sit in the dirt and try to remember what it was like before i fucked myself over by pursuing my dream.",2018-11-27 15:45:33,DirtyBirdNJ,1

""yeah.."" ""did you do it on purpose?"" ""yeah.."" ""how bad?"" i didnt say anything but my friend started crying and said ""mom, its bad. really bad"" she asked me if i was suicidal, and i told her no. so she asked me to show her. after i did, she said she was going to call my mom. she put saline and gauze over the cut and said my mom was coming. when my mom came, she asked to see the cut, but i refused. my mom said she was taking me to the hospital, so my friend and her mom hugged me and said they loved me. and we left.when i got to the hospital, i had to awkwardly tell the nurse why i was there and then we waited. i got checked in, and they took me to a room to wait for the doctor. a nurse came in to give me a hospital gown and check the cut. my parents didnt ever see it because i asked them to leave the room. the doctor came to look at the cut, and commented on how deep it was. he talked to my parents about therapy options, and they decided on inpatient. the doctor left to get what he needed for sutures. when he came back, my parents left the room again and he got started on my leg. he was very nice, and he did a great job with the sutures. i ended up with 4 internal and 8 external sutures, as well as glue on a couple other cuts.we waited for a few hours in the room for the unit to say that they could take me. after about 6 hours at the hospital, an ambulance came to take me to the center. it was mandatory transport and my parents werent allowed to drive me. i got there at about 9:30, and had to sign a ton of papers. when i was taken into the unit, i was shown around, and then i had to do a body check and shower before i could sleep.the unit i was in was pretty short-term. average 5-7 days. on the first day, i talked with a therapist to make a treatment plan. basically we talked about what i wanted to work on, and i was given a packet to complete. i also talked with a psychiatrist, and she was pretty great. on the second day, i had to do a family session with my parents. during that, i told them that i was trans, and it went a lot better than i hoped. theyre open to information, which means a lot to me.. i cried a lot during the session, but thats okay.so, now im on strattera and lexapro. im also set up with the psychiatrist i talked to and a therapist. the sudden decrease in stress combined with the new meds is making me exhausted. the strattera makes me look stoned, though.so, yeah. if anyone has questions, ill try to answer.",2017-07-29 19:33:14,Kiekis,0

a616sf,lingering problems after moving,offmychest,"i’ve had a long mental battle with myself starting in april when i moved in from my biological grandmother’s house to another house with step-family and mom. my step family was just my step-dad and his mother sadly with dementia, who is stressful for me, even though i don’t have to really take care of her. i remember the very night i did, changing my life forever. no other day changed my life than me moving. it was around april 5-7 when i was at my cousin’s wedding (dad’s side). my mom called asking me to come help move, whereas i did not want to, and wanted to stay with my cousins. i had to so my dad took me to the new house where i was moving in with my mom and step family (just 2 of them, so there are 4 of us).  it was my step-dad and his mother. i’ll try not to get into to much of it, but i didn’t feel comfortable there. i wasn’t abused or anything, i just didn’t feel comfortable.these are the following things i experienced after moving.i felt like my life changed the minute i walked in there. from there, life was at first awkward and went downhill for me. it’s probably a form of relocation depression. i began to question myself, “am i having fun with life”. i thought of that every single day from then. my thoughts turned into feeling just emotionally dull and whatsoever. the only place i felt great at was at school, where my thoughts barely bothered me at all, but when coming to my new house, my day just went down. at this point it wasn’t terrible, yet.around may-june i began going to bed at much later times on school nights, just wondering why am i even alive. honestly, i even wanted to be ‘shot’ so i could really feel something. i would be okay living, just feeling like i just “exist” and that there’s nothing special to my life. basically as time went on, i became more confused with my thoughts. especially during july-august where i really did see the world differently. i would always ask myself “am i happy?” “am i having fun?” and then would be dragged down by these thoughts. my thoughts truly did overcome me. i recall having an anxiety attack where i could not sit down, thinking something terrible was bound to happen to me or my mother, and also having mentally crushing moments thinking life is unlivable. i was hoping my problems would go away when i entered sophomore year as i’d be more occupied, since i am an introvert. it did, but i always keep thinking and questioning myself during school. i would go home, sometimes in bed feeling helpless or just empty. i felt like if my life wasn’t put together by december or january (it was september or october) at the time that i wouldn’t know where my life would go and feared for it. once i talked to my close cousin and dad about my problems and thoughts around november  and started journaling my thoughts, my problems became better in a way. i learned to stay true to myself, and just remember that my life was not like this before i moved. i’ve dealt with mental health issues in the past, so this is where i get my strength from. thank god i didn’t try to hurt myself or anything these past months, despite my thoughts of life being “unfun” overcoming me. with my bothersome thoughts life truly became different for me. i tried too hard to enjoy life such as just watching the sun set, and instead i just felt bad about myself when i tried too hard to enjoy life. it was like i had to go out of my way to get more sleep to not be depressed. i remember one night about a month ago, it snowed for the first time since last february. i was just on the phone with my close cousin, talking, having fun. then that night i remember listening to music, and crying, since i have been trying to force myself to cry out my feelings. for thanksgiving i almost cried in front of my actual family who i really missed, as to where i had to turn from everyone. even when my step-dad and his mom came in i started thinking about my usual repetitive thoughts. that night i went to my cousins’ for the weekend, having real fun that time without my thoughts affecting me as much as they usually.fast-forward from thanksgiving to last saturday, i remember setting up my christmas tree and truly being happy. i always have looked forward to the winter months and christmas. i probably have reverse seasonal affective disorder lol. but from there my thoughts rarely appear in my head for me, and i can feel just happy and fine without worrying if i really do. i feel so happy now, my life is going upwards now and i hope it gets better.sorry if this is a mess, guys, but any feedback, statements, advice, questions, or whatever you have to say will be appreciated.

a9l9ng,a drug addict struggling to avoid hitting rock bottom and experiencing a fake happy christmas,depression,"im a recovering drug addict and floor the past year everything seemed great from the outside. i got a great job and a nice apartment. but the past few months ive been miserable art my job and hate my roommate. so i started using up all my paid time off from work and getting high. well the day i get back from using all my pto i get fired . which i was actually happy about but because i blew my whole i have to do day labor to pay my rent which is find. anyways my mom begged to me to stay at her house the past few days so id be safe and around for christmas and i agreed. i did relapse though and she was mad and saying things like ""jyst od and get it over with""and ""maybe tonight will bee the night you die in the gutter and this will all be over"". i tried not to take it to hard because i know how hurt and disappointed she is but ive been feeling suicidal lately and it just doesnt help. her brother and my cousin who she raised killed themself choose to christmas and my other cousin was killed near christmas so she hates dec. and youd think shed be extra aware of saying things like that this tone of year especially when she already knows im struggling with addiction and depression. we get past it and im just hanging out ave wanted to be close because its easier to stay sober when im here and not at my apartment isolated. for tiger past few days shes been extra nice and everything was looking up but as soon as we leave christmas dinner she starts attacking me verbally and totally changes up. this post makes her seem colder and more unmotherly than she really is but right now im sitting on her porch debating if i should go home or stay throughout the week like we planned. normally i love being alone but with everything going on with me i have a feeling something bad will happen if i go home. i told her i was leaving ave she just said good which makes me not want to try to turn things around and jyst give up even more. im just lost and figured id reach out and get a different perspective before i decide what to do. im totality indifferent to whether i live or die but was sticking around for her but if im making her life so miserable and she doesnt want me around anyway whats the point.

a9l78q,"i found out of my depression, i think. but now im so sad.",depression,"after 30 years of depression, 15 of witch i was on medication, i decide last year that fuck it. therapy had its chance, prescription drugs had their chance. ill give drugs a try.but let me step back. of course i had a history of self medicating already. i abused cannabis for 15 years of my life, and it worsened my psychology to the point of me being hospitalized.i got diagnosed and found quite insane, suffering from personality disorders and a wrecked sense of my own worth. this was 10 years ago. since then i was in recovery, with ultimately me now working, very happy but poor as fuck, in a workspace for persons with psychological disabilities.earlier this year i learned that opposed to what i always thought, i actually did have acces to quite strong psychedelics. you see. i dont have much social life. i dont know any dealers. neither do i want to. i just learned i do not need dealers. i just need knowledge.these substances always interested me. i suffer from a mental disability, i have no visual imagination. the idea of tripping and seing things always fascinated me.now, to keep it short, i studied, i tried. i healed, i left behind and transcended many of my disabilities.&#x200b;the long and short of it of it all was, that i understood that the core of my depression was an early deep traumatization that taught me how to suppress my emotions, (with the exception of anger). it kept me going, it was necessary. yes; it kept me going for a while. but  it also almost killed me.i understood this, knew this. i felt it, and i was able to reach the decision to let it go.&#x200b;&#x200b;but it left me so vulnerable. it seems i am a person with greatly increased sensitivity. if i listen sad music i get really sad. if i listen to happy music i get really happy. the ode to joy can trigger a mania in me.since i changed, i am subject to heavy mood swings. i fall madly in love with girls that are in relations. i  am in euphoria for a month. right now i am in a phase of deep sadness. i feel like crying all the time.i do not know at this point if i am more sane now or more crazy then before. i am differently crazy, that much is certain.and no, i do not want it back. sadness is not depression. being sure of my emotions, being able to identify and relate with my own mood, this pice of mind  i have now, these glimpses of happiness i sometimes feel: these things are so valuable and so beautiful.but i am in a difficult spot. my poverty sometimes feels like killing me and i do not see a way out. i did not care for so long and now it simply could be to late.my emotions feel like its all to much at times. it feels like i should have learned to deal with what i feel now at a much younger age, but at that age, i simply could not. my adult mind now struggles to adjust.dmt helps me greatly by softening my psychology and allowing me to reform parts of my personality. but there is only so much dmt i can do without going nuts. plus, if i overdo it, my body starts rejecting iti do not even know why i write this up. i think doing so, writing it up, allowing others to read it might help me to accept it better. maybe one of you might have some insight to share. i am grateful for any advise, even for advise i can not follow.",2018-12-26 05:51:53,motorbit,1
a9l4qx,i can’t tell you why i feel this way,depression,i’m laying in bed right now crying not understanding why and just wanting this pain to go away. i wish getting out of bed was easy. i wish you couldn’t tell by looking at my face that somethings wrong. i’m tired of being told “angellovely1 smile!” i can’t tell you why i’m depressed or if today was better than yesterday. everything is blurred together. i just want to feel human. i want this weight off my shoulders. ,2018-12-26 05:41:46,AngelLovely1,1
