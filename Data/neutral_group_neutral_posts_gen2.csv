al2foi,"why are instagram meme pages created by such entitled, two dimensional people that think they're unique?",4.0,1.0,104.0,Infuriating,"without giving too much away, there's a meme gang war for meme pages that parody the current building i go to, on the surface it seems normal.

all 3 pages just embody the worst types of meme pages.

page 1 is an edgy meme page that'd make the damn daniel meme look like it came from /b/. all it is, is a collection of uncomfortably salty and very graphic memes that'd go against instagram's tos if somebody bothered to report it. the person themselves is a salt shaker that has a passive aggressive attitude against the other meme pages and a vendetta against the rival building, they basically assume anyone that calls their saltiness out is a ""loser from that building."" and that's pretty much the limit of their creativity.

page 2 is essentially if watchmojo was a meme page that got salty at any meme pages that could rival it. it was a pretty gross sight of stolen reddit memes made to ""relate"" (pander) to it's followers. very quiet on the  other pages.

the last one is tame in comparison, but the level of projection through reliance of validation through their memes was very aggressive and they just started copying page 1.

the people that typically make these jokes and follow these pages, are also the ones that think it's okay to be homophobic behind their teacher's back but playthe race card when somebody doesn't accept their passive aggressive bitchiness sitting down.

i have been that person that has spoken up to the jerks that try to call me a stuck up bitch right in front of me, all because i ask them to not destroy my equipment after they borrow it.

i don't know if a cornucopia of judgey jerks in 1 room is a norm or not. i would like to know.",47.0,11.0,0.86,2019-01-29 19:37:59,BloopyStoopy,0.0,0.0,16.0,1673.0,305.0
ahynjv,"i'm not mad, just hurt",1.0,1.0,22.0,Vent,"tl;dr lifelong friend is a wolf in sheep's clothing that seems mentally vunerable but is actually a really bad person on the inside, that tried to seperate me from the bestest friend i've ever made in my life.

known her ever since we were 4. she had a habit of grouping with all the really popular girls and leaving me alone, we mainly bonded because we both had learning difficulties and our parents were friends. i learned to stop being so trusting of people just because of mental difficulties.

cut to highschool, she befriends my bully for 3 years and always picked her over me saying ""i need rescuing from her"" and only actually left when the bully blackmailed her. i did put my head down during this time, resulting in respect from most of my teachers (especially the one i look up to the most) and i now have basic photography as a hobby.

parents warned me about how it seemed bad that i'd always pay on days out (was always paranoid about losing a friend so i tried to be perfect constantly). i shrugged it off and basically spoiled her. i learned to alwaysbe cautious about friends that lets you sorely organise and host days out.

towards the end of the year, tensions arose. she'd make very alarming comments like ""you think you're so smart, don't you?"" and ""wow, girls would envy you"". the first was made in maths because we'd get a little competitive and i somehow managed to get a majority of questions right, but that's mainly because i actually like school and found it fun. i shrugged off the latter because i still don't see myself as anything above a 3/10. i try my best to regularly improve my self confidence and i believe that entering uni life and meeting more people like me, will help.

i should've cut her off when she hit me with a wii remote during mario party 8 (i'm not even that good at the game), or when she cancelled on fully planned days out after i text her asking why she was over half an hour late, or when she told me to stay put on a street across from a creepy guy while she got ready and then forgot i was there after i texted and called her when the guy started walking towards me. towards spring, i just chose to carryon by myself and have a blast during days out.

decided during the summer that i had enough and texted her. she locked herselfi n the bathroom and threatened suicide if i didn't befriend her again. my face was red and swollen with tears when she came over after asking ""cool, can we hang out now?"" over the phone. she looked like she was pushing up daisies. i stopped pitying people like that.

first year of college was a mixed bag: made an awesome best friend, but my ex friend plainly avoided me and sent off her new mates to give me her birthday presents, all of which were things that she knew i'd dislike a lot and even the new mates did a better job of spotting what i liked when they decided to show me that she bought the gifts last minute (the day after my birthday) from cheap stores near the college. the new best friend was amazing and we even dated temporarily, but decided that we were strongest as best friends.

second year i approached her, she blamed it on depression, i gave her another chance. she becomes antagonistic towards my new best friend, tried to split us up during squabbles by escalating things through meddling. the last time we hung out was when she was being out of character clingy and driving my friend away through both of them arguing with me sandwiched in the middle and being tugged by both sides, i straight up walked away from the situation because i couldn't handle it. it was my new best friend that actively pursued me, comforted me and apologised for the bickering. i've always trusted my new best friend from then on.

got back in contact with a friend of ex friend, gave off the sane vibes so i was cautious about her intentions. she didn't reply for 3 weeks after saying ""i'm having a no phone weekend, will totally say hi at monday"". friends that only wanna text and lie about why they can't talk=what i avoid.

she goes ghost on me, saw her omw home and she seemed awkward about it. 3 long b.s. texts about anxiety and ""it's not you, it's me"". the friend of the ex friend was even more toxic and clued me in to how ex friend was telling everyone that i forced people to do things they didn't want to and i was a bossy and toxic person. i didn't take this personally because this girl saw bossy as ""i'm disappointed that you cancelled last minute on things"". it's harder to blame myself for everything after hearing her spreading rumours.

last i saw her was when i was knitting a blanket in college when waiting for my sister to arrive to her college interview (love knitting so much i do it almost anywhere), saw an old classmate talking to ex friend and decided i'd wave at her. she was gesturing to ex friend but ex friend deliberately didn't turn around and started whispering to her, i could tell it was gossip about me cause they were looking at me with gawked expressions, and they both scurried off. i no longer pity her or think i had any massive part in ruining our friendship, she decided to hang out with girls that hate me and gossip about me and scurry with her tail between her legs. damming evidence that she knew what she did.

turns out the worst of the highschool girl gangs formed a clan and they were the primary scource of rumours circulating that i was a ""whore"" (i call myself a 3/10 because all the boys in highschool saw me as abnormal, how was i pulling according to them!?) and she was their primary scource. she also still swoons over the popular guy despite her being 18, knowing nothing about him and him not knowing about her existence. just goes to show that some people wanna relive the glory days of highschool where their actions are justified and they don't need to grow up. i found my best friend that day at lunch and we just happily bought our chicken and proceeded as normal.

idc who she spreads the rumours to, i'm not even going to the college gala because my best friend (only friend) is busy that day and i'd rather not see my old jerk classmates after they hear the stories she spins. it feels better to know that at most, i was worried about what i did to hurt her, and i'm not the one doing a smear campaign. 

my new best friend is awesome and is actually the one who helped peer review my story cause i'm new. it was always on my bucket list to make a good best friend, and i've succeeded!

just wished it never happened, we were close despite all the bad things, maybe i'm still naive and maybe she was just pandering to me. either way, i won't be able to truly ignore her until we both graduate and do different courses in hopefully different universities...",47.0,11.0,1.0,2019-01-20 17:39:13,BloopyStoopy,0.0,0.0,5.0,6728.0,1252.0

9vdpvr,my shitty idea for a vi rework,0.0,4.0,30.0,leagueoflegends,"people were talking about vi being a shitty camille in another thread. so, i got to thinking about how to give vi her own personality.

1) there aren't really any elements of vi's kit that are unique. malphite has her passive, a bunch of different champions have things similar to her q (j4 flag-drag, last part of hec e), vayne has her w, her e is literally just a titanic proc, and her ult is basically camille ult, noc ult activation, and kai'sa ult, mashed together.

2) no matter what she does, someone else does her job better. other people farm better, protect their carry better, kill the other carry better, scrap better, etc. so i want to make her the best at *something*.

alright, let's do it.

* * *

passive: swat armor

this is basically just her current passive, but with a more supportive component. she gets a shield when she hits a unit with an ability, scaling with health, with a copy of the shield given to a nearby ally champion if one is in range. this will encourage her to stay near her team - her adc specifically - and make group plays, rather than just running in.

* * *

q: miranda rights

a rework of her current q. has a shorter range, but no cast time. does much less damage, but also applies a damage reduction debuff to whoever she hits that lasts for a bit. i want this to be a good tool for protecting the carry, as well as getting over walls in the jungle. it will suck as an initiation tool due to its short range, but i don't want her initiating with a supporting tool. keep the tiny knockback, i like that part.

* * *

w: warrantless entry

reworking her w, with both a passive and an active component.

passive: every 3rd hit, does a percentage of the target's health in physical damage. this damage is doubled against buffs, and tripled against rift herald, dragons, and turrets. one of vi's strengths has always been taking objectives, i think this should stay as part of her characterization, that she goes through things quickly. this damage could potentially scale with the sum of armor and magic resist, but i'm not too invested in anything in particular.

active: there are weak spots placed in the walls all around summoner's rift. on a long cooldown, maybe two minutes or so, vi can destroy these walls and allow both teams to walk through them, but only her team to see through them.

* * *

e: 10-31, over

i just want to give her a tool for clearing the jungle, as well as something to make her ganks a little bit better. for a few seconds, vi is granted bonus ms towards nearby enemy champions, as well as bonus attack speed, and an on-hit slow if there is a nearby ally champion.

* * *

r: this is the police

vi channels for a bit, and then charges forward. sort of a mix of kled and sion ults, as well as aurelion sol e. during this time, she goes through walls, and can reactivate the ability to stop, at which point she stops moving. if not, she continues going until she hits an enemy champion head-on, or reaches max range. in the latter case, she stops. in the former case, she does the traditional vi ult - pulling them into the air, doing damage, etc. if an enemy champion is hit with a glancing blow, they are knocked to the side. whether or not she can change direction tbd, if allies can follow her over walls tbd, but her allies also get a speed boost to follow along with her.

9lzy1a,"the ancient canaanite god ""el""",18.0,3.0,30.0,satanism,"i've been reading up on mythology for a little while, and there's something i find fascinating about the very oldest parts of judaism.

we refer to god on a relatively frequent basis as ""adonai eloheinu melech ha'olam,"" or ""the lord our god, ruler of the universe."" other times, he'll just be called ""adonai,"" translated as ""lord,"" and there are a slew of other names.

there is an ancient god that appears in a number of pantheons in the region, named el. el was the chief god, husband of asherah, and the father of hadad, yam, and mot. what's interesting is that these three children were similar to zeus, poseidon, and hades in many ways, making el roughly analogous to kronos. like kronos, el used a sickle to slay his own father, who was sky.

now, back in ye olden days, mystery cults were a thing, where a group from a polytheistic religion would split off, and worship just one god specially. it's known that, about 3,000 years ago, there was a slow migration by former slaves from egypt into the mountains of canaan, where there was a mystery cult devoted to el.

now, here's where the story gets really interesting. in the oldest parts of the tanakh, you get god referred to as ""elohim,"" which, notably, is a plural. you get god referred to as ""el elyon"" and ""el shaddai."" meanwhile, one of the names of el was ""adon ilim,"" which is extremely close to ""adonai elohim.""

at the end of it all, the part that most interests me is the context that it puts the character of the god of the old testament in. as a jew, i've long since acknowledged the new testament as a sub-par work of fanfiction, and - although it is still purely a work of fiction - the old testament was more interesting and nuanced, both in its subject matter and its interpretation.

look at the first commandment, ""you shall have no other gods before me."" he doesn't say besides or after. he distinctly leaves open the possibility that other gods are fucking around somewhere, just that's he's head honcho. look at how he behaves. it's much more in line with characters like kronos, who ate his own children, and the mycenaen version of dionysus, who would've inspired lovecraft had he been familiar. his behavior is significantly different from the ever-jovial romanized jupiter, or the fat drunk bacchus, or the far more paternal saturn. 

that's the heart of it, then. that adonai, the god of a people literally named ""those who fought with god,"" yis-ra-el, is a holdover from when mythologies were chaotic, and cruel, and random, and the world didn't care about people, and we died young in small, pointless squabbles over hills. our patriarchs told him to fuck off on a frequent basis, because he was being a dickhead, and we knew he was being a dickhead, because it would take a dickhead to make the world that we're in.

the therapist thinks for a moment, considers the patient, the state that he's in. maybe he should get outside, maybe he just needs to laugh for a bit. clear his head for a little while, so that he can see beyond the fog in his mind, glimpse the things that make life worth living, and walk towards them. so he says;

""sir, you are truly depressed, it seems. you need to go outside for a little while, laugh for a bit. brighten your spirits, if only for a moment. then you can see why life is worth living, which i assure you it is. you know what? there's a theater in town, and this weekend it just so happens that the great stand-up pagliacci is performing there. so go, laugh a bit, and see me the day after.""

9g7lex,shitposting tier system,17.0,3.0,23.0,UIUC,"alright chucklefucks, here it goes.

i propose a tier system for shitposts. both as a method of classification for sociological study, and as a meta shitpost in and of itself. shitposts will be considered higher tier as they achieve greater comedic and social effect.

f-tier:

an f-tier shitpost is defined by its complete failure to function as a shitpost. it will contain jokes in poor taste, or be so close to a normal post that its status as a shitpost is completely ignored. as an example of an f-tier shitpost, see [youtube's attempt at having a sassy corporate account](https://i.redditmedia.com/w8onvidi8rw9y3lxdzqfnv4uo-1xkkcgmfrj3izzldk.jpg?w=1024&s=0c43450a35fc2d7b97877ee0ecd40596). this is a shitpost because it communicates nothing of value, is an attempt at humor, and falls flat to the point of offending decency.

d-tier:

a d-tier shitpost is defined by its laziness of construction, and its poor quality as a result. a quality shitpost requires thought, cultural context, and a sense of humor in order to shine brightly. a d-tier shitpost is just... dumb. doesn't present anything new. hell, it barely presents anything that's old. for an example, see [this attempt to be the new uiuc mascot](https://imgur.com/npkjdp0). it's just dumb. ""hurr durr, i'm in an alien costume, trotting out a meme so stale that, were it bread, could be used as a cutting implement.""

c-tier:

a c-tier shitpost is defined by the fact that it does its job. gets a disappointed glare from the people who glare disappointedly at things, and gets a chuckle from the people who chuckle at the things that other people find disappointing. like a well-told anti-joke, or an off-the-cuff pun. it is the packing peanut of content aggregation. it should be there, so that people don't leave in droves, but lets the actually good material shine through. for an example of a c-tier shitpost, see [the eternally reposted ""sleeping nun"" joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes/comments/7iap89/what_do_you_call_a_sleepwalking_nun/). it's funny...ish, and to a point.

b-tier:

a b-tier shitpost clearly had some thought put into it. it is original, but not the point of breaking ground. it is the 5-page undergraduate research paper of shitposts. not an honors credit project, or a master's thesis, and certainly not a dissertation. this gets a laugh from the people who see it, but don't expect them to laugh longer than it takes to scroll away, or to think about it ever again. for an example of a b-tier shitpost, see [one of the later meta-rant posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/uiuc/comments/9fwgcb/ranting_rant/). it's funny, it's relevant, and that's the best that can really be said of it.

a-tier:

an a-tier shitpost is a quality shitpost. plenty of bran was involved, and deserves a polite gold-clap for the effort. this can include everything from impressively shitty logic to the mathematics of the absurd. it is characterized by the effort that went into it, despite the inherent worthlessness of the subject matter. entire parodies of songs to stories written with the sole purpose of making you wrinkle your forehead as hard as humanly possible. as an example, see [this quality greentext](https://i.imgur.com/nsg2oqn.jpg). it's funny, it's nuanced, it has a beginning and ending. consuming it has some sort of payoff. the only issue is that it is, fundamentally, forgettable. it will be laughed at while it's there, shown to friends and family - for a particularly weird family - and then fade from memory until it is specifically mentioned.

s-tier:

an s-tier shitpost transcends the normal shitpost. it helps to define the zeitgeist. it takes passion. it takes intelligence. it takes effort. it can be anything from the first instance of a [legendary copypasta](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/to-be-fair-you-have-to-have-a-very-high-iq-to-understand-rick-and-morty), to a [rousing call for change](https://www.reddit.com/r/grilledcheese/comments/2or1p3/you_people_make_me_sick/). it can take the form of a [body of work](https://www.reddit.com/user/rogersimon10), to a [work of pure artistry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4feusts21-8). on a fundamental level, the s-tier shitpost differs in that it is remembered by the community in which it was posted, and often even by those outside the community.  

that is my shitpost tier list. i acknowledge, even before criticisms are given, that there are perfectly valid criticisms to be made. i suspect that my feelings on these tiers will change easily as better arguments are presented than those i have thus-far considered.",289469.0,9507.0,0.73,2018-09-16 06:32:21,MrAcurite,0.0,0.0,3.0,4577.0,683.0

you request a trade with the bot via a website. you come to my server, my bot goes to keys, you give the bot a few items, bot stores it in the vault. now, using math, i've come up with numerical values for every item in the game, stored as a decimal number. for example, a def pot would have a value of ""1.000"" and a dex pot would have a value of ""0.243"" or something. anyway, my bot adds 95% of the value of the item to an account in your character's name. then, when you go to buy an item - if you can afford it -  100% of the value of the item is charged to your account, my bot pulls it from storage, and trades it to you.

the 95%/100% thing is to allow for items to slowly build up, so that when someone wants to actually buy an item, there's any chance at all that i'll have it.

i'm doing this to skirt all the issues with a barter economy. if you want to try and buy a bunch of automata eggs with a mana pot, or just store value outside of your vault, this will let you do it.

1) we're gonna knock down the buildings around the morrill plots, and return them to their former glory. make illinois corn again.

2) every sports team will remain known as the ""fighting illini,"" except the wrestling team, who will now be known as the ""loving illini,"" and any team more than 50% las majors will be renamed ""pugillatory sioux."" 

3) all asian students will be given permanent, uiuc-funded vouchers to ride suburban express wherever the hell they like, just because it will probably annoy dennis.

4) in order to decrease tuition costs, professors will now share housing with the undergraduate students, rather than paying for their own houses. have fun having a 60-year-old phd explain the etymology of the word ""snickerdoodle"" at 2 am.

5) we will build a wall along the illinois/indiana border, and make purdue pay for it.

6) we will kick rutgers out of the big ten. i don't know why, i just want to.

7) the engineering college will work alongside the athletic department, in order to transform the sports teams into a terrifying breed of cyber-athletes.

8) we will make ""university of illinois at urbana-champaign"" synonymous with ""university of illinois,"" and as such the chicago campus will be renamed ""university of illinois at urbana-champaign at chicago,"" or ""uiucc"" for short.

9) uiucc will be suing iupui for the title of ""dumbest university name acronym"".

10) the new college of medicine will be required to install bioaugmentations in all uiuc students, faculty, and alumni free of charge, whenever they become a thing. i'm calling dibs on laser eyes.

11) ikenberry dining will be required to distribute its four-cheese pizza to all the other dining halls.

12) we're annexing umich.

(it probably doesn't help that where we are in the country tends to be dominated with flight/freeze types all over the place.) so, for the past few months, he feels he's sunk into a depression. along with this, he says he has lost all physical attraction/sexual interest in me. as heartbreaking as this is for me, i'm thinking this might be more due to him having untreated c-ptsd re: his unhealthy use of workaholism as a coping mechanism. he's agreed to go to individual counseling for this and we're going to continue with couples counseling to work on building healthy ways of resolving conflicts. am i delusional in thinking that his depression/loss of attraction/loss of sexual interest could be more of a dissociation related to his past trauma? has anyone here had similar experience in long-term relationships? how has your c-ptsd effected your ability to connect on a deep, intimate level with a so?

&#x200b;

**a little background on us:** together romantically for 10+ years and work friends for 1.5 years prior to dating; i am his first healthy romantic relationship; both of us suffered severe childhood abuse for the first two decades of our lives; i have gone to individual counseling and am 4+ years into recovery for my c-ptsd (i'm more of a freeze/dissociate type with some flight in me); he has not had any individual counseling and doesn't believe his trauma effects his ability to be emotionally intimate, etc.; we are in couple's counseling at the moment.

**signs of c-ptsd in him:** he rarely, if ever cries or is able to cry when he is upset; he very often cannot identify an emotion and/or says he ""feels nothing"" when he is showing physical signs of being upset (like muscle tightness, tone of voice change, etc.); fits the flight/freeze hybrid description with video games being is dissociative activity; shows the pattern of cyclothymetic two-step with emphases on flight; has imposter-syndrome/inner critic; uses his outer critic toward people at work and me when it comes to not cleaning/decluttering (when plenty of the clutter is his too).

8n5iow,[discussion] what dog breeds make good emotional support dogs?,1.0,4.0,62.0,dogs,"i don't have any severe problems that require a service dog, but i get stressed out and down on myself often and fairly easily. i always feel better with animals, but especially the ones that seem to know you're upset and will try to cuddle you or make you feel better some how. 

i plan on adopting so i probably won't get a pure breed, but i figured it would be good to know which dogs may have a tendency to be extra loving during hard times since that's not something you can really see in a dog during the adoption process. 

edit: i'd fill out the dog breed quiz in the sidebar, but i'm honestly willing and capable of caring for any dog. i've owned multiple dogs at a time my whole life in the house i live in/grew up in and they've all been happy and healthy. from 13lbs to 120lbs, two with extremely thick fluffy fur that required constant brushing, cutting, or shaving, ones that just want to sleep to ones that never stop moving, etc. any dog breed is fine i'm just asking which tend to have this one trait!

i live in an apartment right next to a park where i would be happy to walk my dog at least 30min-1hr a day, but other than that it is still an apartment and i'm a student who spends a lot of time doing nothing but sitting around studying. i know i can care for a dog properly, but i want to make sure i get a dog who is happy just laying around and cuddling because i can't offer hours of fetch or a backyard just yet.

basically, i want a dog that's super clingy. i've had about 4 dogs growing up and my heart is so full when they just want to stand so close they're tripping you and snuggle closer until they're pushing you off the bed. i know this isn't for everyone cause it would drive my parents crazy but i would absolutely feel blessed to have something loving me so much it feels the need to sit on my foot while i'm trying to cook. likewise, if always feel sad when my dog seemed to want nothing to do with my hugs and only accepted pets. i'm very affectionate and i just have always clicked better with animals that are also affectionate. i know what i'm getting into with a super clingy dogs, but it's something i definitely am sure i want.

aejpos,2019 started off so well but now i'm already unraveling,3.0,0.0,55.0,ptsd,"tl;dr: i feel as though i'm unraveling after a hiccup even though everything was going well. i could use help brainstorming some extra coping ideas.

i've had a really tough 3 years. bipolar disorder full on onset. repeat of childhood traumas, and lots of family drama as i've been coming out.

2018 i made so much progress. emdr worked really well even though it was tough, i got ect which really stabilized the mood disorder, and my relationship flourished. oh and i finally went back to work!

third week of january is always the worst and it's coming rapidly but i felt prepared. the anniversary of two of my incidents are then and i felt positive about it this year (no 3-month stint in the psych ward for me is the plan!).

then, something happened with family's finances and i need to sell my house to help. seems simple, but that simple thing terrifies me and is now bringing me over the edge. last night i woke up every hour during the night running through the room screaming about snakes and asking the empty room if they were seeing any. i had to turn on all my lights to get some fleeting sleep. but ended up just giving up sleeping after a while. i took out my weighted blanket to help me relax a little while just lying on the couch.

i think i just have one too many things. house, family relationships strained, job is stressful all leading up to this awful anniversary that i kind get out of my mind. i'm considering breaking out the klonopin which i have avoided for a year now, or just taking a bit of sick leave, or trying to find someone to handle the stressful bits about the house.

i've tried all the usual suspects in the last few days, cold showers, music, favorite shows, exercise.

i don't want to lose myself again. and i feel on the brink.

i think i've learned that even when it's all going great i shouldn't pressure myself too much as it only takes one issue to go over the edge.

6jh7yi,[help] adopted an agressive dog from a friend,0.0,8.0,45.0,dogs,"so a little back story. a couple of years ago my friend got a puppy. at about 6 months old the dog ate a spoiled piece of meat it found out side. this resulted in food poisoning and a fever that got so high for so long that tje vet was sure he would die. he survived but the vet indicated he had brain damage from the fever. 
fast forward two years the dog has some pretty bad aggression issues. due in part to brain damage and bullying from another dog and lack of appropriate handling. my friend was about ready to put him down to the aggression issues so i took him to see what i could do. i am not an inexperienced dog owner, i have had them all my life and currently he is one of three dogs. i have had him about two months and dont know what to with him. he is still aggressive with my 11 yr old basset. after two months he still randomly barks growls at my younger (21 yr old) brother. he can not be picked up or moved. i have almost been bitten twice in the last 24hrs. at this point om scarred to do anything with him. i dont feel i can take him to the groomers, or the vet, or even the park for fear he will bite someone. im honestly at my wits end and have no idea what to do woth him. ive had dogs with behavioural problems before but nothing like this. at this point, much as i hate to do it, i am considering surrendering him to the pound before someone gets hurt. can i salvage this thing? will he ever be ""safe""? any and all advise would be appreciated.",3735.0,682.0,0.33,2017-06-26 01:33:03,thewarmongeringgnome,0.0,0.0,8.0,1469.0,296.0

ak99po,is it possible that lg slows their old phones down via software like apple did/does?,2.0,4.0,84.0,techsupport,"this is not so much a tech support request, but more of an inquiry to those who know about android smartphones, lg versions in particular.

my family took advantage of a carrier deal 2 years ago and purchased four lg-v20 smartphones on the same day. we are on verizon wireless. all 4 phones are updated to the most recent android version that was made available on verizon for these phones, 8.0.0. they are all on october 1, 2018 security patch level. software version vs99520c. build number opr1.170623.032. kernal version 3.18.71-perf+lge@android-build.

virtually exactly all 4 phones started having software issues at the exact same time. i never would have noticed if we all didn't have the same phones. we all use our phones differently as well, one is primarily used just for talk and text, one is primarily used for social media and some text, one is used mostly for texting and photography, and one is used for mostly talk and photography. they also all have varying amounts of apps installed, one is essentially completely stock and used as just a phone. and another has tons of apps. 

all 4 started lagging. home button lag. camera open lag. camera shutter lag. home screen scroll lag. app open lag. boot up lag. screenshot lag. weird errors, like ""home has stopped working"", and ""second screen has stopped working"". lots of random restarts became necessary. loading and switching tabs in chrome has become extremely slow. battery life seems to have plummeted faster than usual. apps freeze. 

these problems did not coincide with an operating system update, or a security patch, or even a new app install. the only thing that they seem to correspond to is approximately the same time since they were activated. it made me wonder if lg is pulling some kind of apple-esque software slowdown to coincide with the release of new models and the end of support for the older models? 

any ideas?

i would have a scene set in a seedy sports bar. at the pool tables.

""bullshit!"" we hear from someone whose back is turned to us. then we see the person snap a pool stick like a toothpick. 

still facing backwards to our perspective, the person reaches over and resets the same pool ball configuration, and slaps 100 bucks on the table. ""no one could make that shot. prove me wrong.""

a hooded man in blue shaded sunglasses quietly seated at the bar walks over, briefly checks out the non-broken pool sticks, then steps up to the side of the table.

the perspective changes and we see that the hooded sunglass wearing man is tony stark. we see through his f.r.i.d.a.y. enabled heads up glasses that the perfect angle and force are projected directly over the pool table, from tony's perspective. of course, the ball makes 3 or 4 side deflections and sinks the target ball, and 2 others.

we hear a snarl. tony takes his glasses off and pushes back the hoodie, then slaps the still unknown man on the shoulder, ""don't worry big guy, i'll be honest, i cheated.""

the camera finally swings around. it's logan/wolverine. ""stark, i know exactly why you're here. you people don't seem to understand what 'retired' means.""

""logan, we have our hands pretty full, and could really use your help on this one. specifically your freakish strength and insane healing.

[thegww.com](https://thegww.com/doom-patrol-episode-one-review/)

>the first episode of doom patrol is easily one of the greatest pieces of comic book television ever made. the writing is nothing short of stellar and the cast deliver excellent performances, specifically diane guerrero (crazy jane) and brendan fraser (robotman). 

>the show also excels at its dive into the psychological effects superpowers can have on someone. negative man deals with anxiety, robotman deals with depression, and jane deals with a dissociative identity disorder. like it’s predecessor titans, doom patrol is filled with tragedy and heartbreak, but it’s handled much better here. the characters have more depth and nothing feels forced, which helps make them a lot more relatable. fraser’s robotman is the heart of the series, with most of it told from his perspective. robotman is used to open up the opportunities to find out the origins of the other characters as well, which all show that each of them have just as many flaws as they do strengths. the goal of this was obviously to show that these “heroes” aren’t necessarily the heroes we’re used to, but due to the many other superhero shows currently going on, it doesn’t come off like that. if it wasn’t for the many twists and turns, it would feel generic.

>the vfx in the show is another highlight. one of jane’s personalities is a giant with a flaming ball of fire for a head, and it looks fantastic. negative man’s negative spirit also looked amazing, as did the villainous mr. nobody, who is shockingly comic accurate. speaking of nobody, alan tudyk isn’t only the villain, but the narrator of the show as well. his voice and tone are great and provide some of the funniest and sarcastically dark dialogue in any comic book adaptation. diane guerrero does a phenomenal job differentiating between jane’s personalities and it really shows how diverse an actress she is. while he doesn’t have a large role in the first episode, timothy dalton (the chief) has a strong onscreen presence and is a high point of the first episode. april bowlby (elasti-woman) is good as well and will hopefully be given more screen time as the season goes on. matt bomer was another impressive cast member who shined during humorous and light moments.

>overall, the first episode is a fantastic start to what is going to be an even better show and i can’t wait to watch more! - ***9.5/10***

[collider.com](http://collider.com/doom-patrol-review/)

>it was about the time i saw brendan fraser‘s bare ass-cheeks dutifully pumping away five minutes into the pilot that i realized doom patrol might be divisive. the third original series after titans and young justice: outsiders for the still-young dc universe streaming service, doom patrol is a weird trip down the rabbit hole, a surreal, darkly comic ode to misfits and outcasts that occasionally comes off like it’s trying too hard to be strange—including a doors needle drop so obvious i audibly groaned—but in an endearing way. for all its oddities and awkwardness, doom patrol is a show about a fucked up family finding each other, and it works really well because all these characters are so unique, each wonderfully brought to life by the cast and creative choices. “critics, what do they know? they’re gonna hate this show,” alan tudyk says in the first episode as doom patrol‘s main villain/self-aware narrator mr. nobody. for the first time in the history of talking about comic books on the internet, nobody is wrong. - ***3/5***

[superbromovies.com](https://superbromovies.com/2019/02/11/doom-patrol-pilot-review-dc-universes-next-big-hit-has-arrived/)

>we had the opportunity to view the pilot early but no worries, we won’t be delving into any spoilers. before i get into details, i must start with that fact that intro sequence for the show is quite fantastic and gave me westworld vibes. it’s miles better than the titans’ intro, that’s for sure. the question is, does the show itself learn from the mistakes of first dc universe show and make something that stands on its own? i certainly think it does. it isn’t perfect by any means, but a great start for an exciting and different superhero show that will become a hit for the dc universe.

>the best way to describe the pilot without giving spoilers away is that it’s like the first half of a movie. clocking in at nearly an hour, we get an origin for each of the members of the doom patrol while also setting up the main storyline for the season. that includes the villain mr. nobody, but more on that later. everyone gets their time to shine and each actor gives their all to the show. rita farr and crazy jane are among my favorites, with negative man not falling to far behind. timothy dalton is a very welcome replacement for chief. however, there’s one character that completely surprised me. 

>the real standout is brendan fraser’s robotman, who delivers a brilliant performance that is both nuanced and revealing. flashbacks allow fraser to be on camera and he truly shines, but he still gives just as great of a performance as robotman. he had the most development and became the heart of the show very quickly. just in the pilot alone, there are enough twists and turns in his story to leave you shellshocked.

>the villain of the show is mr. nobody, played by alan tudyk, and he’s a force to be reckoned with. he gets his own introduction in the pilot as well, but his main function will surprise people. you see, he narrates some of the show and intentionally breaks the fourth wall. his character is so powerful that he is aware that the events are taking place in a show. it allows for out-of-the-box comedy that may or may not hit all the time, but for the most part, i found myself thoroughly enjoying it.

>the pacing of the show is surprisingly smooth even with the hour runtime. this is probably due to the number of characters the show focuses on right off the bat. it is also evident dc put a lot into this show, the production value is great and the visual effects are very serviceable. there was a lot of love poured into this and i can’t wait to see what else is in store for our superhero team.

>doom patrol has a fantastic start that shows a lot of promise for the rest of the season. from the characters to the story, there is more than enough to grip the audience and take them for a ride. the performances from the entire cast are exquisite, with brendan fraser’s robotman being a revelation. it isn’t perfect, of course, but this is by far one of the best things dc universe has put out (yes, including young justice outsiders). - ***9/10***

[cbr.com](https://www.cbr.com/doom-patrol-tv-review/) 

>with doom patrol, it's almost as if dc universe depicted the (initially, at least) dismissive response to titans' dark and serious tone, and set out to concoct an antidote. the third original series from the fledgling streaming service is wonderfully bizarre and self-aware, exactly what you'd hope for comic book characters once billed as ""the world's strangest heroes.""

>doom patrol's first episode isn't perfect, of course, something perhaps best illustrated by the producers' inability to resist using the doors' ""people are strange."" but it's charmingly offbeat, alternately funny and heartbreaking, and strangely irresistible.

[wegotthiscovered.com](https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/doom-patrol-season-1-review/)

>one thing i bet you’re dying to ask is if doom patrol is better than titans. at this point in time, i’m not sure if i can fully answer that because, while i dug titans from the get-go and thought it improved as it went along, doom patrol boasts the better premiere. taking that into consideration, it could very well eclipse its predecessor given time, of course.

>still, i could see this drawing mixed reactions because some critics and viewers may want something a little “safer.” but in a world flooded with comic book-based movies and tv shows, don’t you want there to be productions unafraid to remove the kid gloves and show us something different? the narration even goes as far to say critics will hate doom patrol, but i, for one, love it. - ***5/5***

[decider.com](https://decider.com/2019/02/11/doom-patrol-review-dc-universe/)

>look, the show isn’t perfect. the writing is sometimes a mess to the point where it feels like something must have been edited out. one character is said to wander in and out of the house as she pleases, and another character — who has been a resident for decades — has never met her before. another time everyone decides to leave forever, only to return the next scene. but the mess, frankly, is part of the doom patrol aesthetic. it’s supposed to be messy, and weird, and not all fit together in the right ways. it’s supposed to make you question structure, the way a superhero show — and perhaps even a tv show — should be. that it’s not always successful is fine, because where it does win puts it on par with any other drama on tv. it’s part and parcel with other genre-bending shows like syfy’s deadly class, or amc’s preacher, fellow comic book based series that don’t fall easily into any particular classification.

>there’s nothing inherently wrong with going into the pilot of a new series without a clear idea of what your show is going to be. if you don’t believe that to be true, then i have a mystery show about strangers on an island i’d like to show you. but, when said show decides it’s better than the people that will judge it and calls reference to said people in voice-over dialogue, one can’t help but feel miffed by a lack of desire on the series’ part to own what it is and what it could become. 

>“the critics are gonna hate this show.” a line spoken by one of the main characters in expository voice-over that one could argue is an attempt to absolve the series of any shortcomings. to put a twist on a classic kevin smith self-deprecation joke, “well, they know.” but to do such a thing is to undermine any hope of being the breakout weirdo show doom patrol desires to be.

>you can’t just go around claiming your show is going to be terrible so that if someone finds it as such their argument is deflated. rather, any show such as doom patrol - a show consisting of some truly outlandish imagery and personalities and timelines - should be working to own itself and its conceits. there is no reason doom patrol has to portray its existence for a bad joke. there is no reason it can’t lost itself. no reason it couldn’t have gone into the pilot saying: “yes, this a weird spin-off to those characters that were in that other show a couple months back, but, you know what, we’re gonna freaking try to make this work because come on, how could we not?” had it done that, then one could say it bucked every pre-existing notion imaginable to deliver on something truly unique. 

>the product, as it is, chooses to be bland despite delivering on moments of true emotional resonance - particularly with storylines related to robotman. there was a unique and fascinating show to be made out of doom patrol. a show that would have looked at the weirdness of legends of tomorrow and said: “hold my beer.” instead… we got what we currently have. - ***negative***

[comicsbeat.com](https://www.comicsbeat.com/review-doom-patrol-gets-off-to-an-intriguing-if-constrained-start/)

>these character origins are pretty comic accurate, thankfully. there’s no modernization. larry is a 1960’s test pilot, rita is a 1950’s b-movie actress, and they get their powers in the exact way you’d expect if you’re a fan of the property. the character designs are basically in line with their presentation in the most recent doom patrol series, even down to cliff’s t-shirt with little scribbled messages, and larry’s jacket. from that perspective it’s a show built for the fan in mind.

>it’s also hard not to appreciate its attempt at ambition, beyond just the scope of their individual lived-in experiences. the episode is bracketed by the story of eric morden (alan tudyk), who thanks to an experiment in paraguay, becomes the two-dimensional (literally) villain mr. nobody. this antagonist provides not only a bit of melodramatic voice over work (which could have used a few more writing passes perhaps), but appears by episode’s end – even breaking the fourth wall in a pretty cute wink and nod to the show’s reference material. it’s here where you get a sense of just how off-kilter jeremy carver and team are hoping to go, and it gives me hope that this might just be a launching pad for further insanity. 

>doom patrol gets off to a more exciting start than titans, and i’m curious where it goes next. i just warn viewers expecting flex mentallo they might want to hold off on those wishes for next season.

>also, here is a gassy donkey that farts out messages. so that’s something!

>dc universe’s doom patrol isn’t a show that hates itself—it hates the very concept of idyllic superheroes. a hero’s seeming perfection, good looks, and general amiability are all just distractions, doom patrol posits, from what really matters: the fact that being exceptional and extraordinary means that the world is never really going to love or understand you.

>each of doom patrol’s heroes has origins deeply rooted in tragedy. unlike the titans, for example, their meta-humanity isn’t something that any of them see as something that’s made their lives objectively better. for all of them, being exceptional means having to live on the edges of society, where the things that make them strong and unique can’t be seen by the outside world.

>objectively speaking, they’re all supremely fucked in terms of living normal lives, but each of doom patrol’s heroes knows that courageous vigilantism is part of their futures.
doom patrol’s very much a show about a ragtag group of social outcasts saving the world, the series dedicates a substantial amount of time conveying to us just how difficult the team’s powers make it for them to function in the most basic sense. while they become very concerned with the town-disappearing threat of mr. nobody (alan tudyk), their own oddities are really the thing they’re all trying to get a handle on.
that being said, the series also homes in on what it is about each member of the group’s idiosyncrasies that make them work as a family as opposed to a team. robotman’s longing for his family contrasts with rita’s desire to stay cooped up in her room watching her old films, and jane meets larry’s resolute expressiveness with a variety of emotions that all boil down to one form of disdain or another. wildly different as they are from one another, the oppositional personalities of the chief’s charges have a way of bringing out their peers’ humanity, and that’s what pulls them together as heroes, though none of them really see themselves that way.


>because the dc universe streaming service is populated with teams of burgeoning heroes who are all so sure of themselves, doom patrol stands out. nobody on the doom patrol verbalizes how much they don’t want to be superheroes, but it’s written all over each of their faces. they’re a group of people who’ve been supremely put upon by fate, and rather than taking it all in good stride like proper heroes, they’re upset. they’re angry, broken, and unsure of just who or what it is exactly they’re meant to be—and it makes them all riveting to watch.

>doom patrol is gritty, fun and a little gory. it’s so weird and unlike any other hero show i’ve ever seen. the performances on the series are pretty good causing you to believe in this fantastical plot and fall in love with this series about a bunch of weirdos. this is a much-watch for dc fans.  - ***8/10***

[withanaccent.com](http://www.withanaccent.com/2019/02/11/review-doom-patrol-is-what-dreams-are-made-of/)

>and at first, the members of the doom patrol do seem like a bunch of zeroes, as we’re thrust into the middle of cliff steele’s (brendan fraser, who plays both both lewdness and loss with equal fervor) affair with the nanny while his wife works out and his child cries in the next room. their marriage quickly came to a fiery end, only for what was left of cliff to end up at dr. caulder’s home ten years later inside of a metal encasing that comic book readers know as robotman. caulder – who goes by chief – may be the most disconcerting thing about the pilot episode, if only because he was played by bruno bichir is his first appearance and came off much colder and more frightening that he does now. it’s not a bad change, though, as i much prefer the kindly if misguided version dalton embodies to the steely one that filled gar with fear. speaking of gar, that’s the second point of contention: it’s unclear when in the timeline he lived with the group, seeing as they don’t mention him once despite reaching present day by the end of the premiere.

>those are really the only two issues in the entire beautifully constructed hour, because the rest of doom patrol is devoted to introducing most of its protagonists and exploring their tragic tales. rita farr (april bowlby, equal parts flighty and full of heart) watches her films on a loop and remembers the days before she was a pile of goo known as elastigirl, while larry trainor (matt bomer, in an understated performance that makes use entirely of his rich and emotive voice) makes light of his losses and the life he was hiding back in the 60s. the disconnect between what these characters say about themselves, what they learn from third parties, and what is revealed to the audience by mr. nobody’s omniscient narration comprises half of the show’s charm. the rest comes from stunning cinematographic sequences that underline just how much effort dc has put into this show.
[bostonherald.com](https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/02/10/doom/)

>i was 5 years old when i discovered the doom patrol in the waiting area at tony’s barber shop on broadway in somerville. in the pages of that worn dc comic book, there was elasti-woman, a b-movie starlet whose exposure to strange gases gave her the power to grow and shrink to outrageous proportions; negative man, an ace pilot whose exposure to cosmic radiation cursed him with an energy being who bursts from his body; robotman, a race car driver so badly injured in a crash that his brain was transplanted into a metal body; and their leader, the wheelchair-bound genius niles caulder, known as the chief. these were damaged souls, feared and hated by a world that didn’t deserve them.

>seen in an episode of the dc universe’s “titans” and now spinning off into their own series, this adaptation from executive producers geoff johns and greg berlanti (behind all the cw superhero shows) is just as wonderful and weird as the comic. like many tv series, most notably “grey’s anatomy,” it features a voiceover …

>… this one, from the villain.

>“more tv superheroes — just what the world needs! be honest: have you hung yourself yet?” mr. nobody (alan tudyk, “firefly”) jeers. he’s a third-rate flunky who was transformed by a nazi scientist into a dangerous extra-dimensional entity. and he bears a grudge against niles (timothy dalton, “penny dreadful”). niles has spent decades investigating the bizarre anomalies around the globe and caring for those with special abilities. the pilot explores the backstories for cliff (brendan fraser, “condor”), larry (matt bomer, “white collar”) and rita (april bowlby, “two and a half men”) with some twists that might surprise fans. “all i wanted to give you was a gentle place to land. a second chance,” niles explains.

>his adaptation borrows notably from comics writer grant morrison’s acclaimed, surreal 1990s run and so includes crazy jane (diane guerrero, “orange is the new black”), a woman with 64 personalities, each with their own powers. jane convinces them one afternoon to venture into the nearby town for the first time in decades. what could go wrong?

>everything.

>in the second episode, cyborg (joivan wade) joins the team. why is cyborg here? i have no idea. he’s dc’s most prominent hero of color (sorry, black lightning), but “doom patrol” has a diverse roster to draft from. with cyborg, the team reluctantly explores a mystery that starts with a farting donkey who is also a door to another realm.

>i told you this was weird.

>amid the insanity, bowlby captures rita’s haughty attitude — “i am a golden globe nominee,” she protests during one tense moment — and the pathos that lies beneath. fraser is the perfect embodiment of joe everyman turned into a mechanical marvel. dalton delivers a benevolent, if controlling leader. dc universe only made two episodes available for review, rough cuts, and the visuals might be tweaked before airing. negative man is not nearly as impressive as he should be. “critics! what do they know? they’re going to hate this show,” nobody sneers.

>he doesn’t know as much as he thinks he does.

>just like that kid racing through that comic book all those years ago, i want to see more. - ***b***

ap08or,okay so i have been trying to find out who the s4 villain is and...,1.0,12.0,67.0,brakebills,"i have looked through multiple wikipedia pages, it's sources and **every other website i could find** related to the olympians and mythological creatures. 

the monster said that bacchus and he **share the same parents**, so **taking that literally** i looked through **all children that persephone had** and **none** of them are similar to the monster.

then i thought, maybe the monster meant ""same parents"" as in **olympians**, so i **looked through every child the olympians have created**, be it god or monster and **none of them fit** the monster.

then i looked through **every being in greek mythology that is related to nympholepsy** (the belief of the ancient greeks that individuals could be possessed by the nymphs) and **possession**, **nothing**.

the writers most likely **did their own thing** here and us theorizing for now is useless (in terms of finding out who the monster really is). if i had to make a list of who are the closest candidates to the monster, i'd answer with this:

* **kronos** (there's the whole ""we share the same parents"" thing though that debunks this)

* **prometheus** (same as the last one except this one is way more unlikely yet this one is the most believed one)

* a special kind of **nymph** (unlikely)

* a special kind of **eidolon** (unlikely)

* a **new son/daughter of persephone** that the show will make up.

* just a **weird monster being** who got trapped in the prison and was coincidentally the strongest (yeah...)

---

i have also been looking into who he's been hunting so far and **there has to be a connection** between the **gods** he's already been hunting:

* **bacchus**

* **enyalius**

with possibly **persephone** being next because in some versions of the myth she's bacchus' mother and she's also basically the main and most powerful goddess in the show and books. i tried looking for a connection between bacchus and enyalius, and all i found was this piece of text from ""**nimrod**: a discourse on certain passages of history and fable, volume 3"":

>*the lacedaemonians sacrificed a dog to enyalius in the phoebeium, which was close to the spoit called the therapna of helen, and we know that this deity of the spartans was the god* ***liber***, *and was denominated* ***bacchus enyalius***.

and it seems to fit what i found on the wiki page about the god **liber**:

>*in ancient roman religion and mythology, liber /ˈlaɪbər/ (latin: līber [ˈliːbɛr], ""the free one""), also known as liber pater (""the free father""), was a god of viticulture and wine, fertility and freedom. he was a patron deity of rome's plebeians and was part of their aventine triad. his festival of liberalia (march 17) became associated with free speech and the rights attached to coming of age. his cult and functions were increasingly associated with* ***romanised forms of the greek dionysus/bacchus, whose mythology he came to share.***

**liber** is the son of **ceres**, the roman equivalent of the greek goddess **demeter**. demeter is the mother of **dionysus**, ya know, **bacchus**. the guy who the monster told that they share the same parents. demeter is also the mother of your favorite main goddess, **olu/persephone**. we know that the show plays fast and loose with greek and roman versions, they're the same and some gods go by the greek name (hades, persephone etc.) and some go by the roman name (bacchus).

this is all very interesting and this all fits more and more, the more i look into it but i'm not actually sure if this means anything. **what do you think?**

well, i started with the first runaways run from 2003. i am on issue 11 and i've noticed some differences.

####chase stein

first of all, chase is almost completely different. sure he still has that comical sillyness but that's about it. in the show, he's actually a genius. he's extremely caring and smart but he still has some of that dumb sport stereotype background in him. in the comics, he's basically that one guy from s2 that stole the fistigons but had no idea what they were. in the comics, chase didn't create the fistigons, so far he hasn't done anything like the show version and i'm happy because the show version is so, so so so much better.

[fistigon stealer guy form the show](https://i.imgur.com/26ocaai.png)

####gert yorkes

can't talk about chase without talking about gert before or after it heh. gert in the comics and show are extremely similar. they look and act (mostly) the same. the one thing i noticed is that comics gert is less uh, gert. sure she still makes snarky comments about certain characters being together and stuff like that, but she doesn't go as far as the show gert. the closest comics gert has come to show gert is when she made a comment about sexual tension between two characters, that's it. everything else is the same though, so far. her parents are different but i'm going to talk about it in their section.

####molly hayes

molly is also mostly the same. she looks a bit different but she still has her comical childish nature. in the comics she is a lot more childish and innocently ignorant though. i think that's because she's older in the show.

####karolina dean

karolina is mostly the same though. to be honest, i don't know how to describe karolina. i guess she's just too peaceful for her own good? but she grew out of that almost instantly. i feel like right now (as in where i am in the comics and at the end of s2 of the show), she's mostly a neutral character. her character is kind of... empty? she isn't exceptionally smart, she isn't comic relief. she doesn't make snarky/sarcastic/annoying comments and stuff. she's just... there? the comics had a bit of ""muh i'm an alien i hate myself"" but it was so artificially and badly added it wasn't really fun. right now she hates nico i guess but that's really all her character is useful for right now, drama.

her powers and stuff are still the same, but in the comics, she hasn't learned to control it so far.

####alex wilder

alex is mostly the same. in the show he has a lot more bloodlust, though. i hope his comic book version grows into the show version.

i am also pretty sure that alex is the mole... alex or karolina... the show went with chase kind of but i don't expect the show to have chosen the same character at the comics because that ruins basically any attempt of suspense or excitement because you already know what's going to happen. besides, chase is too dumb for any of this.

####nico minoru

i have saved nico for last because i like her character the most. i can see why the show didn't go with the cutting herself to get the staff thing. i feel like the comic and show versions are extremely alike but they both went into different directions for her character, and i would like both versions to do be more like each other. like kind of merge them.

show nico is a lot more bitchy (and i love it) and depressing, while the comics version is a lot nicer. though her comics version is also way more bloodthirsty. she knows she has great power and she wants to use it. i remember hearing her mother talk about how even fucking **dormammu** is scared (or at least wary) of the wand. i want the bitchy sarcastic nico mixed with the bloodthirsty nico. we saw a bit of that in the s2 fight against jonah.

i will talk about the parents later because i don't have much time left but i just wanted to talk a bit about the comics because it has some major and minor differences compared to the comics.

(i've seen like ""i need to eat"" go-fund-me's posted a lot) i'm still pretty poor myself, paycheck to paycheck, but what they are asking for i can do - and like i said i've been there. i've needed help. luckily i had people to help me and i suspect that might not be the case with ronny.


so i'm happy to give. but then they come back again for more money every couple of months now. never a lot, and people gotta look out for each other. but it keeps coming, it's gotten to the point that i feel like they know i'll give it and their like getting too comfortable with it, like taking it for granted. 

even though i am poor, its not the money that bothers me, its the mindset. i worked hard to fix my shit and get my life on track from the time that it was a disaster. i want to support ronny towards ronny being able to support themself, i feel invested in that. but i suspect that ronny is just stringing out desperate decisions and favors and not moving forward. so i say to ronny i'm willing to give you this money if i know its going towards something that will help you help yourself, getting a real room to rent instead of couch surfing, getting formal clothes to interview in, job training whatever. ronny doesn't really want to tell me about their situation, and is kind of insulted when i hinge the money on knowing about their plan for self-improvement. then race/gender gets brought into it, like these things dictated their poverty. i mean fine, social stigma happens outside of your control, prejudice exists, i'll grant you that even when poor i had a level of advantage over ronny. i'm not saying its easy. but you still have to take responsibility despite those things and start working to dig yourself out. you have to focus on what you can control even if the system is turned against you. the alternative is just to be crushed or live on charity and pity. if ronny is working to fix their life i'm thrilled to help them get there. but they say i just don't understand, privileged, nosy, etc. so i said i don't really think i can keep giving you money. 

but i kinda feel like an asshole because like i said the money was not a lot, and i know sometimes when your life is a shit-pile you don't really want to talk about it or face the mountain of work it would take to turn it around. i wanted to encourage them to start that process but i think i just became another person abandoning them.

tldr: i start giving money to a poor, depressed person on a semi-regular basis, but cut it off when the person refuses to talk to me about how they are planning to improve their situation.",12586.0,6907.0,0.76,2019-01-23 18:51:00,Howdidnoonetakethis,0.0,0.0,5.0,3453.0,655.0

1. ult cd. this has been talked about a lot. it used to be, in the good old days, using ult to clear a wave wasn't a huge deal, especially at rank 2 or 3, but now it really is a consideration.

2. mana costs. as have been said elsewhere her mana costs seem high, and people are having a rough time juggling the mana. especially if you are against a champ that shoves you in all day (malz, morg, ekko, yadda yadda) where you have to use spells to farm under tower it can be really hard to last hit. this is made even harder because the first major mana item you want to buy costs 1100 gold now, not 900. 

3. backloaded damage. they backloaded a lot of damage on q and e, which in a fight is okay. it's a cool compromise between revert and rework lb. but when it comes to farming, sometimes you have to use chain, but because it's initial damage is hardly even an auto attack worth of damage a lot of times it's way less useful. 

so when you get a kill its often hard to shove quickly, its also a factor in making it harder to come back when your behind because you have to use spells to farm under tower so you don't have them for a fight, and it can make a lot of situations very frustrating. now, sure you can be all korean about it and just say ""don't miss cs"" but i think its a big part of why she feels weaker right now.

i was even looking forward to seeing her again. i bought traditional dresses from my home country for her because they are not easy to find in europe. we have been in touch in getting to know her favorite clothing color and exchanging pictures of the places each of us were visiting over this period.

but now i'm afraid of meeting her again. i've been hurt many times by not having my feelings reciprocated. i'm worried that i will fall for this girl very badly and end up being burnt. 

i guess i shouldn't meet her ever again. do you agree with me?

you are probably wondering why i'm asking this here. well, one part of me is really really tempted to meet her again and is kinda bleeding deep inside because my other side is so reluctant to meet her. i just want to convince myself to not meet her by getting other opinions. thanks.",1882.0,1187.0,0.83,2019-01-27 18:29:49,nah_it_wont_happen,0.0,0.0,18.0,1271.0,241.0

i have checked the stats of all the recently debuted australian batsmen. almost all of them have an average less 40, even in domestic cricket. back in the day, even the likes of mark elliott, greg blewett, who had brief international career, possessed first class averages of equal to or more than 45. this comparison just shows how poor australian batsmen have become.

i'd understand it if bangladesh struggles when one of the likes of tamim/shakib is out, because we (i'm a bangladeshi) are the epitome of mediocrity, but as a general cricket fan, i find it really disappointing to see australian batsmen struggling so badly.

9phri2,anyone else who love sex but don't like people?,32.0,9.0,47.0,sex,"i lost my virginity pretty late(27) in my life because i used to be really religious. i have always been kinda asocial as well, very rarely going out and meeting people. however, somehow, at 27, a girl asked me out and she was my first. i wasn't really attracted to her(great curvy body but didn't find her cute), but i was lonely and couldn't resist her offer of sex.

since then, i ended up having sex with many more women, mostly with older women (i'm a pretty short guy, so young and hot women have better options than i am), despite my lack of social life. i have also had sex with many hookers since then (it's legal and protected where i live). the older women i have had sex with, i was never attracted to any of them. the hookers i have slept with were some really hot chicks. 

so, from the above facts, you can see that i have had sex with plenty of women who i never had any mental connection at all, it's all because i just love sex. however, it's not about me having an orgasm as with more than 50% i never had one. i just like the intimacy, that's all.

ultimately, i don't like to spend time with people much. i like spending time alone. i even live alone thousands of miles from from my family in a different continent and culture. while i talk to my mom frequently (cos she demands it) i only visit them every couple of years. anywhere i travel, i do it alone (like recently went to venice, florence, bologna). i have very few friends anyway. the only reason i tend to interact with people is to get some sex, which is why i have more female friends than male ones.

are anyone here like that who don't like spending time with people but really enjoy sex? how do you deal with it?",1882.0,1187.0,0.87,2018-10-19 11:04:18,nah_it_wont_happen,0.0,0.0,9.0,1698.0,325.0

i absolutely flabbergasted and feel a victim of injustice. i will never use airbnb anymore. i had 260 euros as security deposit for this stay, i think airbnb can definitely take that money. however, i want to block all means of airbnb taking the rest of the money. i have already deleted my credit card info in that account but cannot delete the paypal info. meanwhile, they have also deactivated my account because they **attempted to charge the payment method on file for the security deposit but received an error**.

there was a microwave which i had used for heating up food from time to time. once, while doing so, i have opened the door without the timer finishing. i have done this many times before with many microwave ovens but never had any problems with those. afaik, the microwave is supposed to switch off once the door is open. it's not user friendly at all for the machine to break if ones open the door when running, so manufactures make it as such that opening the door doesn't cause an issue. however, on this occassion it gave a problem. nonetheless, a friend of the airbnb owner was nearby and he did something which seemed to have sorted the problem.

however, the day i was leaving, i used the microwave once more in the morning. after i have left, apparently, the microwave started to give problems again. and today i received the following message in airbnb with nearly 700 chf charged.

**the microwave was damaged due to inproper handling according the technician from bauknecht. on tuesday it was fine. one hour after you left it was broken. the technician suggested it was due to i.e. foil or something else inside the microwave, which rebounded and in addition the microwave was practically new.**

to which i replied:

***i'm very well aware that using a foil paper can destroy the microwave. hence, i never used it in your microwave. the only mistake i've done with your microwave is opening the door when running, which happened on the day you're with your friend and he sorted it out.***

***on the day, when i left, i only used the microwave in the morning, that was 3/4 hours before i've left. then i only used your plate.***

***as i didn't cause the damage, i declined your request.***

i have also added further message which is the following:

***i have looked at the manual for baunecht in this link: https://www.manualslib.com/manual/587997/bauknecht-oven.html?page=2#manual***

***there is a section for ""during use"". where it describes the following:***

*** *do not place heavy objects on the door as they could damage it.***

*** *do not cling to the door or hang anything from the handle.***

*** *do not cover the inside of the oven with aluminium foil.***

*** *never pour water into the inside of a hot oven; this could damage the enamel coating.***

*** *never drag pots or pans across the bottom of the oven as this could damage the enamel coating.***

*** *make sure that the electrical cables of other appliances do not touch hot parts of the oven or become trapped in the door.***

*** *never expose the oven to atmospheric agents.***

***according to this, i never caused any mishandling because opening the door when microwave is running is not an error. on top of that, the technician from baunecht told only using materials inside the oven must have cause the damage, which i never did. hence, i'm totally not liable for damaging your microwave, regardless of it being new or old.***

beer tastes the worst, extremely bitter, absolutely not pleasant at all.

champagne tasted okay, but feels like a medicine. wine tasted similar too.

vodka/gin just gives a very strong, dizzying sensation, but nothing pleasant.

in fact, drinking alcholol doesn't me make relaxed at all, only sleepier (i'm always sleepy anyway). moreover, i find it difficult to kiss any girl if she has drunk alcohol, because the alcohol makes her mouth smell awful.

**envision yourself where you want to be.**

this one may seem like the classic thing that a success coach will tell you, but it helped me greatly. whenever i would be studying or doing homework for a class and noticing myself get distracted or pulled away, i would close my eyes, and imagine where i wanted to be next year. i would ask myself what was more important, my dream school and college experience, or wasting my time playing league of legends. every time you feel yourself not wanting to do your school work, just ask yourself if whatever is distracting you now is worth what it may cost you a year from now. 


**minimize distractions and emphasize goals.**

i would not have gotten to go to college where i do today if i hadn't found a way to keep myself on track. what helped me the most was to know and avoid my biggest distractions. in my case, it was my desktop. i couldn't do my homework on a computer that was able to run video games, period. so i took my gaming computer completely apart, put it in a box, and hid it in the basement, not to be opened until school was over. you know what your kryptonite is, find a way to manage or completely rid yourself of it.

another thing that helped me was to have constant reminders around me to keep me on track. my dream school (at the time) was usc, so i hung a massive trojans banner on my wall. i had 4 usc shirts. my laptop wallpaper was usc. my phone wallpaper was usc. no matter where i looked i had another sign telling me to work harder. do the same thing for yourself, go turn yourself into the biggest diehard fan in the world. even if you don't get into your number one, working hard trying might make the difference for your second.


**remind yourself how far you have come.**

think back on how hard you have worked throughout the rest of your high school career. remind yourself how many times you were stressed out of your mind studying for a test. think about the times you pulled an all nighter to write a 5 page essay due the next morning. remember the time you did the entire group project yourself because your neanderthal group members didn't hold their weight. remind yourself of every time you worked your ass off to get where you stand today. did you work that hard to stop just before the finish line? no. you owe it to your past self to make your goals then a reality tomorrow. 

imagine college as a gift to yourself. whether you end up going to your reach school or your safety school, you worked hard to get there, and that should mean something to you. you guys have less than 6 months to go, don't let up now.

what did that do to my grades?
i stopped caring. all i had to do is pass my core classes, i could fail out of my extra curricular courses (ap psych) and still be okay and on track with bottom of the line c's.... until i got an email from cal poly. i had been picked off of the wait list, and had been offered a conditional acceptance, conditional on me maintaining my gpa for senior year at the same level it had been the previous years. i now am absolutely losing my shit, i have 3 weeks to graduate and i have to do almost an entire semesters worth of work in all my core classes, just to get a b and maintain my old gpa.

there has been a lot of public discourse about the standards of education in america's public school recently. the entire discussion is flawed, however, because no one really states the reality of public education: it has become a nanny for parents who cannot or choose not to take care of their children. this cmv is not to disparage public education - in fact i am a school board member and my wife is a public school teacher - obviously we support public education - but the discussion is judged on the outcomes that the school itself cannot control.

to suggest our schools are failing is a lie.  perhaps they are failing because children come to school hungry and cannot learn, or cold and do not have coats, or come with the mental trauma of domestic abuse.  those are all real issues but should not be taken into consideration when judging a school ""good"" or ""bad.""  the judgement should only come from students who meet a baseline where the actual academic curriculum can be absorbed. how is it fair to judge a school as failing if a good portion of the children ""fail"" because of things outside the school's control?

because public school have to cater to the broken and the hungry it takes away resources and time that could be devoted to academic curriculum.  private schools, for the most part, have much fewer of these problems to deal with, so their curriculum is superior. it would be a mistake against my children to not send them to the best school for the academic growth.

an6ezd,cmv:we should subsidize fruits and vegetables and not corn and soybeans,38.0,25.0,71.0,changemyview,"currently the us subsidizes corn and soybean production and not fruits and vegetables. (there may be instances of these subsidies, but they are not at all widespread as corn and soybeans).

americans diets have gotten significantly worse since the government started subsidizing corn and high fructose corn syrup was put in almost everything and government support makes production cheap.  this support also makes people more apt to grow corn and soybeans because they know they'll have a price floor and won't lose everything in a bad year. in essence, the government is encouraging people to grow unhealthy food at the expense of healthy food.

if we stopped subsidizing corn and put those dollars towards fruits and vegetables we would have more healthy food options more readily available, greater diversity of farming in states where corn and/or soybeans dominate the landscape, and it would encourage people to grow food that is better for us.

this would be a win/win in my book and something we should do immediately.  the only people opposed to such a move would be corn farmers who get government money and wouldn't want to see that money disappear.

al0uup,yesterday i realized something...,2046.0,178.0,33.0,Parenting,"we have a few young children an also just started fostering a child.  for years i wondered why children don't ""just behave""?  it must be bad role models or bad genes, or something inside the mind of the child. but i was wrong and i'm sorry it took me years to realize it.

a few days back my wife was yelling at my 4 year old for being naughty. the kind of naughty where he knows what he's doing and every statement results in a whine or throwing toys. we were getting nowhere so i tried something new. i went over and asked him what toy he wanted me to play with. he stopped whining and went downstairs with me and we played in the toy room for an hour.  not a whine, no throwing things, or anything naughty. just a boy and his dad playing. the next day something similar happened, and i calmly asked him to help me tell a story about a naughty boy at a made-up daycare. his eyes lit up as he told me about all of his real daycare friends, navigating their made-up world and given secret code names so i would't know who was who.

we were warned the foster child might have some anger issues.  and he does.  but what mitigated that anger almost immediately was someone just talking to him and offering to play - no strings attached. my guess is he never had power in his life and me, giving my time and attention, is what made him feel better.

this may be very basic for all of you but it wasn't for me.  kids just want to be listened to, to be played with, and their acting out is a result of not knowing how to ask for extra attention.  

instead of yelling, calmly go grab a toy and start playing with it yourself.  instead of storming out of the room start asking questions about their world until they stop whining and start answering.  it changed my entire outlook on parenting and i'm sorry for my children that it took so long.

for example, my wife and i make about $125,000 per year and have two children. if i lost my job we'd be down to about $60,000 (which is about twice my state's income limit for food stamps) which would completely alter our financial priorities. after taxes, insurance, and daycare we'd be almost down to zero income. 

i don't think it would encourage people so spend money foolishly.  in fact, i believe the current asset limits force people to spend money foolishly. we save about 20% of our net income, pay into a children's college fund account, and have a house and cars we can afford. people who are responsible and lose a job should not be punished for saving.

ac6g52,cmv:property taxes should be assessed based on the size of your lot and not the value of the building on the lot.,13.0,69.0,113.0,changemyview,"currently property assessment in the us is based on the value of your property and the building that sites on the property. this is problematic for several reasons.

1. assessors must make judgement about your building value every year without knowing the technical features of the building (so they are essentially guessing).
2. it encourages larger developments on the outskirts of town where land is cheaper.  this encourages urban sprawl and the social and environmental problems it creates.
3. it doesn't force the highest-and-best-use of a property.  

we should tax properties based on the lot size alone. here's why:

1. it would encourage better development.  there is no reason a person in the city should pay more taxes than a person in the suburbs with 3x the land.  our land is used poorly and suburbs are hard to redevelop.
2. it would encourage people to only buy the land they need.  they could still buy as much as they wanted, they would just know it would cost them more to do so.
3. creating a fair transparent metric means there is no hard math to understand, no guessing at assessment values, and most importantly, no ""mill rates"" or other formulas needed which exist to add complexity.

if we taxed based on land size along it would encourage better development which would encourage people to make better choices in where the decide to live, it would encourage builders to not waste land, and it would encourage cities to remove overly-large single family zoning regulations as much of the population wouldn't want to pay the associated taxes.

**edit** based on feedback, i have decided a growth boundary will be necessary around cities and everything in the boundary would be taxed the same.  agricultural land outside the boundary could not be developed until the area inside was filled out, at which time the boundary would expand.

for those of you in monogamous marriages, how do you express/explore your bisexuality? what sort of things do you do, or places you go to ""be yourself"" and faithful at the same time?

my wife is struggling with my bisexuality, not that i am trying to come on to dudes or cheat on her, she is just afraid, but i want to be authentically me. when i drop the ""straight guy"" act and actually be myself i am a tad more...effeminate and loose (not in a fake way at all). my therapist calls it the real me and she sees it happen more and more during our sessions. i want to share this freedom and break through with my wife, but i don't know when the right time is. we are also struggling with infertility (we have one child, but several miscarriages and now 12 months of infertility) so i think i should wait until a more emotionally stable time. what do you all think?

also, as you can see from my comment history, i do enjoy r/bigonewild, r/mengonewild, and r/ondww... it is another thing i need to be honest about with my wife. it is reassuring to me that i am totally sexually attracted to men, but porn of any kind is seen by my wife as evil and destructive (she was raised super conservative, and this is one of the last ""hangers on"" from that worldview). i think i need to stop commenting on and viewing all those cocks (and their owners) i dream of kissing, sucking, and fucking. it makes being in a straight marriage more difficult. am i alone here? i don't post nudes to any subreddit, so that is a line i haven't crossed (i also don't know if i would be well received.

long time lurker, first time poster and i need some solid advice/support.

so the long and the short of it is: i consider myself to be a bisexual man (i am 35). i have never been physically intimate with another man, but i know it would rock, the same way i knew having sex with women would rock when i was a teenage virgin. 

however, it has taken me a long time to come to terms with who i am (i'm still working through it). two months ago i came out to my wife. not just a ""that dude's cute, ha, ha,"" way, but ""i am bisexual."" i assured her this didn't mean i was wanting to leave her, destroy our marriage, or abandon our son (all things she feared). this was all around a time when i decided to start getting therapy and change my depression medication to a more effective one. i told her i needed to be honest with who i am and that i needed to explore what that means with a therapist.

now i feel more myself and feel free to think the sexy thoughts i used to punish myself over. however, i feel a strong sense of imposter syndrome... am i really only ever going to be labeled bi-curious by members of the lgbtq community who don't know me? do i need to have an intimate fuck with another guy in order to ""prove"" myself? is it wrong of me to identify as bisexual when i haven't done the deed irl (there have been some annonymous cam sessions in my past with other men)?

also, how do you negotiate being matried and bi with your husband/wife? especially if you are in my situation where my wife is 100% against me having another loving relationship.

i do love my wife and want to honor the monogamy of our marriage. does that mean i have no right to be bisexual? she is ok with me reaching out to the bi community and even saying sexy things to annonymous men on reddit, but no sexting...

anyhoo, any advice would be very welcome!

i recently lost around 30kg on keto(120kg down to 90kg). i kept my focus on loosing the weight before i build muscle. i have now reached the point where i feel comfortable enough to start building muscle and strength. 

any pointers as to how i can convey my goals to the trainer? i have three sessions with him this week. basically i would like to keep my current keto lifestyle, although i don't have any issues with a few carbs here and there, if it will assist with strength etc. 

how do i tell him what type of body i'm looking for? i'm scared i'm going to sound like a twat if i tell him ""i wanna look buff as fuck""

facebook accentuates that feeling like crazy. i constantly see people getting tons of happy birthday posts on facebook, whereas the only ones to wish me a happy birthday are my parents. i tried posting something the other day and the only people to acknowledge my post was my parents. 

all around me i see people receiving  and sending texts all the time. however i never receive any texts and only get answers at least a couple of days later when i send a text. that way they show me they don't have time for me.

after looking at some profiles of colleagues of mine on linkedin, i realised they all gave themselves recommendations on their skills. i have never received any, despite giving many.

at work i see plenty of people chat with each other on skype and slack, yet i am part of none of those conversations, besides the professional oriented ones.

i hear guys and girls at work talk about having tried tinder and online dating sites with success. i've tried both and never had a match or message.

i even once posted to r/depression a few years back, when i was very low. no comment was ever posted.

if it weren't for my parents i'd be completely invisible. whether i try hard or not at all, the result remains the same.

when i told my parents the first thing they said was 'we aren't helping you pay for it'. first of all, they didn't help me pay for my bachelor's degree so i never expected them to help me with the next step of my education. second, i have worked my butt off since i was 14 so that i could go to school because they refused help with my education.

that isn't even the worst of it though. they then proceeded to tell me i won't make it through school because i have anxiety and depression (which was a result of how they raised me). i suffered with mental illness for a long time and went untreated because they would not let me talk to a counselor or doctor about my problems. thank god for turning 18 (i'm now 22)

but over the past 200 or so battles my wr has been 49% with a wn8 of just over 1500. it's like i've forgotten everything i learned in the last year or more. i make terrible decisions. i get impatient or over-aggressive and die horribly (which was my biggest flaw as a player for a long time). then i overcompensate and end up playing too passively. things that normally work blow up in my face instead. i get spotted in bushes that are usually safe. then i think, ""ok, the light/medium mojo isn't there right now, so let's try the armor and firepower approach instead,"" and end up heat spammed to death by wz-111 5as and 268 v4s that i can't even see. arty can't seem to miss me. i'm getting rage from teammates about blowing games. (that typically comes from dead tomatoes who haven't exactly covered themselves in glory. normally i wouldn't pay any attention, but in context i'm starting to question whether they may be right.) i find myself getting drawn into chat drama much more than i usually would, because my patience has worn thin.  

so, how do i turn this around? the advice *i'd* usually give someone asking this question would be to take a break from the game. but i just came back from a break that lasted almost three months! (i did some pretty hard grinding from mid-october through mid-january, and got a little burnt out.) i've only been back a couple weeks. and while 200 battles may not be a large enough sample to prove that i'm headed back to potatoville, it sure *feels* like a large sample. i've tried playing my go-to fun tanks like the kv-2 and derp sherman, with meh results. ditto for the su-122-44, with the added bonus of watching my moe percentage fall from 93% to 89%. 

so come on, reddit. spill your secrets. what do i do? drugs? alcohol? human sacrifice? make an alt account and get all the shitty play out of my system on that, then return to the main when--hopefully it's a matter of when, and not if--i'm through it?

(i say ""seems"" because he hasn't been formally diagnosed.) the sounds that seem to really trigger him are chewing, lip-smacking, or any of the normal sounds associated with eating. he snaps at me, his mother, and his siblings about this several times a day. i really don't know what to do about it. we live in a relatively small home, and we're all entitled to eat. what's more, we prefer to have a meal together as a family at least *most* evenings. i don't want time at home with family to be a terrible experience for him, but i also don't want him to eat every meal alone, and i don't feel like it's practical to expect that five other people will sneak away into the laundry room or something every time they have a snack. (it doesn't matter how quietly we try to eat. it makes no difference. it's almost as if the mere fact that he knows we're eating is enough to trigger him.)

7nb829,is the maus worth it?,1.0,23.0,21.0,WorldofTanks,"i'm nearly finished with the vk100.01 grind. with a little effort i'm sure i can have the maus in my garage by the end of the current on track event. however, i'm starting to wonder if i want it. 

i have not enjoyed the vk. my biggest complaint is the poor mobility, which i find very limiting. and while the armor is obviously quite good for a tier 8 heavy in many respects, the prominent weak spots and the ease with which the vk can be flanked do limit its effectiveness. finally, the simple things you can do to help protect the weak spots--constant movement, basically--aggravate the poor gun handling.

i've had the e100 for years, and while its mobility is my least favorite part of the tank, i've learned to live with it. (one can find a lot of solace in 750 alpha with 340 heat pen.) i guess in the back of my mind i always had the idea that the maus's mobility was pretty similar to the e100's. however, after looking more closely, i now realize that the entire maus line from tier 8 up is noticeably less mobile than the e100, and in fact all three--vk, mauschen, maus--are very similar to one another in that respect. in other words, mobility-wise, things aren't going to get better from here on out. that worries me. on the other hand, the maus does have much improved armor, firepower, and gun handling compared to the vk. 

in short, i'm wondering whether those upgrades make the maus's mobility tolerable. i realize it's a subjective question; i'm just asking for opinions. i know the ideal thing to do would be to to play the maus on the test server, but i don't think that'll be an option before the on track ends.

most tier 9 and 10 heavies' standard rounds will pen the frontal turret weak spots pretty reliably at close range. the things that i try to do to mitigate that--things like rocking and wiggling the turret, or trying to sidescrape at medium range--work to some extent, but they aggravate the problems with the derpy gun. 

in most normal tier 8 heavies, if i feel like i'm too badly outclassed by the enemy's higher tier heavies, i'll often go fight their meds instead. but the 100.01p is just too slow for that on most maps.

(being realistic, i know i'll never get the obj. 260.) my reasoning for using the gwp is that a tier 8 has the best chance to accumulate xp by shooting higher tier tanks, and the gwp has the highest alpha, max stun duration and (iirc) splash of all tier 8s. the latter two, at least, should be helpful for the stun aspect of the mission. do you think this is the wrong choice of spg? obviously the reload, aim time, and accuracy do handicap it in some respects.",2756.0,394.0,0.57,2017-09-28 20:25:02,Marshalmatt,0.0,0.0,2.0,1082.0,207.0

""another particularly painful point that you brought up was one-sided, boring games composed of two teams that were vastly different in vehicle composition. let’s say two tank destroyers in a team against seven in the opposing. you can guess the result from the get-go, which kind of wipes the smile off your face and makes you want to quit (unless you’re on the winning side, of course, but even winning is little fun when it comes easy). this would happen because the old matchmaker used to balance a team by the number of scouts and arty. the other classes would get distributed randomly.

619w43,what ticks me off about the proposed plan for tier 8 lt xp...,6.0,29.0,61.0,WorldofTanks,"....is that many of us who have been grinding tier 8 light tank xp have been doing so because *wg's own past practice* indicated that we'd be able to carry that xp forward to tier 9. so it feels a little like we've been suckered, and i hope wg will reconsider its approach. 

going back to 7.3, which was the first or second patch after i started playing, i can think of no previous case in which tanks were uptiered but their xp stayed behind at the lower tier, the exception being tanks that were being tiered up to 10. and even then, wg didn't try to force undistributed xp to become free xp, at least that i recall. for example, when the is-4 moved from 9 to 10, its xp transferred to the is-8, which was introduced in that same patch and was in a completely different line of the tech tree. but everyone with a tier 9 is-4 received an elited tier 10 is-4, so moving the xp up to tier 10 with the is-4 would've turned it into free xp. rather than do that, wg moved it to a place where it could be used at no cost.
 
in every other case i can remember--kv to kv-2, kv-3 moving from 6 to 7, introduction of tier 10 arty, amx 12t moving to tier 6--the xp has moved up with the vehicle. so many of us who have been grinding xp on our tier 8 lights have been doing so with the perfectly reasonable expectation that wg would again follow its long-established practice in this instance.  

i'm not arguing that it's inherently unfair to require people to either grind through a 9 to get the 10, or spend free xp on it. i can see the argument that it's unfair to newer players to require that of them, but not of players who happen to have tier 8 lts in hte garage at the time of the patch. but *that is not what wg has done in the past*, and if they were going to change their consistent past practice they should've announced it well in advance, so players could make informed decisions about how to allocate their time, personal reserves, etc. 

it's not as if wg might not have realized that people were drooling over the tier 10 lts and grinding like mad. the hype has been real. so this feels a little bit like a setup. again, i hope wg will rethink it. they have sometimes rethought past missteps in time to avoid them, so there's hope.

5lv6n5,ever wondered what wr you'd get if you suicided immediately at the start of every battle?,79.0,65.0,89.0,WorldofTanks,"probably not. but in case you have, the apparent answer is 43%.

a week or so ago i ran into a guy in a maus with 30,000 battles, a double-digit wn8 (i'm serious: it was something like 38), and a 43% overall wr. we were on paris. he went to the northeast corner with the tds and lts, and just sat there all battle. he died having done 0 damage. after the battle i couldn't help being curious, so i pmed him and asked if an actual human played that battle, or if it was a bot. he responded and said no, it was really him. he claimed he'd never used a bot program. apparently, during every battle before tier 10 he committed suicide immediately at the start of the battle just to ""climb the tech tree to the good tanks"" as fast as possible. (i didn't get into the logic of that thinking with him, although i did point out that there are lots of good tanks below tier 10.) he admitted that he had only recently learned how to switch ammo types. 

so there you go. 43%. now you know.

3xx3ld,improving team play,4.0,14.0,19.0,RDDT0,"i've noticed a few things we could probably do better in team battles, which might improve our success rate. i know i'm a relatively new guy, and frankly i've been solopubbing so long that i'm not great at playing as part of a team. so tifiw. these aren't criticisms; just suggestions. some of you may not agree that there's room for improvement in some of these, or that they are worth worrying about; that's fine. it's just food for thought.

(1) focusing fire. we talk about it, but don't always execute well. might help if the callers designated targets with the t/f2 keys, or by name. hard to do in the heat of battle, but i gather the uni clans do it this way.

(2) spreading/sharing damage. the opposite of focusing fire. when someone takes damage, teammates with higher hp need to shield him and keep his gun in the game as long as possible. again, much easier said than done, but something that might be worth working on. 

(3) clarity in instructions. a couple extra words can make all the difference. don't assume everyone knows ""the usual strat."" and any extra details the caller can add to orders like ""push"" can be helpful. don't be afraid to click the map.

(4) radio silence. it's hard to come up with bright line rules here, because it's often necessary to talk to relay important information. but unnecessary chatter interferes with communication. save it for the garage and the queue, unless we're just goofing off.

&#x200b;

i feel like i'm living life as if on autopilot, and not truly experiencing the world and my surroundings. my brain 'feels' like it's numb in a way, like its almost totally shut down most of the time and only the bare minimum is being used for daily living. i don't have 'active' conscious thoughts on things in my daily life, whether it be schoolwork, people, or other things- in fact i hardly seem to notice anything at all. almost everything that i see seems to hardly register with my brain, and it feels like i'm not actually focusing on anything or being aware of my surroundings. if i inspect something or do something like schoolwork, i can't seem to consciously register it, it seems like its out of focus and my brain seems to be sleeping. 

&#x200b;

also i don't feel anything at all anymore, except for brief periods of shock/ fear/ anxiety or jealousy, but nothing else. its not like i feel sad all the time, i literally don't \*feel\* anything at all. i also never any emotions like anger or happiness most of the time, and i guess its connected to my lack of focusing on anything. i can't seem to get excited for anything, and my lack of concern is hurting my grades since i can't seem to care about my schoolwork. this is the exact opposite of when i was younger, where i was really eager to learn and looked forward to things.

apbkjm,millennials and generation z’s are actually way better than their older counterparts.,75.0,36.0,85.0,unpopularopinion,"to start, i am smack dab in the middle of gen z. thought y’all should know that.

it is well known that millennials especially get a lot of shit.

but i don’t think it’s justified. yeah some of them are lazy and entitled, and expect the world to hand everything to them. 

but isn’t that part of every generation? there will always be freeloaders, and there will always be bums who don’t contribute. it’s part of life.

so instead of seeing these generations for their worst, let’s take a look at the average millennial and gen z from a wholistic view. 

here’s a few points that older baby boomers and gen x’ers make about the younger generation. 

1. we don’t manage our money well. what older folks fail to realize is that not many young people manage their money effectively. it’s part of being young. the truth is that millennials are saving more and more than most. here’s a forbes article on the subject. 

http://amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2018/01/24/millennials-saving-money

2. millennials and gen z’ers are selfish and don’t care about anyone but themselves. how about no? we are the first generations to actually give a fuck about climate change. more green energy has come about than any point in time because we care. additionally millennials actually volunteer more, at a younger age. considering the fact that at this time millennials have less time on their hands than their older counterparts, it’s actually quite impressive. 

https://medium.com/unself/millennial-volunteerism-4c472c7fce4d

3. millennials are a bunch of special snowflakes who want free handouts all the time. one of my favorite things was how older generations make fun of participation trophies that millennials got as a kid. they never stop and think who the people giving out participation trophies were lol. let’s also understand that scientific advancements in psychology and neurology as shown that things the older folks disparaged (race, homosexuality, depression, “cowardness”— actually ptsd, anxiety) are either not as important as they said, or more important than they gave credit for.

4. millennials and gen z’ers are by far less racist than baby boomers and gen x’ers. this can be easily seen. granted kids can grow up to be indoctrinated to believe racial stereotypes. but as a person who moved from a small white tow to the city, i truly see almost no lines between white and black students on my campus. everywhere i go, i see interracial couples, friends, friend groups all enjoying life together. which is how it should be. 

https://medium.com/writers-guild/five-big-differences-between-millennials-and-gen-z-that-you-need-to-know-fdefb607fc41

i like how this article describes race. how interracial relationships are the new norm. it really is true and the future is looking up from this.

5. millennials and gen z’ers are naive to the way the world works. maybe we’re naive to the way **their** world works. but in our world, the environment matters. helping others matters. and keeping the world safe for future generations matter. reckless use of things like agent orange, and carcinogens is not going to be as prevalent as society progresses. in fact, with how much the silent generation, baby boomers, and genx’ers fucked up the earth, i would say that they are the ones who didn’t understand the way the world works in a very literal sense. 

https://amp.businessinsider.com/baby-boomers-millennials-climate-change-generations-2017-7

so with all of those points. it think it’s safe to say that millennials and gen z’ers get a bad rep. 

i’m kinda hungry for some avacado toast now 😉

[edit] 

my point isn’t if millennials are objectively good, or that they are perfect. but for sure i am saying they did and are doing better than previous generations. 

few points: 

1. two world wars? really? come on! i think it’s quite clear where blind nationalism gets people. 

2. older generations can’t complain about ya wanting free college, when their cost adjusted for inflation for 4 years is the same as 1 semester for me. bullshit. i’ll take your tax money please. it’s their fault that it’s as high as that anyway. 

3. it’s wildly ironic that baby boomers call **us** selfish when medicare and medicaid account for a massive part of the budget. considering 75% of spending goes to chronic diseases in which over 95% of chronic diseases are for those over 65. we are literally spending billions to keep you old pieces of shit alive. even after y’all fucked our environment and economy. 

4. imo, fucking over the environment to drive an suv is absolutely selfish. telling poor people to “just get a job” while at the same time not wanting the minimum wage raised to adjust for inflation is selfish. wanting to cut programs to the arts because you don’t value it like the younger generations do is selfish. let’s not forget that y’all ignored what the nasa chairman said as “indisputable proof of climate change” for 30 fucking years. and then you elected a president who doesn’t even believe in climate change. 

**you are literally jeopardizing your grandchildren’s future. not to mention the future of humanity**

but who cares? there’s some poor disparaged people wanting some food, and we’ve got a wall to build to keep their mouths empty and my pockets full! jesus loves you though!

honestly, that nice starbucks coffee i manage to treat myself to once a month when i get a little ahead of my student loans isn’t looking all that terrible now. 

my point is this: you can’t rag on an entire generation for being “entitled” when your same generation kept in place the very policies that caused all the problems today.",2521.0,8440.0,0.82,2019-02-11 04:37:03,VeganAteMyMeat,0.0,0.0,12.0,5636.0,918.0
apa28r,aborting children because of their down syndrome isn’t mercy killing. it is monstrous.,0.0,24.0,86.0,unpopularopinion,"my brother has high functioning autism. he is much older than me so i didn’t notice it until i was older myself. 

i grew up going to therapy sessions with my mom when i was little. over time i quickly realized at an early age that people with disabilities are just as capable of a wonderful life as we are.

i’ve been hearing a lot of people say that they would have aborted their child if they knew they would be disabled. or that countries like iceland are right to abort children with down syndrome.

https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/iceland-downs-syndrome-no-children-born-first-country-world-screening-a7895996.html

there’s a few things people don’t understand about down syndrome. 

1. people with ds are just as able to keep up with normal learning as other kids. one of the people in my school had down syndrome. he learned how to keep up with regular courses, even taking a few ap and ib courses along the way.
2. people with ds are able to experience love and have familial connections like anyone else. they have complex emotions and feelings just like we do. i remember being a camp counselor for a child with ds. he was the sweetest person in the world, and honestly deserved more recognition for his character than any of the other campers. he was more human that what we call a “normal human”
3. aborting someone because of their disability only now increased discrimination against those born with those disabilities. iceland now has a real social stigma against people with down syndrome. how hellish it must be for mothers who still love their child, but give in to social pressure.

aborting children because of their type of disability dehumanizes them. 

they are now unfit to live because of a genetic code they did not choose. that actually sickens me. 

how do you think a person with down syndrome would feel if they were told that they should have been aborted? i would dare say that most wouldn’t ha e the heart to say it to their face. or their parents.

anwsas,why did disney erase the “old republic” eu?,0.0,19.0,43.0,StarWars,"just wondering how it made sense to erase the old republic eu.

here’s a few points: 

1. i totally agree with erasing the eu after episode 6. mostly because it was a huge mess and made no sense and had no real story arc. there were a few good ideas (powerful alien races from other galaxies) but for the most part a lot of the books were bland and not cohesive

2. the old republic eu strengthened a lot of themes about the prequels. ie, the moral ambiguity of the jedi vs the sith conflict, and the later clone wars. 

3. the story of revan and malak is actually awesome. it’s personally one of my favorite star wars stories. the kotor and swtor universes were incredible. the story arc and character development is actually amazing

4. imagine a movie detailing events of the old republic, before the “rule of two” where we could have seen massive battles between hoards of sith and jedi. it would have been amazing 

5. the old republic events really don’t effect too many things with the new trilogy, as the jedi in a sense don’t really exist as they once did, and the sith really aren’t too much of a thing anymore either. it’s more about the struggle between light and dark. 

i would have loved a movie on this subject. i get that disney wanted to write their own story, which is fine. but i don’t understand the need to blanket remove the eu.

ano3o7,george lucas really blurred the lines between good and evil in the clone wars tv series.,0.0,50.0,88.0,StarWars,"i’m rewatching some of the clone wars series, which was produced and directed by george lucas.

there’s a lot of themes expanded on that don’t get enough exposure in the movies. 

but i’ve come to realize that the lines were really blurred between what’s right and what’s wrong in view of the jedi. 

to me it seems like a historical perspective thing. remember how it says “a long time ago in a galaxy far far away”? 

that means we’re seeing history from a perspective. and that can be warped. especially because the perspective we see is from the jedi. 

mace windu said “the force works in mysterious ways” and that ashoka’s trial made her a better jedi in the end. 

to me this closely mimics the terminology used by most christians when something bad happens. how many times have we heard a christian say “god works in mysterious ways” and “these bad things just made you a stronger person” 

ashoka leaves the jedi order after this. because she can’t accept that her closest people, her family, cast her out like this. 

and knowing the jedi are a religion, which very much mimics christianity in many forms, i wonder how much of what we are seeing is influenced by perspective bias. 

the separatists themselves weren’t evil. a lot of them were made up of smaller systems wanting certain freedoms and representation. yes, count douku was an awful person, and so was sidious, but the movement itself had nothing to do with the sith, just as the republic entering the war didn’t either. 

(you could say both sides were technically motivated but on the outside to everyone else that wasn’t the case)

people fail to realize that sidious was behind all of the jedi’s maneuvers as generals during the clone wars. 

so how much evil and pain did the jedi cause? i mean, they enforced what the separatists called a tyrannical government and were responsible as the separatists were for civilian casualties. 

and as yoda said in the ot, “the jedi only exists to defend and protect, never to attack” 

if this is true, then how could the jedi go to war? 

my point is that the jedi for the most part fundamentally went against what they stood for since the beginning. they became war mongers and stopped being in tune with the force. 

i draw parallels to how the catholic church participated in crusades. they massacred entire villages in the name of god. they went against their own teaching to turn the other cheek and be meek and gentle. 

same with the jedi. it’s why i believe george included these motifs into the series. 

there’s also the moral questions raised in the show on whether or not it is right to use clones (who have sentience) as virtual slave soldiers. i don’t think it is right and is kinda sick for the jedi to support it. 

there’s also examples of jedi using the dark side and never actually fully becoming a sith. 

for example, windu was a jedi, but he was also capable of using the dark side. so was a few other jedi in legends. one even coming up with a light side version of force lightning. ashoka isn’t a jedi, but is quite in tune with the force and is still good. 

the witches of cannondor (i think that’s what it’s called) are pretty evil yet still aren’t really sith. 

and even darth maul, by his death, reveals that deep down he hated the sith, and hoped for the sith to be destroyed by the chosen one. 

my point is that i don’t think george lucas intended star wars to be black and white. i mean, even in the ot, luke still sensed good in darth vader of all people. that was the entire point of episode 6. 

so it’s say all jedi are good. anything else is bad just isn’t factually correct. it ignores the really deep questions lucas asks in all of his movies.",2521.0,8440.0,0.46,2019-02-06 08:48:46,VeganAteMyMeat,0.0,0.0,16.0,3702.0,667.0

let’s face it. the patriots led by tom brady are the best football team to ever grace the nfl. it’s fucking insane how many super bowls they have won in recent history. 

tom brady can literally make brass knuckles out of his spare five super bowl rings. if that’s not badass i don’t know what is. 

and i don’t understand all the hate there is against the team. granted i’m not a patriots fan, i definitely would like to see them win another super bowl with tom brady at the helm, because it’s fucking history being made. 

saying the patriots shouldn’t win the super bowl is like saying michael phelps shouldn’t win a gold medal at the olympic s because he’s too good. the fact is, he made world history and we had the privilege to watch it.

amrrcd,"beats, airpods, and bose speakers are not good quality.",56.0,41.0,55.0,unpopularopinion,"they just aren’t.

1. **beats** beats can be made for $30 by simply making them yourself. dr dre is the only reason they are expensive. saying beats are good inherently is the same thing as saying a song where dre shouts his name is inherently good. 

beats also have really sucky bass and are trash when trying to mix and produce music. 

2. **airpods** airpods have almost the same sound quality as the earbuds that come with all iphones. there is almost no difference. and honestly they can look kinda dopey if not put in exactly the correct way. (ie the ends sticking out a little too far) 

they are only expensive because if the vibration sensors on them (which dont even work all the time) and the seamless capability with apple. but just as headphones, they aren’t super high quality. 

3. bose **speakers** don’t have nearly the amount of bass and depth that speakers of that caliber should have. for $300 i can buy a set of bose speakers. but for $300 i can also buy an amazingly good sounding acoustic guitar amp that can do just the job a bose can (fishman lbc) 

so here’s what i think is good. 

1. jbl speakers. their bass capability and mid capability is impressive 

2. sony. they are just the standard for quality. period.

almhrc,i need answers. i’m losing faith.,3.0,36.0,33.0,Christianity,"my girlfriend told me recently that she has been contemplating suicide. she’s undiagnosed but i know for a fact that she has clinical depression. 

i can see it all the time. it’s like she two different people. we’ll be having a great day and all the sudden she will shrink back and be almost non responsive. 

she doesn’t deserve this. she is the most sweet and gentle people i know. she loves others with everything she has, and she always puts others first. she makes every effort to be the best she can be with me. 

she has a great life, and there’s no reason besides a chemical imbalance of the brain for her to feel this way. 

a good god wouldn’t torture her with depression and suicide. it just sickens me. and there’s nothing i have done to deserve the emotional torture that one day, i may be horrified to see that she is no longer with me.

i’m still a christian. but each day, it’s getting harder and harder for me to reconcile these things.

i’m sick of hearing “it’s all in god’s plan” and “god still loves you!” because i would never do this to someone i love. i couldn’t imagine it.  i’m sick of hearing “we all deserve to die because of our sin anyway” 

no baby deserves to be born with a genetic disorder. no little child deserves to go through panic attacks from an early age. no person deserves to suffer from autism. i can’t find anything in the bible to reconcile this.

akx1kh,my breakfast preferences,7.0,3.0,24.0,unpopularopinion,"so i’ve made a lot of serious posts on here. now it’s time to really be vulnerable. i am the most unpopular breakfast eater in my family. and here’s why: 

1. **i actually like the taste of orange juice after brushing my teeth**. idk why, most hate it, but i actually don’t mind, and low key enjoy it. 

2. **sometimes i mix cereals**. who says i can’t have coco pebbles and fruity pebbles at the same time? or froot loops and cookie crisp? eating  coco pebbles and fruity pebbles makes me feel like i’m dipping fruit in chocolate. it’s awesome. the milk is a little weird but oh well

3. **i have catsup with scrambled eggs and my sausage**. i don’t know why, i’ve just always done it since i was a kid. i love the taste of it. if i don’t have catsup with it i usually have to pile on a ton of salt and pepper just to even choke it down. and with sausage... *its literally the same thing* as having catsup with a hot dog. there’s just some peppers and spices thrown in. 

4. **i don’t pour the milk first.** there’s only so low someone can go before they are beyond saving. and i’m close. but not there yet.

it’s so bad that one time years ago, i was at my best friends house. i slept over, and his mom cooked breakfast for us. when i asked for catsup his dad gave me this weird look and muttered “disgusting” and then proceeded to keep reading the newspaper. i pretended i pretended hear him and ate my eggs in peace... (and catsup). 

oh and by the way. i actually call it ketchup. i just called it the other way to trigger you all. have a nice day 😊",2521.0,8440.0,1.0,2019-01-29 07:54:21,VeganAteMyMeat,0.0,0.0,3.0,1554.0,301.0
akqvcg,lying about contraception should be considered sexual assault or rape.,543.0,118.0,70.0,unpopularopinion,"this is an unpopular opinion. if it wasn’t, there would already be strict laws prohibiting this. 

i couldn’t find the link but i remember watching a talk show host in a cringe compilation. the woman said that she married her boyfriend and he promised that he would one day be ready to have kids. this changed and she still loved her husband and asked what to do. the hold said that she should quietly stop taking her contraceptives. that’s fucked up. but the whole studio of women were cheering and laughing. obviously supporting it. the one dude in the studio looked mortified. as did i. 

but if that can go on tv and not get called out then this is definitely an unpopular opinion to a lot of people.

people over complicate this issue. it really isn’t complicated at all. the fact is that boundaries are #1 important thing to focus on in a consensual sexual relationship. 

everyone is different and the fact is that each person has things they would find uncomfortable during sex that another person would not. 

contraceptives are no different. personally, i would find sex absolutely uncomfortable for me if i was not wearing a condom. this is because without that contraceptive the risk of a baby possibly turning my life upside down is **much** higher. 

women also feel the same way about this. if a man were to agree to wear a condom, only to “stealth it” (take it off in the middle or right before sex without the woman knowing) the man would be putting the woman in a huge amount of risk that can affect the rest of her life. 

same goes for vice versa. if a woman lies about contraception before having sex with her partner, she is putting her partner in a sexual circumstance he has not consented to. 

also if a woman stops taking her contraceptives in order to deceive the man, that is also putting the man in a sexual circumstance he might otherwise not want to partake in. 

there are already laws in states such as california, that require a person to share their std medical history before having sex. so a person who has hiv cannot have sex without disclosing this information to their partner. 

the reasoning follows the same track; the partner has not consented to that sexual circumstance. 

the issue really is straight forward. does the person consent to this circumstance, or not. a person is unable to consent to a thing they do not know about, therefore making sexual acts without knowledge of certain things inherently a sexual circumstance without consent. 

https://thewalrus.ca/is-it-illegal-to-lie-about-using-contraception/

the above story lays out the issue. i believe it over complicates it, if you want my explanation on this just tell me in the comment section.

https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-aids-felony-20170315-story.html

while the above story says the penalty for knowingly distributing aids has been reduced, it still is very much illegal in california. 

my main point about all of this is that sex can have life impacting consequences. and the fact is that lying about contraceptives can be just as life impacting as an std, and therefore should be illegal.

[edit] i think a good way to explain this quickly is put perfectly by oliver wendell holmes “the right to swing my fist ends where the other man’s nose begins” the right to make my medical information private ends at the point that my medical condition can affect the well being of others. contraception applies to this. a woman should never have to tell a person if she’s on birth control, until she starts a sexual relationship with a person. 

[edit] to all you people out there saying “just wear a condom” **i’m not only talking about women who lie** if you actually read my post, you would see that both men “stealthing” and women lying about birth control is equally fucked up and should be prosecuted. 

so “just wear a condom” isn’t an argument, because that’s ignoring the female side of things. also, telling someone to “just take preventive measures” as a response to someone doing wrong is not an argument against the perpetrator. it’s literally just victim blaming. that’s it.",2521.0,8440.0,0.92,2019-01-28 21:17:26,VeganAteMyMeat,0.0,0.0,10.0,4113.0,697.0
ajymbr,kids in drag should be abolished or heavily regulated and scrutinized.,183.0,43.0,70.0,unpopularopinion,"[18, bisexual, male]

while this may not be an unpopular opinion **on this sub** i have been repeatedly shot down on the issue elsewhere. so hear me out.

i don’t know enough about the event with the 10 year old stripping at a gay bar to make a claim about whether or not it is true.

but the fact is if this is true, if a ten year old really was at a gay bar stripping, there definitely needs to be action taken against this by the gay community and everyone else. those people should be prosecuted.

this is really troubling to me. i personally don’t agree with encouraging a child to be either straight or gay. either is indoctrination.

here is my main points on the issue.

1.	⁠children should not be allowed in a place that is bar alone. (bar and grill is okay) even straight bars are not okay.
2.	⁠parents should never encourage sexuality either way. kids don’t have the capability to really figure out who they are sexually attracted to. not until they are hitting puberty. this is just biological fact for both straight people and non-straight people.
3. drag can lead to indoctrination, and it can lead to sexualizing children (even unintentionally)
4. encouraging a young child to be gender fluid at a young age is also indoctrination and not right. his own definitions on how he feels gender should be defined should be based on his experiences as a coherent teen or young adult.
5. any drag at a sexually charged event should not allow children. having near naked women and men walk out on stage followed by a child is simply putting a child in a sexual situation, therefore being child exploitation. 

my main point is this: children being involved in drag heavily encourages all of these points i listed. which makes it clear that it is not a healthy mindset for the american people to be in.

ajlpl4,wondering about this possible contradiction.,0.0,9.0,44.0,exchristian,"so god doesn’t tempt people to sin according to the bible yes? that’s explicitly stated. 
james 1:13 for reference. 

coming from the assumption that this is true, if it is proven that people are biologically inclined to be gay, isn’t that a contradiction? 

here’s what i mean. if someone is biologically gay, then their only outlet to relieve themself of this condition is to sin (under most denominations of christianity)

that means that god is tempting them to sin. here’s why. the bible says that god creates people. he designs is from the ground up. if that is true, than all pre-existing conditions are from god. (that’s already an issue by itself) 

now imagine two people. person a has an anger disorder. he has to be physically aggressive with something in order to release his energy. it’s been established that being angry isn’t inherently a sin. but winning in anger isn’t excusable. 

so, person a could simply hit a punching bag. or do kickboxing, play sports, etc. person a has an outlet for his condition that allows him to release it without sinning. anger isn’t temptation. it’s a emotion. so the bible holds true in the area of temptation to sin. 

now person b is gay. he felt attracted to males from a young age and has always been gay. the issue is that if person b acts out in his desire then he is sinning. this is because his biological condition is engineered that he is tempted to sin. 

if god designs a person to feel temptation then he is the cause for the temptation. therefore violating james 1:13.

so obviously we don’t do that. 

but the question still remains, if there is no real **explicit** condemnation of premarital sex than isn’t any interpretation based off of it simply dogma? 

the bible says to not “fornicate” but the meaning of that word has changed over time. just like “slave” or “sodomy” so using the current definition in my mind isn’t quite valid for me.

it also uses “sexual immorality” but without a clear definition of what that means, there’s no way to define it.

it would be like if i said “being intolerant isn’t a good thing. therefore we should allow pedophiles to walk free because love is love” well, most have a wildly different definition of intolerant. so i would need to define that first. 

but the bible doesn’t ever mention premarital sex by itself (in its own context) so how can i apply sexual immorality to that?

8lnhmk,on humanity achieving self-actualization,7.0,1.0,40.0,C_S_T,"i wrote this on my phone, my apologies for any typos.

on humanity achieving self actualization

in todays middle class and up american society we have security, more food than we could ever need, hot and cold water on demand, heating and air conditioning, refrigerators, cars, we have a lot of freedom to express our opinions in this democratic sociwty and we have many opportunities, to self actualize ourselves. western charities give millions in aid to less fortunate nations. on a global scale there is extremely powerful nations who have all agreed that you deserve to have human rights and mantain them, (if you haven't read the un universal declaration of human rights, i suggest you do.) and most of the members of the u.n are pro u.s and even some direct american ideals are in the universal declaration of human rights, like habeous corpus for example. the human rights draft commitee that wrote the document even was chaired by eleanor roosevelt. us americans live in the wealthiest nation in history and the most influential and powerful nation on earth, and at the surface all american ways and customs seem good, that's why this country has been a destination for immigrants since it's founding. in this country you have endless knowledge and ideas at your fingertips, and you have many opportunities and the power to achieve self actualization. but 1 in 6 americans are on drugs to combat mental illness, depression being the biggest illness. we have almost everything we need but yet due to social media and other factors we constantly feel like we want something more, something different. like what dr. jordan peterson (i do not agree with all his ideals, but he is a smart man and this quote is good) said ""we have to have a foot in order and a foot in chaos"" in order to be truely happy. and i believe middle class and up american society is taking a swim in order, leaving us unfulfilled. our entire life is an uphill climb, we are always trying to achieve and do something, the only people perfectly at peace with their current situation are practitioners of zen, and other bhuddists. so if our entire lives we are striving for something in the pursuit of happiness, will the human conscience ever really achieve self actualization? maybe. i believe folk cultures are the way to go for happiness, i believe villages are the natural human unit, but village life is growing rarer and rarer, and with the massive population we have now, how is village life ever going to prevail? well maybe if we divide our megacities into small sections where people can live their lives, go to work, school, the market etc. in the vicinity of just a few hundred people, we can have villages in cities, and happiness. of course i don't think this should be government mandated but as a society we need to confront the fact that in developing nations people are much happier, and that in high tech cities people are incredibly isolated and lonely even though they are surrounded by people. village life is the natural human unit and we need neighbors that help us amd care about us. i don't think material stimuli like heating, air conditioning and hot water are the key to the self actualization of humanity, but rather human interaction and love. i don't believe humans have ever been completely self actualized at any point in history, but i think we got pretty damn close in prehistoric times. i do believe we are heading in the opposite direction as western culture spreads to other places and megacities form, but we can maintain the village unit if we are kind to our neighbors and support locals. peace",10587.0,16191.0,0.83,2018-05-24 01:18:25,ay013523,0.0,0.0,4.0,3614.0,629.0

but then my treatment turned into abuse. for years, i haven't been able to make my script last until the next refill. every single time, i want to use it as prescribed, to live the full life i was capable of living when i used it correctly before. and every single time, i abuse it worse and worse.

the treatment has become the problem, and the help doesn't feel like it would be any help at all. if i tell the doctor, they'll take away the only thing that's ever made me feel my life is worth living. i can't live a real life without medication, and i can't seem to have medication without abusing it. i feel as though i'm living with no hope and no recourse. and i have no idea what the fuck to do about it.",10253.0,67648.0,0.8,2019-01-07 09:47:51,anonymoustradamus,0.0,0.0,9.0,1311.0,250.0

i have adhd and i've been prescribed adderall for years, but i just don't feel sufficient without being high on stimulants. i don't just mean medicated, i mean *high,* taking more than prescribed whenever i can. i feel more capable on my prescribed therapeutic dose of adderall, but i never feel complete. so i take more, and more and more until i'm finally out. 

i know that's addiction, and i don't know how to fix it. without medication i'm completely fucked on adhd.

i'm a 26 year old guy, and i really want to be a barista at starbucks. i have experience working as a barista in a barnes & noble cafe serving starbucks products, but i have never worked at a starbucks itself. 

more recently however, i have worked full-time office jobs, and done high-level technical work online. i have a college degree in a practical business-related field, and part of my concern is i may be considered overqualified. i don't know how the hiring practices work at starbucks. but if i was a hiring manager, i wouldn't waste time on a guy who would leave at the first chance to get a higher paying job. 

the thing is i just really *really* want to be a barista! i loved it so much when i was doing it! i'm a huge starbucks fanboy and the only reason why i left the cafe was because i was going to be promoted to a full-time head cashier—outside of the cafe and down into the bookstore. i want to be a barista because i enjoy it, and i was pretty darn good at it too. i love making drinks and i love the social aspect of serving customers!

i just submitted my application to be a barista at a starbucks in a big city, and i want to go in and introduce myself in person. my thinking is to go in during the week when the manager will be there, but also when it's not packed. the plan is to go in wearing blue/black jeans, with a casual-yet-put-together look, and a smile on my face. i'm really motivated to put my best foot forward.

i'm 97kg/216 pounds (34% bf), and i'm on two-month holidays.

my main priority is doing [get strong](https://www.amazon.com/get-strong-transformation-strength-using-calisthenics-ebook/dp/b071vm4fzd/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&qid=1517002240&sr=8-1&keywords=get+strong) routine, which consists of bodyweight exercises 3x a week, in the mornings.

i expect it to be quite challenging for me, since i never did any strength exercises.

but, i'm wondering if i could add a light version of if into the mix - basically lowering my caloric intake to 1000kcal 2-3 days a week (my bmr is ~3200kcal), to also lose ~1.5 pound a week.

a year ago, i did a similar regimen (1000kcal, 4 days a week for 3 months, 3500 3 days a week), and it worked perfectly. but i didn't do exercises in the meantime.

the question i have: **on what days should i do fasting, assuming, i'm doing workouts mon/wed/fri mornings**, to both achieve weight loss, and gain strength?

my instinct tells me to do fast saturday/sunday/wednesday, and do the first set of exercises on empty stomach.

from what i understand, the key to doing workouts is eating a lot of protein afterwards, and having a slight caloric surplus, so my body rebuilds the muscles.

am i right here? also - what are the chances that fasting will make it extra difficult to perform the training? the regimen i chose would be challenging/barely doable if i ate normally, and i'm slightly afraid that fasting will take that extra bit of energy that i would require to finish it.",8430.0,3310.0,1.0,2018-01-26 23:39:10,DoUHearThePeopleSing,0.0,0.0,9.0,1512.0,242.0

5x1ch3,i'm composing a list of tests to check for underlying issues that cause weight gain,4.0,25.0,83.0,loseit,"most people blame themselves and their habits for gaining weight. it's worth checking for underlying issues though, because some people don't realise that there are certain problems with their bodies.

some of the ones i found below. perhaps someone can add anything here:

**thyroid problems** - a simple bloodwork can show that

**deviated septum** - [leads to trouble sleeping](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stanford-center-for-sleep-sciences-and-medicine/sleep-apnea-and-weight-loss_b_4086426.html), and sleepiness during the day which people overcompensate with sugar. any laryngologist can check that, you will also more often breathe through mouth if you have it.

**diabetes** - if you have it, you probably know, but there are tests that can be done too.

**attention deficit** - people with adhd are twice as [likely to be overweight](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/when-your-adult-child-breaks-your-heart/201603/understanding-the-link-between-adhd-and-obesity). here's a [fun test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iozafir3bew) for it.

**narcolepsy, cataclepsy and daytime sleepiness** - while being overweight makes people tired and sleepy in general, sometimes it's the other way around. a sleep clinic might help, also asking around the family members, because these issues are genetic.

**depression** - there are two variants, one developed in life, another one genetic due to problems with serotonin management in the brain. 

all in all, for around [40-70% people](
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2570383/) (sic!) there are underlying genetic issues that caused messed up hunger in the first place. we know it because of twin studies, and because of studies on adopted children - the family they were adopted to (and their habits) mattered far less than the families they were born into.

so, many of us will have an uphill battle to fight, and it's important to know the enemy. most of the issues can also be treated or managed, and there is extremely little information on the subject anywhere.

if anyone has anything to add to the list, i'll gladly do :)

4vvbkx,hf foundation?,3.0,4.0,14.0,btcfork,"hi guys,
i'm a long-time btc investor, i launched orisi some time ago, and worked on a stealth project for the past month. recently i switched my interest into ethereum because i like that community more.

i'm also a serial entrepreneur, and people seem to value my advice often.

having said all that, i wanted to say that i wish you all the best, because i think you stand a chance on building something new and positive on top of btc.

if i may share a few ideas:

- you need to change pow into something that can't be brought down by the current btc miners. while etc avoided an attack from eth, you may not be so lucky, and a big pool might bring you down if you don't protect yourselves.

- you will need a full-time team, and a foundation - at least create an address to gather funds. long-term the winning chain will be the one with the better team, and every organisation needs full time people who get paid to do their work.

- after the fork, i get it - the new currency will have better technical part. but it will lack the network effect (just like etc does today). sure, exchanges will add it probably, but what's next? blockchain.info won't switch into you, neither will bitpay, nor the thousand webapps that currently run on btc. how can you generate that network effect? the only thing that comes to my mind today is having some kind of a bounty program to finance startups launching on your chain. that's tricky though - bounty programs didn't help windows phone get off the ground, so it may not be enough for you either

- this will be controversial, but here it comes - while you're hard-forking, why not create a new foundation address, and put like 1m new btc on it, through the fork, to pay for the future development costs? i imagine people might get angry about it, but this will give you funds to pay for future development.

i get a feeling that in order to succeed you cannot be just a bit better than the current bitcoin. you need to be an order of magnitude better. you can't just have slightly larger blocks - that will be an improvement but just a slight one. you'll need larger blocks, better pow (or perhaps pos, taking some ideas from vitalik?), and perhaps some improvements to the smart contract mechanisms?",8430.0,3310.0,0.67,2016-08-03 01:46:21,DoUHearThePeopleSing,0.0,0.0,2.0,2245.0,412.0

4ch9bn,"is it possible to read the private state of other contracts in a trustless way, using an contract similar to btcrelay?",1.0,0.0,118.0,ethereum,"me and /u/remco_ were wondering...

one of the cornerstones of smart contracts is the split between private and public memory/functions. forcing scripts to use public functions like verifytx of btcrelay ensures that contracts get paid for their work.

but now, what prevents anyone from creating ""ethrelay"" within ethereum? that ethrelay would contain a copy of headers of eth blocks, just like btcrelay.

but instead of using it to verify transactions, one would use it to snoop on private variables.

let's say that a smart contract snoopy wants to guess what's in the private memory of bob. he hires a relayer - elvira, who is a script/person outside of the blockchain, and that relayer gives snoopy all the memory of bob, and all of the bob's past function calls.

then, snoopy uses ethrelay to verify the information in a similar way that contracts today can verify txs with btcrelay. if it checks out, snoopy knows all the bob's memory contents and he knows that without trusting elvira or anyone else.

it would take a ton of gas (much more than btcrelay), but in theory - it would give contracts an option to read private data of any other contract in a trustless fashion. allowing unlimited leeching into other contracts' data.

i want to start with t-shirt, because that's the simplest thing to make. then move on to jeans & jackets. shirts&suits probably not, because tailors to that already.

i'm trying to research a subject of waking up in the middle of night. i read/heard from doctors that some of the reasons are related to a stressful life.

is an explanation provided on this page accurate?

http://www.drdeborahmd.com/do-your-adrenal-glands-wake-you-3-am

> so when there is a long period of emotional or physical stress, your 24 hour cortisol producer is working a little harder. as if it feels the need to get up a few hours early to start on what will be a big task, it starts releasing cortisol more than just a few hours before dawn. in folks undergoing chronic stress, it's not unusual to see the highest levels approaching bedtime, with everyone finally wearing out and running out of steam early afternoon. these folks find it difficult to go to sleep, or wake at 2 a.m. and can't return to sleep - and then they are exhausted in the early afternoon, thinking they will really get a good night's sleep tonight. but, alas, the adrenal gland is still thinking of 24 hour patterns, and is hard to get out of last night's pattern, even when you are very tired.

the explanation provided seems to make sense to me, but i don't trust the website / source too much - the author of the article recommends homeopathy as a solution in one place ;)

- is the explanation provided accurate?

anyway, will this all get 'smaller' in time? because when i have a grief episode, they're pretty intense (although each one is a little longer away than the one before it), and i don't know if i should expect these for the rest of my life or it's going to lessen.",400.0,59.0,1.0,2018-02-10 17:08:08,fsutrill,0.0,0.0,9.0,1572.0,309.0

8cdyn6,how xanax took a month and a half of my life away from me,49.0,35.0,57.0,Drugs,"mid january i took two xanax bars (4mg total) for the first time, after having done one bar at a time a few times. i was broke and home alone enjoying myself, probably on the internet but i cant really remember.   

what i do remember though, is that at some point i went on a drive. im not sure if i did anything before this but i ended up at walmart. keep in mind i was broke because i had recently spent the last of my money on coke and xanax. i proceeded to go into walmart and stuff my backpack with hundreds of dollars in electronics. keep in mind i did this all nonchalauntly as fuck. i remember in my head i felt like nothing could go wrong.   

as i was walking out of the store i got stopped by security and asked to empty my pack. i complied and then a minute later a cop showed up and gave me a court date. i was so fucked up that i didnt even process the fact that i just picked up a charge as i was leaving. i walked out thinking like ""wow haha i just got caught stealing and didnt even get arrested, must be kuz im white or something"".  

i then drove home, where it took my parents like 20 seconds to realise i was high as shit. being annoyed with my parents for pestering me about it, i went to grab my keys and go to a friends house. my mom was like ""oh nonono you cant drive a car right now, youre gonna kill someone"" and took my keys. i got pissed off, and then went to my room to play some games on my computer.  

a few minutes later my mom walked in and said she was gonna take away my computer. as a 19 year old this pissed me off, and i began arguing with her and blocking her from taking it (im 19 and i paid for the computer, so in my mind i was 100% confident i was in the right). well next thing i know my dad comes in, grabs my arms and pins me to my bed, sort of half laying on me. i repeatedly asked him to get off me. this turned into yelling, which turned into a struggle. my dad is a pretty buff guy, and im a skinny dude. somehow, i managed to almost push him off of me, but then he pushed back and locked me in again. at this point i was furious, and i spat in his face, freed my hands while he wiped it off, and punched him in the face. repeatedly. while screaming at him to get off me. apparently i even yelled """"ill fucking kill you you bitch"" to my dad. he punched back. i gave him a black eye, and he gave me two. after he punched me enough i stopped struggling and a moment later a cop came into my room, told my dad to get off me,  put me in cuffs and took me to jail. when i got to the jail i was still really high and i fell asleep in the holding cell. i woke up not having any idea why i was even in there, not remembering anything. when i got to make a phone call a few hours later my mom told me what i did that night and i was shocked.  

never take more than one xanax of you dont really have a tolerance. i ended up being in jail for a month and a half.  

tldr: popped two xanax bars and ended up getting caught shoplifting at walmart, and got a dv charge for punching my dad in the face.",4318.0,10370.0,0.93,2018-04-15 11:35:29,machinegecko,0.0,0.0,14.0,3041.0,629.0

apdj1i,have you been going to your psychologist for years not knowing why your issues aren't resolved?,1.0,0.0,95.0,bipolar,"i have some great insight for you guys and definitely one for food for thought.

&#x200b;

however here are first some questions to think about before reading my blurb. one that i didn't even consider as i had no one to tell me this. yet maybe if they had i would of approached my whole life and existence which led to many failed and unecessary suicide attempts not understanding the reality of why in a whole different way and would of actually been able to live a really good fucken 20 years as opposed to living it in stinky depression and harming myself in ways i could never imagine possible as ultimately as a person we do not want to hurt ourselves and we are not made for that.  even back hundreds of years ago no one was dumb enough to tie a rope around their own neck and try to end themselves over someone elses irrational thoughts as they aren't educated or have other faults and not their own.

&#x200b;

now a few important questions to ask yourself when you go to your psychologist which aren't provided to you before hand although they probably should as it then gives you a better perspective of how long it can take to resolve a personal problem.  instead of 1 year, maybe it could be 20 + years with the problem unresolved. how good is that?

&#x200b;

but on a serious note:

&#x200b;

* when you go to a psychologist how much information do you think is possible to really spill to get to the bottom of your problems if your brain has the potential to store 2.5 petabytes or a million gigabytes in today's times?  this means the information can go on dump mode for hours and hours if you allow yourself too.
* what happens if the session abruptly stops but mentally you had just started getting so comfortable you were going to spill all the critical stuff? then you leave and actually forget that thought all together to not even bring it to the following weeks session where indsight you should of?
* what if your psychologist is a lazy listener and forgets to maybe bring up something in their notes from last weeks session that would of then maybe helped you piece some of the puzzle?
* now what about if you go to that session and you are actually reserved because of something that happened that day which makes the session null and void? i.e. you may find you just repeat the same thing as you did in the last session.
* what if you are just going there because you enjoy hearing that you are right as no one gives you that luxury at home and it is all you really went in there for but deep down inside you never wanted to admit it or even dare think of that thought as it would mean you would need to be honest with your own self to then steer drastic action that you know needs to be taken?
* what if the psychologist could tell you so much more but due to certain policies they are unable to do so yet they know if they were to that they wouldn't have a job and you'd never come back again?
* did you ever stop to think and ask is the specialist even right or did you rely on what you were taught as a child that the professional is always right so of course i should just keep on listening and let them play with my life

&#x200b;

you see  a lot of pieces of the puzzle or information need to be dumped to resolve your issues. also does it not make sense to lay them all out? so you can make sense of it all and see how one event or thought in your life is linked to another which controls your depression overall? but hey you weren't allowed to see the whole puzzle and no one told you otherwise so zero results for you and off you go repeating yourself year after year. there are a lot of what if's? zero of which are told to patients before hand that makes them think and do a proper evaluation before going !!!

&#x200b;

**my story:**

i had been seeing psychologists, counsellors for the last 20 years off and on ever since i had a science teacher find me in 98 to be down in class which mind you was a result of me just being sad that day due to my own internal way of how i see things. as the reality is, some events or things that are happening in life due to no control of your own are fucken sad and are allowed to be felt that way. no one can be responsible for a way a person feels, that is not natural and it is mind control to want someone to feel happy when they are not. but sure they can steer them in the right direction.

&#x200b;

after my last very serious suicide attempt, i went back to see my psychologist in june and again same damn result. specifically she wanted me at a rehab despite me already having quit alcohol on my own after having been a chronic one sitting in parks daily for years and i knew in the past drugs and alcohol was helpful **believe it or not** as i got information out of my own self that i couldn't under other circumstances as i taught myself that way due to people who were meant to be doing their job failed to explain things properly and didn't care to think at any stage they weren't explaining the matter to themselves where it makes more sense but they were explaining it to me where i interpret things differently and now realise i need to see everything in detail before i can understand it properly as then i know i am not missing a piece of the picture. this is also why these people never got a job for writing ikea instruction guides.

as a result because of all of this the end result for me was addiction, confusion, hurt, loss of sense of identity and being frozen in time !!! it hurt a lot to be exact as i took their word as gospel and misinterpreted. yet through fear and shame of my own self i never questioned until it until i could take it no more.

&#x200b;

i said i am throwing in the fucken towel and resolving this shit storm myself. none of it makes any fucken sense and the teachings aren't working properly as i now know they are not my own. i thought i am already dead as a person and told my ownself it's ok if you die this time as it won't be in vein, it will be because you were trying to get to you who you were denied to be a very very long time ago by others, experiences and medication over the years when they counted the most.

&#x200b;

i went back in my memory scape to a time 9 years ago where life was heading in the best direction it could be but then just didn't for some reason or another. further interestingly enough at this point in life it took me to be sleep deprived and drunk to talk with a close friend late at night when people wrere asleep. when we knew no could judge to really really talk with our sessions going in depth over hours and not just 55 minutes then ending. it was baffling, it truly was. i valued those sessions more than the 10 years of seeing psychs / counsellors off and on as we were on a similar level but hey people would ill advise to do it this way and they are right. it never should have of had to get that way in the first place but due to other people's fuck ups being placed on others it happens.

i began picking myself apart 4 months ago where i have gone from identifying every single year i was alive and listed events that occured and thoughts that maybe i had at the time which influenced my decision for life to esentially end up shit and permanently shit at the help of so called experts who are only limited in their capacity to how far they can push a person where it is not harmful. but hey guess what? no pain, no gain right.

&#x200b;

looking back i would of preffered 3 intense painful months at young adulthood then going around a fucken merry go round when it all wasn't necessary to begin with. i am sure you too might find this if you let yourself. but hey putting on bandaids and living life is socially acceptable and that is why we take the pills we do.

&#x200b;

admitting a past where fuck ups were made is a hard pill to swallow. it will haunt for a period of time but then just like that you will question if you ever even had bipolar to begin with as you never even chose to be this way someone just embedded their pain onto you which set your course for life to go in that specific direction. it led you to also not knowing how to stand up for yourself when you needed to but was critical for your life as you know you were living life and it made no sense to you at the time to induce harm and sadness when it wasn't really what you were feeling at the time. as no one would surely listen to a child or young adult who knows what is best for them?

&#x200b;

the fortunate thing is once each of these past stressors are re-visited which you forgot about but hurt at the time as you kept on burying it maybe in shame with alcohol, the current medication you are on, substances and other from your own self which you protect and think no one else knows about but you and only you they are closed and closed forever.

&#x200b;

you also get to decide what to do that thought once you allow yourself to feel it and maybe experience again if needed. but you get to decide now as a mature person and not the child or teenager you were. for example life is putting on stress for you. now you can just go fishing instead and going i'll address it tomorrow as opposed to i will go drink as that numbs me and i never even thought of going fishing to deal with stress back then.

the thought also becomes closed and you get closure forever. you also get to see that if you went in an addictive path that you chose to do it that way at the time as that was one of the only few coping tools you had to deal with one of life's stressors at the time.

&#x200b;

**now go and think please, as you deserve to have your own voice first before another controls you and leads you to no where or a new merry go round!!!**

aontl4,do you ever write a list for what to do when manic or feeling positive?,14.0,4.0,71.0,bipolar,"i use these positive sessions to work on mental strength training or as i'd like to look at it, resolve and get some closure on depressive things that have not been dealt with either recently or over the last x amount of years.

&#x200b;

i take advantage of this feeling although never did in the past for the better. 

&#x200b;

i did this as the last 20 years of seeing psychologists / counsellors off and on wasn't achieving much. i also became too reliant on just using them to vent. then when they told me something i wanted to hear i'd leave the door feeling happier yet the results were always the same. same problems being unresolved etc....

&#x200b;

initially when i began doing this last year i found myself crying in a way i had never done so before. it was raw emotion.  this is because i started going very very deep into personal issues that my various psychologists would say aren't worth worrying about.

&#x200b;

as the months have progressed i have mentally become stronger 10 fold. i now barely cry. i can now happily stand and talk about any emotional event from the past and not back away. i have also gotten a better understanding on the issues that bothered me and which left me depressed. this is also due to me not correctly processing the event when it happened as i interpreted it through a childs eyes as that is what i was when it happened and my coping tools / techniques were limited back then and weren't even the right one's as my parents were never given them either. 

&#x200b;

i am nearing an end now with dealing with these issues so will look to move onto something next that is positive for when the next run of positive energy arises.

more or less i failed my undergrad as i failed some subjects 7 times in a row. the college was only ever so kind to take my money and i felt pressured to keep on going at it. now i realise this was a mistake. after a few years of this nonsense i ended up bluffing to get accepted into the masters program saying i had relevant work experience etc...this degree had no maths really and i made sure to not fail anything. so overall it holds some significant meaning to me. unfortunately i finished it in 2011 :( since then i let my life spiral downhill regrettably until i put i stop to it last year.

\- when you drink alcohol it boosts your chances of liver and kidney damage (when he saw me he knew i was an alcoholic)

\- there is discontinuation syndrome (i have been trying to get off this medication the last 2 - 3 months with his recommendation on how to taper with not much luck)

\- boosts suicidal ideation (i tried commiting suicide several times whilst on this drug. the last time being last year which was very costly to me.)

\- other....

&#x200b;

he had told me he didn't know about any of these whilst not being able to look at me in the eye. he was also not aware of   other things too.   


this made me question how many other people have been told to just take this medication without the dr knowing anything really about it except for what he was sold on by the ely lilly sales rep? it is quite sad that this stuff happens as there are lives here at stake including your own.

anky8m,it has been a week since i last used and i do not crave at all. did anyone else just find the constant crashing to be a turn off to ever use again?,12.0,14.0,147.0,StopSpeeding,"i was using for about 4 months where i would have one week on of daily use and then a week off for a tolerance break.

&#x200b;

towards the end i bought .5 grams twice and then .2 to where i am now where i don't want to use again.

&#x200b;

prior to this i last used 8 years ago. again spread over a 4 month period but i was only using on the weekend and never experienced meth properly so to say. now that i have, i am over the feeling i was so hooked on and couldn't let go of 8 years ago.

&#x200b;

i think for me meth has served its purpose or at least i got all that i was going to get out of it. it allowed me to re-evaluate my past which i found hard to deal with. unfortunately it did not provide me with a million dollar idea to go and pursue as i had hoped it would lol.

&#x200b;

now i am being mature about this and the thought of using is a big turn off which is quite bizarre. i just want to stick to leading a healthy lifestyle as i am fed up of the the crash that comes with this. it was bad enough when i was an alcoholic going through this daily but it doesn't compare to meth that is for sure. what is more ironic is i began eating healthy again because of meth.

am a week in now into recovery and despite the healthy eating and taking my daily vitamins it has been some what of a shit fight to get my sleeping right. i guess this will improve in the next few days.

&#x200b;

however what was more crushing was when the guilt inside me would brew after i finished yelling as i was always told you can't do this and this to your parents thus it would play on my conscionce. the more it played, the more harm i wanted to cause to my ownself as i felt this was the only option i had left as doing positive just didn't work either.

&#x200b;

only now as an adult in my mid 30's do i realise how much this is a lie to one self. how dare i even think i don't have a voice at whatever age but more so as an adult. 

&#x200b;

how dare i even let someone's wrong become my way of life out guilt as they have thrown their title in front of me. even worse how dare i do it to my ownself when i knew they were still wrong and i was right.

it is absolutely painful thinking about the harm i caused to myself and then being told how stupid i am for doing that. i genuinely wish i could take back the time to re-do this all again but i cannot.

\- side effect is suicide ideation (i ended up having a nervous breakdown last year and tried to overdose on 4 grams of cocaine.)

\- the drug itself a has a dyscontinuation syndrome with it. meaning it is fucken really really hard to get off it. some people even switch meds to get off it. like i was a chronic alcoholic until last year when i had a nervous breakdown and have tried several times to get off it but the withdrawal is something worse.

this is why i now despise these types of meds as being on them for the last 9 - 10 years they haven't resolved jack fucken shit but even made it some what worse as i've achieved very little with it. in fact it gave me side effects. fuck i shouldn't of even taken it and should of just stuck with drinking, at least then i could of felt the depression more from drinking and i would of quit on my own. but oh fucken no these meds the piece of shit just numbed that hangover every fucken morning for me so that i thought this is alright.

it is so sad that i gave up 8 years ago after completing that masters. i still remember before even doing it i had been trying to do an undergraduate course at my parents insistence where i ended up failing a few subjects 7 times in a row. fuck knows why the college even let me keep on going. after many years i wrote a letter to the director addressing this to make sure it never happens again as it is beyond slack doing that to someone and taking close to $2000 every go knowing full well that paper ain't going to be worth nothing. 

&#x200b;

since getting the first job with the masters, my illness got in the way but then again i was drinking then too which only made it worse. after this i just kept on drifting and being depressed on my own in the park till late at night drinking away.

&#x200b;

i should of known when i was in first grade at school when i just used to sit on this log always on my own away from others what my life was going to be looking like long term.

&#x200b;

the thing is as i grew older, late high school and early college i had a lot a lot of so called friends. unfortunately again it was too overwhelming for me. this then led me to disconnect from those 300 or so people i knew and just hang out with the guys from my old high school who were known as the reject kids. the one's that just smoked weed or drank. some how i could relate more to them then the fake bunch.

i was playing smite last night and during queues i was browsing reddit and i came across a post about depression and that got me thinking.. who is the god of depression? oizys is the greek goddess of depression and is the daughter of nyx or nox. 
throughout the day i thought about this came up with idea. if oizys was to be released then hi-rez could have this event where say, there's 3 skins on release that you could get, but for each skin bought a certain amount or all of it would go to 3 different charities catering to depression and suicide. if you don't want all 3 then you can pick what ones you want and get a choice of which charity you want to donate to. 
as far as class and abilities i have no idea, but i have a few things in mind, mainly the ultimate. as far as full effect goes i don't know but a passive on the ult could be something like ""the enemy god hit will lose health every time it uses an ability for a certain time, can only be ended early by a teammate heal"" which could show how people feel with depression, and the teammate healing is the seeking help. 
oizys could be a assassin, warrior or melee mage, to signify physical pain people can suffer, i'm not sure. 

i was thinking we could pay tribute and show we care about people with depression. they are not alone, many of us in the smite community have depression and some of us,(like myself) escape theirs by playing smite. i think introducing oizys during a charity event would be great for the community.

i am nearing thirty and i'm the type of person who still isn't sure whether or not she wants kids. i live a busy life already and i value my alone time, not to mention i still have self esteem issues to work out. my significant other says that we don't have to have kids if we don't want to so i don't have to worry about that.

i would be fine with deciding not to have a kid except for this one issue: i have been reading news articles about how countries like germany and japan are facing a crisis because not enough people are having children. they need young people to go into the workforce and use their tax dollars to support the elderly and poor in their country. the only other option would be to get immigrants to do that work but a country can only take so many immigrants and another country can only lose so many people. granted, i live in the united states, where the social safety net isn't as robust and we have plenty of immigrants, but we still have social security to worry about. i think of the ways in which i would be doing myself and society a favor by not having a kid but the negative societal implications of not having children still bite at the back of my mind.

6wnvif,i am a little skeptical of so many kids identifying as transgender,113.0,49.0,66.0,unpopularopinion,"**tl;dr:** kids shouldn’t be so quick to assume that they’re transgender/agender and we should encourage gender non-conformity, not matter what genitals you have.

first of all, let me just start out by saying that i am a liberal-minded person. i am tolerant of transgender people and believe that they should identify as the gender that they are comfortable with. i know that gender dysphoria is a thing and that there is scientific evidence in the form of [brain scans](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/) to back this up. i also know that sometimes, hormone therapy, surgery and legally changing one’s name are the best treatments for those suffering from gender dysphoria. if you’re willing to go through something that big, i applaud you. you are a braver person than i.

with that said, i am a tad worried about how society is reacting toward the subject of trans rights, especially the children who are exposed to it. there appears to be a spaghetti-thin line between being transgender and simply being gender-non-conformist. it breaks my heart whenever i read that children are declaring themselves to be the opposite gender just because they don’t act the way that kids of their gender are supposed to act. i especially think that the parents are going too far when they agree to give hormone treatments to kids whose ages aren’t even in the double digits yet. the idea that there is a threshold of how masculine a girl could be before she is no longer a girl and how feminine a boy can be before he is no longer a boy is not what our feminist foremothers fought for.

transgender people only make up 0.3% of the population but websites like tumblr make it seem like it’s much more than that. there are all these kids and teens who think that they are transgender/agender/polygender/crustacean online these days and a lot of these kids have yet to take a college-level sociology course. if they did, they would know that, although gender has a little bit of a biological component (as the brain scan studies above suggest), a large chunk of it is socially constructed. nothing in nature dictates that men cannot wear skirts and women cannot enjoy pine-scented body spray. hell, one of the things that i admire about the gay rights movement is that they are a group of people that are defying gender stereotypes, even if it’s only in the form of who they were dating. 

kids also have brains and personalities that change as they get older. yes, some of those cases of transgender children do end up being children who will grow into transgender adults but we will not know until then. a boy who thinks he is a girl could grow up to be a gay man. a girl who is a tomboy could grow up to become more feminine. here is a personal one: one of my earliest memories was when i was three years old and i was trying to convince my parents that i was actually a boy because i had short hair and i liked the color blue. they told me i was a girl and that was that. and you want to know how i turned out? today, i am a timid, empathetic, emotional person who like soft colors, makeup, skirts, and i would prefer a strong man to lift things that are too heavy for me. but you know what else i like? i also like pulled pork, tv shows/podcasts with bawdy humor, burping out loud (when i’m alone, that is), rock music and tv shows/video games that involve battling monsters. does this make me androgynous? hell no. i am a woman and i will remain that way until the day i die. maybe that’s why i have such a strong opinion on this subject.

what we should be teaching kids is that a) they should wait until they reach puberty and figure themselves out before doing anything drastic like taking hormones and b) we should also be teaching kids that it’s okay to defy gender norms and be whatever you want to be without labeling yourself as anything different. what we should be doing is expanding the definition of what it means to be male and female, not inventing more labels. after all, we have yet to fully realize the goals of the feminist movement and the idea is to get more girls into stem, not make them into boys first and *then* get them into stem.

6koaat,something i've been wondering about ai,4.0,10.0,38.0,Futurology,"i don't always frequent this subreddit and i don't have a college degree in any scientific field but i do like sci-fi and find whatever possible technologies that could come in the future to be fascinating. lately, we've made leaps and bounds when it comes to artificial intelligence and some of this ai is available to the public in the form of devices. we also have debates as to whether ai will surpass human intelligence and what that would mean for us.

but when we talk about ai, we mostly talk about human intelligence: the ability to talk, reason and empathize. however, before humans were human, we were just like animals: living through instinct and worrying about survival. if you think about it, animals are ""pre-programmed"" by nature. they don't need instructions when it comes to mating dances and how to build a nest or, at the very least, they don't need extensive study to do these things. sure, humans instinctively eat when they're hungry and sleep when they're tired but animals can do some amazing things without trying. human problem solving was born out of finding new ways to survive, so our goals are more or less the same as animals, just with a little more effort.

so this leads me to wonder, since the human brain is so advanced, in some ways, wouldn't it be easier to make a robot with animal intelligence first? maybe a robot that behaves like a chimpanzee?
 it could be used to study how a human brain can come to be and, therefore, help with the creation of an ai system.

however, did anyone else guess that the pregnancy was going to end in a miscarriage? i had the idea that it was going to before i read this volume. there was something in the back of my head that made it seem like it was going to happen. hazel is the narrator and it seems like she's the star of the show, so to speak. marco and alana having another baby seemed too good to be true (even though hardly anything that has been happening can be considered ""good"" in the grand scheme of things). if she were to have a sibling, she probably would have mentioned them somewhere in the narration.

6fx9fe,considering going back on bc but i have mixed feelings,1.0,3.0,54.0,birthcontrol,"so my experiences with the pill go back to my teen years when i took it to clear up my acne. starting at age 17, i stopped taking it because i thought that it was making my eyes too dry to wear contact lenses. this wasn't the case (and i ended up not wearing contacts) but i decided to not take it again until college, when my anxiety at certain life events caused my menstrual cycle to become irregular or stop completely. 

soon, enough, i became sexually active, which gave me a second reason to use it (and yes, i know that this is its intended purpose). during the times that i had sex, i had a hard time getting wet down there. in fact, one guy felt insulted that i couldn't achieve any amount of moistness. i had a hankering that it was the pill doing this for me and, when i went off it, i had no problems becoming aroused. at that point, i decided to swear off of it for good, only using barrier methods. if my period is late, i take chaste tree berry pills, which cause my period to come without fail.

however, since becoming sexually active again, i have been considering other methods. i don't want to do a iud because the insertion process is painful from what i've heard.  i have a diaphragm that i use along with a male condom when bf and i are having sex. however, i still have issues with acne and i would like a normal period with fewer cramps. ever since coming off the pill, i have heard negative things about it, e.g., the pill causes a woman's urine to make fish sterile and that it causes women to be attracted to different men than if she were off the pill. with these things in mind, as well as the vaginal dryness, is it worth taking the pill again?

the brand that i took before was apri btw

edit: the other reasons i want to go back on the pill are **to correct my period** and **heal up my acne**. i have changed the flair of this post since i have made up my mind about getting an iud and i don't want one. i remember to take pills each day, so i don't have that problem. i just want to know if the rumors i have heard about the pill are true.",18408.0,826.0,1.0,2017-06-08 02:35:21,librarygal22,0.0,0.0,10.0,2075.0,406.0

5vcle6,idea for a pokemon type,0.0,10.0,23.0,pokemon,"there are many pokemon types out there (with the latest being fairy), which makes me wonder if there are any that are left to be invented. looking back on the previous generations, i realized that there was a potential pokemon type hiding in plain site all along.

stop me if somebody has thought of this... but what if there were music-type pokemon?

these pokemon would either have instruments of their own or their bodies would double as instruments. some of them could resemble dancers. their attacks would be noise or song-based, although this goes without saying.

not only is there potential for new pokemon to come out of this but there are many pokemon from the previous generations that could be retconned as music or dual-music type, such as chatot, the whismur line, the igglybuff line and, of course, meloetta. primarina could maybe qualify if people are fine with it being water/music instead of water/fairy. there are many attacks that could be retconned as well, such as screech, sing, hyper voice and perish song.

music could be strong against water, steel (since those two things amplify noise) and psychic (since music tends to distract/manipulate the mind). it could be weak against, rock, ground (since those two things can block noise) and fairy (since fairies generally like music).

if pokemon gyms are brought back, the gym leader could be a conductor at a symphony hall and her name could be octavia, unless that's too cliche.

here are my two questions:

1. for those of you who have gone as pearl in the past, what did you do for the pearl part? did you make it out of clay? order a custom-made one online? once the pearl part is acquired, would you use some sort of body glue to stick it to your forehead?

2. for the body paint, could i get the type that is available at any party store? which kind won't slough off from sweat and other body oils? since the leather jacket in question has rolled-up sleeves, would you recommend using body paint or should i get a pair of long white gloves (since she has literal white skin)?

my ob/gyn also mentioned diaphragms and surgical caps. those sound a little less horrifying but i read that they don't have as high of a success rate and you would have to use spermicide before putting each one to use.

5o7g19,[question] not experiencing the expected effects of pot. is this normal?,8.0,29.0,72.0,saplings,"hey, all. i had started smoking weed just under a year ago. before that, the stuff i heard about the effects of weed came from jokes about stoners in television and movies. these characters usually relax while on the stuff but also hallucinate, think up insane theories, think that everything is funny or develop a craving for junk food. as a person who love philosophy and is a creative type, i'm all for any substance that can do the first two of these.

however, whenever i smoke it, i am disappointed to report that i don't have these effects. sure, it makes me relax but it does that to the point where my mind slows down, my emotions are suppressed and i have little motivation to do much besides watch youtube videos. in fact, pot is more likely to make me feel sleepy and take extra long naps when i find time on the weekend to smoke it. in fact, it would be a great thing to use before bed if i didn't go out of my way to use it while my sister is not in the apartment. is this because of the strain of pot that i'm smoking? i've heard that it was only certain types that stimulate the mind. i never asked my mom's friend what strain it is she uses (since i get it from her). or is it because pot interacts with certain medications? i am on two different kinds of antidepressants.

i just want to add that one good thing about pot is that i have virtually no worries when using it. whenever i think of something worrying, i think, ""i should be worried about this but i'm not. and i'm okay with that."" i also don't crave junk food, so there's that.",18408.0,826.0,0.8,2017-01-16 02:09:05,librarygal22,0.0,0.0,11.0,1556.0,299.0

these reasons are a) this species is culturally-conditioned to expect those in administrative or other serving roles to be female and b) they are also culturally conditioned to find the female voice to be calm and nurturing. however, this doesn't necessarily explain the toughness of the average quartz... unless they weren't tough to begin with?

let's say that she is left alone with an object and decides to leave the room. someone comes by and steals the object without her sensing it in any other way. in the time before she re-enters the room, do all her predictions about that object involve the object having been stolen and thus she knows that the object was stolen without using her other senses? or do some of her possible futures involve the object still being there since she hasn't found out about it being stolen yet? if it is the former, does this mean that it is impossible to trick her? if it is the later, does this mean that her future vision no different than regular, non-magical prediction-making?

4oo96a,some advice for a fantasy/sci-fi story i'm writing,1.0,23.0,50.0,writing,"right now, i am writing a fantasy/sci-fi story involving a man who travels across the ocean in his spy work for his country's central intelligence agency. he discovers that the perceptions of this nation in question were wrong and instead of finding a place that is deemed evil by his society, he finds one that is comparatively utopian, i.e. it still has some flaws but it is infinitely better than the society where he came from.

creating a society is hard, especially if you're trying to explain why certain things about it are the way they are. this society in question has low rates of poverty, crime and environmental degradation and my explanation would be that it is because it has a three-fold economy: one powered by money, barter and magic. 

people in this country are able to use magic to provide for their own needs but they eventually run out for the day and have to wait until tomorrow for it to be replenished, which is why money is still necessary. money is also necessary because people are only ever skilled in one form of magic. because they don't need to rely on money too much, they only have to work twenty hours a week and often share their position with someone else who works on the days that they have off. on their days off, people use this time to pursue artistic endeavors, further education and bond with friends and family. there are government workers who use their magic to replenish the soil in populated areas and public spaces for their orchards, where people can pick fruits and vegetables that quickly replenish themselves. this isn't a communist society, though. business and private property still exist, although each neighborhood has a communal yard that is shared with the other neighbors. 

i'm loosely basing this concept off of the real life idea of a resource-based economy, a hypothetical future economy where resources become so plentiful that the cost goes down to the point where money doesn't need to be used anymore. obviously, this society is not at this point, although magical advancement could further this goal. the daily allowance of magic that each person's body produces is based off of the idea of universal basic income, which i'm sure you guys have heard about on other reddit boards. i was thinking that their taxes could either be low (since public services could be ""funded"" by workers' and ceo's magic supply) or certain things created by either magic or trading could be converted into money for taxes.

i am still thinking about how certain other aspects of this society could run, especially since i am far from being an economist. for instance, could people have local food for free (grown by public orchards) and use their money to buy imported food? how much of the technology would be magical versus non-magical? i've been reading utopian fiction to get some ideas, with my latest book being ""the dispossessed"" by ursula k. le guin.

4n8jbg,is the world ready for steven universe action figures?,6.0,8.0,54.0,stevenuniverse,"this is a thought piece that i posted on [tumblr](http://diamondbrickroad.tumblr.com/post/145634908070/is-the-world-ready-for-steven-universe-action) but i'd be happy to post it here as well.

is the world ready for steven universe action figures? personally, i am. i’d buy the hell out of them and proudly display them on my desk at work. but the real answer is, is the toy industry and the public at large ready for steven universe action figures?

one thing that we’ve known for a while about the toy industry is that it is heavily gendered. there are sections of department stores painted red and blue for boys’ toys and pink for girls’ toys. among other reasons, one reason why steven universe probably wouldn’t have been green-lit several decades ago is because the show has an identity that doesn’t fit into a gender category when it comes to merchandising. it’s about a tween boy who tries to save the world through pacifistic means along with his female mentors who physically fight their enemies. it has themes, characters and writing that not only appeal to many age groups but to many genders (especially since one character, stevonnie, is suggested to be gender-fluid).

the series already has merchandise. things like pop! figurines and clothing can appeal to anyone, though.

but what about action figures? from the get-go, action figures were boys’ toys. in fact, the marketers behind gi joe coined the term because they didn’t want to call it a doll. garnet, amethyst and pearl are written so that it would make sense to have action figures but here’s the thing: these are shape-shifters that take on the forms of females. such characters would confuse toy manufacturers. according to them, girls don’t play with action figures, at least not ones that are based on fighters. and no boy would be caught dead playing with an action figure that looks like a pastel-colored woman with a gemstone on her body.

sure, they could go the she-ra route and make the crystal gems into barbie dolls, but amethyst hardly has what you would call a barbie body, not to mention she’s the only one whose hair you can style.

so what do you think? i speak as a person who grew up in the 90’s, when franchises were put into gendered boxes when it came to merchendising. from what i fathom, society seems to be making leaps and bounds that suggest that people are seeing through the gendering of toys and shows and our attitudes are becoming slightly more relaxed, even if we have yet to get used to these new attitudes. there’s an entire subculture of grown men who like a show about ponies. avatar: the legend of korra had a tough female protagonist (something that nickelodeon thought would be risky) and it proved to be a hit with boys and girls alike. one person on the steven universe subreddit said that she attended an event where a boy decorated his forehead to be like pearl because he admired her. looking back on my own life, i was a girl who was a fan of digimon growing up. i still have my digivolving greymon-to-metalgreymon action figure stored away.

but larger institutions tend to take a while to catch up with social attitudes. so how long will it take before we get action figures of pastel-colored, gem-encrusted women? i don’t know but when they do come out, it will give me hope that the toy companies are finally paying some attention.",18408.0,826.0,0.86,2016-06-09 04:22:34,librarygal22,0.0,0.0,9.0,3357.0,577.0

the concept should be simple enough: a male feels female on the inside or a female feels male on the inside and sometimes they go through the lengths to dress their gender or get sex reassignment surgery. however, i've been taught that sex and gender are different, that gender is a social construct and there is nothing inherently wrong with people with penises wearing dresses or people with vaginas liking superheroes. sure, gender exists on a spectrum, but wouldn't this still  surrender to the societal definition of gender if we define something as ""masculine"" or ""feminine?""

what i'm asking is, how do people who want to move beyond societal ideas of gender define male and female on a spectrum without adhering to those societal definitions or offending anybody? i can't for the life of me figure out how to do this.",18408.0,826.0,0.82,2016-03-06 23:38:01,librarygal22,0.0,0.0,12.0,1283.0,222.0
435uao,my partner [m/21] smokes and i can't stand getting intimate with him.,3.0,9.0,69.0,relationships,"hello. i am [f/26] and i am currently in a relationship with a [m/21]. we've been with each other for the past few months and at this point, we're not girlfriend and boyfriend, more like friends with benefits, although i do make him wear a condom each time. he's a sweet guy who goes out of my way to please me and is quite good at pleasuring a woman.

with that said, he has the habit of smoking, although i don't know how many cigarettes he goes through a day. i have no trouble becoming aroused during foreplay but that man smells *nasty* during intimacy. i don't know how non-smoking women could stand doing it back in the days when smoking was more common/socially acceptable. i can't even look him in the face even though he's decent-looking and i struggle to kiss him even though i know it would enhance our experience. afterward, my mouth tastes weird and my entire room smells of tobacco. thirty-two years ago, my father told my mother that he wouldn't marry her unless she quite smoking, which she did. i figured that he said that because he was concerned about her health and future but now i know that he also did it for his sanity.

the smell and the taste isn't the worst part, though. my partner has what i like to call ""kisses of death."" every time i become intimate with him (which is every couple of weeks or so), i end up coming down with a cold. it's happened three times already and i'm still getting over this one. i consulted google and found pages that say that you can't get the common cold from kissing, which i find hard to believe. i think the reason why i didn't get any colds with my last partner was because i was taking extra magnesium during that time. however, i'm not sure whether or not getting colds is my body reacting to the foreign substance (tobacco and the other crap that is in cigarettes) entering it, although i am no expert in epidemiology. i have heard that first-time smokers tend to get phlegmy, which is what i definitely am (as well as stuffy and drippy)

my partner tells me that he is planning on quitting smoking and taking up vaping (which apparently isn't as bad) but i don't know when he's going to do that. i've made the decision not to even kiss him until he gives up smoking and, considering how difficult that is for people, this might be a long time from now.

3zy509,idea for an su video game,6.0,3.0,25.0,stevenuniverse,"**tl:dr**: my idea about a video game about a card game about gems... based on games i've played when i was younger.


i've been doing some thinking... i know there is a steven universe app game but i feel like the show is ripe to expand to other platforms. how about... steven universe card battle?


when i was a but a wee lass, i played digimon card battle and monster rancher battle card on the original playstation. the games involved using monsters for fighting and each of them had animations that corresponded to the attacks that were being used. with steven universe borrowing themes and ideas from these animes, it would be stupid not to make a card battle game based around gems.*


all the while, i wonder what the card-playing mechanics would be. this is what they were in dcb and mrbc:


in digimon card battle, there are one-on-one battles where you start with the smallest stage (in this case, rookie). the digimon cards not being played in the deck are used as utility cards (i.e. healing). if you don't want to use those cards, you can discard them and ""recycle"" them as dp for digivolving your digimon to a higher stage. each digimon card has a color that corresponds with which element it has (e.g. blue for water, red for fire, yellow for land-based) and it can only digivolve into another digimon with that same color. there were three stages of card: rookie, champion and ultimate, in that order, which means that each digimon being played could digivolve twice. 


i only rented monster rancher battle card a couple of times from the video store but i still remember certain aspects of it. for instance, each game was a three-on-three battle where three monster cards were assigned to each deck with the rest being specifically utility cards.


so how would it work when you're playing a gem-based card game? i think it would work best if it was three-on-three battles like mrcb, that way two of the cards can fuse at one point and, if the battle goes long enough, all three of them could fuse. 


like dcb, you could discard your utility cards and turn them into points for fusing later on. i don't think that an elemental system would work since this would limit the possibilities for fusions. there could be three stages of gem: b (for basic), f1 (for a fusion of two gems) and f2 (for a fusion of three gems). the one problem i see with this system is that, technically speaking, a really powerful gem like yellow diamond would only be a basic card since she's not a fusion.


when i told this idea to my sister, she said that i *had* to post it on the internet somewhere and this is what i'm doing. so what do you guys think?


* i know what you're thinking... why not an actual card game for steven universe instead of a video game based on a card game? well, i don't see very many card games catching on besides magic: the gathering and pokemon. i figure that the next best thing would be to have it as a video game and set it in a universe where the game *has* caught on.

3y3xxo,do gems feel pain?,1.0,18.0,18.0,stevenuniverse,"keep in mind that there are only a few episodes of this series that i have seen more than once. with that said, i don't think they go over this in the series.

it is stated on more than one occasion that gems are being made of light and that in order to do things like eat and give birth, they would have to shape shift the necessary organs into existence beforehand. this gets a little confusing once you notice that gems can produce tears, mucus and saliva on a whim, although i suppose you can chalk that up to shape-shifting as well. 

it makes me wonder whether they have nerve endings. in other words, are they capable of feeling physical pain? the series shows them suffering if they are getting creamed in battle, which would signify that this is the case. however, why would they shape-shift nerve endings into existence if it serves no benefit to their condition? wouldn't it be better if they couldn't feel pain during battle? or are they only pretending in order to seem more ""human?""

3gdzt6,why i consider garnet to be a role model right now,31.0,4.0,50.0,stevenuniverse,"before, i thought that garnet was a good character but she wasn't really my favorite. i didn't think she had much personality besides kicking and punching things. however, i've reached a point in my life now where i'm trying to make changes to my perspective. when i was with my first boyfriend, he clearly liked me a lot more than i liked him and i was only with him because i thought that i wasn't going to find anyone better. i managed to break up with him but not without feeling supremely guilty about it. now, i have recently broken up with my second serious boyfriend. this has pained me because we had been dating for two years and i very much returned his affections. the only reason we broke up was because of the distance between us. during my younger years, i've wanted a boyfriend not just because i wanted to experiment sexually but because i wanted someone there to assure me that i'm beautiful and talented. i wanted someone to complete me.

one wouldn't expect a single person to admire a character that is the physical embodiment of two other characters that are in love but consider this: in the episode ""love letters,"" steven mentions that garnet would not return jamie's feelings because ""she's already in a relationship."" she's in a relationship with herself.

during this time, i am not going to jump from one boyfriend to the next, especially if there is just going to be unnecessary drama involved. i am going to treat myself well. i am going to give myself the love that i never gave myself during my less confident younger years. this means that i've turned down several potential suitors, partly because of the promise i made to myself and partly because i didn't return their feelings. but i try not to let the guilt of their heartbreak get to me because, for once, i am listening to my needs instead of putting their needs first at the expense of mine like i did with my first boyfriend. i am going to relish the life of a single person and be in a relationship with myself, at least for the next six months or so. garnet does this and she is content most of the time. in fact, the song ""stronger than you"" manages to describe her confidence and healthy levels of self-love (not too little, not too much).

3bk0ea,god and goddess and the gender binary,11.0,29.0,37.0,Wicca,"one of the more well-known beliefs of wicca is that there is a god and a goddess that are present in the universe, the divine masculine and feminine respectively. one could argue that things are this way because many animals reproduce when a male and a female intermingle. it is also said that the new year is born after the god and goddess perform the great rite.

however, wicca/neopaganism is also a group of religions that believes that homosexuals and transexuals should not be discriminated against and that all acts of love are also acts of worship. how exactly would the god/goddess binary fit in with this? it seems quite heteronormative, not to mention black and white when it comes to gender in general. i know that the vast majority of us have either one pair of genitals or the other but who says that certain traits of the god can't flow into a female and vice-versa? if i were a gay/trans person i would probably feel left out in a religion like this despite what the basic tenants say.

3bg9ff,i think peridot will be redeemed and here's why...,13.0,16.0,50.0,stevenuniverse,"the fandom has a particular soft spot for peridot but it seems like the crystal gems have a little faith in her as well. when peridot was first introduced in warp tour, the gang overheard the plan of the homeworld gems restarting the kindergarten. pearl asked, ""does she know that restarting the kindergarten will destroy all life on earth?"" at first, you would think, ""that's a stupid question. how would the idea of destroying all life on earth change the mind of an evil gem?"" but then you realize that this is the first time the viewers see her and *probably* the first time the gems see her. my guess is that she was a recent recruit to the gempire's government/army/workers.

here are how my theories go:

1) they've never seen her before and are simply assuming the best in her. this would make sense since they've only known about one dimensional warp (theirs) for many years until steven found the warp that peridot was using.

2) they did know who she was and simply didn't recognize her at first because she changed her look in the many years that they've seen her. if she was anything like the stereotypical nerd, she knows more about technology than she does about social interaction. in order to get over her awkwardness and feel like she belongs somewhere, she joins the gempire's cause.

i would also like to add that, later on, steven says something along the lines of ""if peridot knew she was hurting people in the process, she probably wouldn't do this."" it is especially a mystery why steven would assume the best in her since he didn't know any more about her than the viewers did.

abs63z,the longtime debate.,6.0,22.0,20.0,PS4,"this  may get downvoted to hell, but here it goes. 

i've had my playstation 4 pro since the release of spiderman. up until then, the only consoles i had ever owned were xbox 360's and my xbox one (aside from my gamecube that i still have and play). 99% of my friends have xbox ones, so i never felt the need to have a playstation. then along came spiderman, and i bought the spiderman playstation 4 pro the day of release. 

right off the bat, the single player playstation exclusives blew me away. although my xbox buddies and i have logged more than a year combined on games like pubg,rb6, and gta v, over the past two years, i found myself being drawn to more single player games like the witcher 3, rdr 1 and 2, assassins creed, etc..

after completing spiderman 100% and achieving the platinum, i bought the last of us and horizon zero dawn on sale. the last of us was incredible, and after completing it, i restarted with ng+, and bought the collection of uncharted games, along with infamous second son (just because i saw the commercials long ago, and i originally lived in washington.) 

i have only scratched the surface of the playstation exclusives single player games, and i love it. having both consoles really is that much worth it, and i wish i would have bought a ps4 sooner. my only real issue with the ps4 is that it's home navigation is not that great compared to the xbox one, and the controllers last as long as a hooker in a church. 

i find myself hopping on my ps4 when none of my friends are on xbox, and i plan on only using it for exclusives because of the friend gap and not needing to buy another mic and such, but i am now safe to say, i am pro playstation, and pro xbox. 

happy gaming !

amsuzt,need help figuring this out,1.0,1.0,27.0,leangains,"so here is the thing:

i'm 22 right now. ever since i was about 18, i've been stuck in these get-in/drop-out of gym cycles. what i mean by that is that basically every year i would go hard in the gym for about 4-6 months, get a few gains and then leave it.

basically what would make me leave the gym is: 1) plateaus and 2)bf% issue. that's where my problem is and that is why i'm looking for your help and insights on the subject.

1) plateaus: is it normal to get plateaus about only 4-6 months into training? cause that would always make me lose motivation. and i'm not talking about plateaus in one or two exercises. i'm talking plateaus in 90% of my exercises and generally super slow progress in strength.

i'll never forget how i would always constantly progress from a 92lb all the way to a 155lb (4 x 8 reps) bench press, only to get in a massive disappointing/depressing plateau.

2) bf% issue: i'm a skinny guy. my bf% without training, but at least eating a healthy diet (my regular life) stays at around 10-11%. 

but here's the thing though: my fat is way too disproportionally distributed in my body. what i mean by that is: my body fat percentage may be 11% let's say. but for example, my arms/legs/limbs in general would look like they are 8-9%bf and my gut/stomach area would look like it's 14-15%bf, so my general bodyfat% would balance out at 11%. i'm not kidding, my arms and legs would only have a thin layer of skin, like you could really pinch it and stretch it all you want like there's almost no fat there, whereas my belly area would be filled with a generous amount of fat, like you could grab and fill both hands with it, not enough to look ""fat"" but no what you would expect from a skinny person like me.
the problem with this is: as soon as i start bulking and training to put on muscle mass, inevitably (as we know) i would accumulate a little bit of fat in the process. thing is, as my stomach already has a higher bf% base level, just in a couple months of training i would get this horrible fat belly, which would really turn me off, making me lose motivation and start to second guess going to the gym.

- finally, to put things in context, i've finally matured throughout those years in-and-out of gym. i know that this year i'll work hard for real and stick with it for life. i just haven't started training yet because i'm currently working in another country and will be back only in march. 

so i'm looking for your help in order to avoid these 2 big issues i have when training. what can i do to tackle these problems?

*note: everytime my belly would begin to get fat (around 4 months into training), i would eat less to avoid getting fatter. therefore, i think this could be causing the plateaus (not enough food -> not enough energy to keep increasing the lifts). but i'm not sure about this.

when it was over, the president said he wanted to meet jackie chan. confused, the presidents aides nonetheless did as instructed. jackie chan’s agents were surprised and asked jackie if he’d like to meet the president of the united states.

jackie said yes and a date was set.

“thank you, mr. president,” jackie replied. “though i did that movie long time ago, i remember it well. working with chris tucker was a wonderful experience. i have him to thank for how well our scenes went together. you invite me to america because of this movie?”

“no, jackie,” the president told him as lunch was served. “the reason i invited you is because you’re well known, well liked, and i think you would be an excellent spokesperson for me! from what i saw of your performance, i think you’re the perfect man for my idea.”

a95qoi,"minecraft, the wither, and achievements",1.0,2.0,39.0,gaming,"tl;dr: spawned the wither for achievements, died right as the wither died, no achievement. 

so, this is more of a rant/vent than anything. i’ve been playing minecraft off and on for years. i love exploring and building things. but i’m not hardcore or anything. i don’t know how redstone works, i’ve never been to the end, and only seen the enderdragon in videos. 

i have been on a completion kick and trying to go back and play older games and finish up some achievements on xbox that i haven’t gotten yet because i thought they would be too difficult. some of those i decided to get were on different versions of minecraft. i wanted to focus on the wither. 

now, i had fought the wither with friends on the better together version. it was challenging. but we did it. i had been worried fighting it alone would be even harder. i started on the xbox 360 edition. loaded up a tutorial level (cheating a little, i know) and gathered up diamond armor, enchanted sword, and all the material needed to summon the wither. 

i then just dug into a mountain and started construction. i built a small room and summoned the wither. i did better than i had a right to. got it down to less than half health before it killed me and escaped. i respawned, ran back to where i died, and couldn’t find any of my stuff. no biggie, i ran to another chest and re-equipped a set of armor and a sword. 

as i searched for the wither, i saw it was taking damage from something. it was in the middle of the aquatic update, killing things and blowing stuff up. i don’t know if it was the dolphins or the squids, but the wither was getting attacked. i grabbed a trident and dove into the water. i had a conduit active, so i could breathe. i started trying to attack it from underwater, striking multiple blows. the wither was distracted by the other animals. as it neared death, it turned its focus on me. it launched its missile attack at me as i tried to aquaman it, swimming and launching out of the water to stab him. 

i knew it was going to be close but as it landed a death blow on me, i watched as it disappeared from i guess a dolphin attack, if that’s even possible. when i respawned, i rushed back to the scene. i found my tridents, other items, and the star thing that a wither drops. and sadly, no achievement.

3. you don't have health, you have sync.

4. the cities look like a historical concept of their real life counterparts rather than an oil painting or a cartoon (syndicate seriously looks like a cartoon)

5. best draw distance in the series. you can see the bureau from the top of the hill in damascus.

6. violence feels more down to earth. compare the garnier de naplouse ""break his legs"" scene to francesco de' pazzi stabbing giuliano de' medici. garnier's scene wasn't choreographed. there was no glorification in it. it was shocking to watch rather than ""woah, violance yay""

7. there were no cutscenes. you are playing as desmond/layla experiencing through their eyes. does the animus just somehow know the best camera angles? 

8. the entire game revolves around assassinations and the creed, exactly what it says in the title. there is no monopolising rome, signing declarations with washington. there is no manning ships. assassinations. no bullshit.

they don’t share that info on their profile and it’s usually after we have connected that the wife explains his “bi-ness”. 
but this is beginning to be an issue that troubles us both. 
first time at a resort, as we are going back to their room, they drop the bomb. my response was no thank you, and he complied with no crossing of the swords. good session, one night stand. 
2nd time we meet a great couple and we connect big, and as we head back to their room, i am told by the hot wife that her husband likes to suck dick, but that’s it. sort of like a soft sell to me. 
that event led to less than a great session, since he had problems getting his up.  
we then meet another hot couple who are openly sharing their sex lives, which includes a lot of her being fucked by big dicks while he videotapes and licks her pussy. he said once a guys dick slipped out and into his mouth. . . i am like . . . no thank you please. then she says he likes to dp me, and she mocks him for liking to feel another dick with his dick in her pussy . . . ! argh! i feel like i am being groomed to expect the unexpected when they visit us again. 
another past couple we played with has commented to others about trying to play with other men as well. they are all fun couples, but i have problems. 
i really get off on my wife being pleasured by him and her, but i don’t want my wife to feel like she is not as wanted since the guy wants to play with me too. that really takes my fun away. i want him to do things to her, that will make her cum like crazy, but if he is thinking in the back of his mind about me, then that lessens my enjoyment. 
so what can i do or not do to still enjoy these couples without them feeling like insecure and me not feeling like i am the new meat in town?
my wife is bi- and we love that aspect, but when we find a straight girl we don’t have as much fun. first time maybe, but my wife likes to play with her too, so if she can’t it’s a bit of a downer.

8vl5k0,"wife diagnosed with bpd, and now i fear my daughter is as well",1.0,2.0,62.0,BPD,"i was married 29 years to a wonderful woman that had bpd. it was maddening. all of the many ups and downs, with no logical way of finding our way out of the many potholes our lives crashed into. dozens of marriage counselors didn't work. she left me and then after the divorce, and after i started seeing someone, did she realize her mistake and then she tried a faux suicide. lots of blood but nothing more. oh, she tried to kill me with the butcher knife as well. but time heals those wounds. we are still friends and still go on family vacations together.

which leads me to this post: 

my youngest daughter is a lovely young woman, but she appears to have bpd as well.  she has runaway from home several times. leaving us worrying about her for days, weeks and even months. she finally calmed down and got a good job and was getting her head together and then she got pregnant from her boyfriend who lives in another state. she has been there with him a year ago and left, because she hated living in south carolina. plus, we have a large family here, and she has full support of inlaws and sisters/brothers/aunts/uncles etc. this is where the family is from. the boyfriends family too. 

so my daughter goes ditsy again. everyone from co-workers, to uncles, to cousins, to best friends have begged her not to move away. to live rent free, with free health care, and to get your head together. then after the baby is born, she can figure out what their lives can be. but she admits everyone is telling her to stay put. but she readily admits a compulsion to do just the opposite. she just gets so stubborn and leaves, . . . just like my ex-wife. playing emotional games. a rollercoaster of drama all of the time. 

i'm not going to be with my grandchild when he is growing up. he won't be around uncles, aunts, cousins, or grandparents. i'm very financially comfortable. i've got money to help her, but she refuses, and blames materialism as the world's sin. (again, she seems to want to let the government to pay for it, but not herself, which is stupid, but hey, she thinks with her emotions.)

so your thoughts are appreciated. i have to stand back, because i can't argue anymore. she is doing all of this to spite the family merely to assauage her idiotic view of this world. so much like her mother. 

so share your thoughts, mine are to just pray that sometime she will again get over this drama and come home. i just fear that my grandchild will be kept in south carolina, under the authority of the stoner boyfriend who mows lawns for a living, will be wanting him to stay.

we have our rules about taking one for the team but this time, my wife is vetoing the other wife.

we met this couple and she is a nympho, they are d/l. she just wants to fuck all the time. so we have had them over a couple times and had great sex. she really likes me and he likes her.  he fucks my wife very well. and she has no problems. months pass. how dance card is used, but never filled up. 

we see them at an event again, and of course d is like hey, lets get together again. however, now my wife is like, i don't like ""her"" anymore. i'm like huh? why? she just gives me a ""woman's intuition"" type thing? like huh? i said d has never done anything to her, but she just thinks she is too nympho and too aggressive or whatever. she really doesn't have a specific reason. just no to them. 

 i like the other wife, but not that much.  she is just  fun to fuck.  but the wife now says no to them.

this is not fair and i wanted some help figuring it out.

the reason is that while we are somewhat busy in the lifestyle, we are not having our doors knocked down. so most of our experiences is with couples who have more ""confidence"". we are a bit shy, so when the other couple is really moving along, then we are happy as can be. 

i would not care, if i had a few other women in our other couples circle, that really pushed us to be together. instead, the guys are always all over my wife, but their wives often are more shy, or just not desirable. so now we are back to looking for fresh meat. 

this has really ticked me off. why? because i really love her being in another man's arms and fucking her brains out. but she doesn't seem to get the same thrill as me and that is bothering me. she claims it is just this one woman, but again, she has no reasonable excuse for not liking her. 

so i'm like, i""m not going to do this lifestyle crap anymore, when you have never been asked to ""take one for the team"" but now you are asking me to do just the opposite. to not take one, when i really want too. how is that right or fair.

now he calls to say, that is what he wants to do. set up a surprise gang bang.

he said he'd like to take her to trapeze, but you can't really take video. so i'm asked to video and participate and thats great but my wife always plays together with us. so her job will be a fluffer i suppose. 
but where do we get the other guys?
i thought why not some other couples and then we focus on her for a couple hours, but then again, the other women might get bored, or want to play too, and then would not really be a testosterone driven gang bang, which is what he thinks she wants.

so i'm going through sdc and sls and sending some photos of some of the guys, but again, this may not be the best idea.

so what do i recommend to my mentee?

74igp1,33yr old son with aspergers. needs a job. any suggestions?,17.0,34.0,58.0,aspergers,"my son was adhd before he was born. we had him in professional care since he was 6 til he just would not go back. 

he can be coherent and interesting from time to time, but mostly he is very insecure and uncoordinated. he is a slob, and he can't keep his car or room clean. he has no girlfriend, and has never had one, because he comes across as weird. he doesn't focus on anyone for any length of time and has little social graces. he is polite but thoughtless. he has had problems holding a job. he needs to be supervised constantly, and well, we just can't find anyone that can help.

he has lost his seasonal landscaping job, where he mows lawns for a living. he is just going no where very, very fast. i plan on putting him into another asperger group class again and to have a phd treat him for his depression, but a real job would help him, one that understood his focus issues and his awkwardness.
so your suggestions as to the kinds of jobs i could help him to find, that you believe may be helpful to him would be appreciated. 
ex: he loves to pressure wash the driveway. he gets into a zone and can be calm and collective as he cleans the driveway. he, takes almost 50% more time to do it, and so that has not been something he can do either. he is just slow and unfocused and in need of supervision. so where do i find an employer for that?

i have only a few years left on this earth in which to look after him, and when i'm gone, i fear the only thing he will have is my inheritance, that he would likely lose very soon after my passing. so he needs help and a job is the answer. 

please suggest any ideas you think he might be able to do. i'm asking other asperger people because you seem to understand his perspective.

thanks

one bit of advice that we have learned, let things happen organically. you have to put yourself out there, but let things happen organically. i like to say two glasses of wine is fine, but after that, we get into regrets. we have learned to just be patient and when we did, we had to start beating off the many opportunities with a stick. and trust me, she loves beating off the guys, but when there are so many, we just get numb. 

so again, have any of you created a diary?
how did you keep it private? where did you keep it? online, in a drawer next to the bed, where your kids and find it?

6sav1h,"""the best sex i ever had, was the sex i'm about to get next!""",30.0,7.0,61.0,Swingers,"swinging is an adrenaline rush. experiencing new partners has been unbelievably exciting and draining. one week we are in hedo, fucking and sucking a gorgeous voluptuous brunette on the swim up bar, and the next week we are going on another date, or looking for one. 

we are addicted, but not in a bad way, in that it hasn't negatively affected our regular lives. but still, its hard to think of any other thing to do. when we are on vacation, we look to see if we could do a hook up. when our family goes out of town, and we have the house to ourselves, we have a house party. 

it's just one long series of wonderful experiences, and yet to some degree, there is no finality. we have the best sex of our lives, and yet, its true that we keep wanting more and more and more. it's just hard to keep up sometimes, so when we take a break, its okay, but we then start getting fomo, (fear of missing out) and we are back into dating others again. 

we have a wonderful and romantic sex life, and we love the lifestyle, but it can really keep you running and exhausted if you are not careful. even when we aren't playing, the couples we've ""deflowered"" are calling us up, telling us about their exploits. we are like little school girls, giggling and laughing and talking about our hot wives and how we love the freedom they allow us to have. 

it's like i can never get enough, and yet, i am often satisfied, but always looking forward to the next delightful experience.

we have been in the ls for many on again, off again years. (family gets in the way sometimes) a year ago we returned ""full time"" and have been having a great deal of fun. 
1. hedo was awesome. sixsomes in our room within 45 minutes of arriving. we enjoyed several couples, some 25 years younger. i could go on and on but it was awesome.
2. numerous dates that did not pane out, but many that did. we hooked up with six or seven different couples in the last year alone. hard to remember. 
3. our first orgy house party was a huge hit. six couples and we rocked the house for hours. everyone begged to be invited again, as they all agreed is was the very best. 
4. we have several couples constantly hitting on us and wanting to meet up, but we are still trying to adjust to our regular life, so we have opportunities galore. whodathunkit? 

anyway, now for some time of reflection.

we loved many of the couples, and would have sex with several of them again, and have, and will likely in the future. they are much younger again, then us, but we have apparently handled our age with grace, not to mention my wife is beautiful. so right now we are sitting in the ""cat bird seat"" and have some choices about what we can do. 

our dilemma is this. we love the sex but we really think we need ""friend couples with benefits"". we want to have one or two couple friends. someone to go out to eat on weekdays, go shopping with, and do some vacations together, as normal friends do, but also enjoy the weekend fuck fest.

we don't want to be notches in anyone's bed, per se. even though we have many notches on our bed, we like to think of our sex partners as applicants for future friendships that includes sex. 

your thoughts about what you like or have found to be the best ""lifestyle"" would be great to hear. we have couples that switch wives the entire weekend when we are with them. we have friends that play alone, we have friends that play but then never want to talk about it, ever. 

so what is the evolution to have the ""lifestyle"" high all of the time? what is the perfect ""lifestyle"" situation?

5jdcyl,"good experience saturday night, but not what you may think.",6.0,3.0,59.0,Swingers,"when we travel, we often times will change our status on one of the dating websites. this past saturday as we were traveling, a couple reached out to us and wanted to go out on a date with us. they were about 10 years younger than us, and their pictures were somewhat limited.

one of the reasons that we don't enjoy going on a date with another couple is that sometimes it's very difficult to get the hell out of there as fast as you can. if you know what i mean. so this past weekend we took the advice of another friend who has been swinging for  many years, and told the couple, that we had a rule, that after we have drinks, we leave, period. 

when we have gotten to our cars, we can text each other. it made rejecting them easier, much easier. and they agreed that it was much easier that way for them. 

this means that we can still flirt and have fun and not worry about whether not we were sending the wrong messages. so we engage them right up until the moment where we said goodbye. walk to our cars and then politely told him we didn't feel the chemistry.

we have had about a dozen or so experiences with different couples. our online experiences have given us four dates, two sexual partners, but no repeaters. 

house parties, going to hedo, desire etc., have given us our best return on our time. 

but the best sex that we've had, was organically created with a friend and his new girlfriend. 10 to 15 years younger and they keep coming back for more. we're worried that they might find somebody else but until then we're going to enjoy.

so that one little rule has made it a lot easier to go out on a date and have drinks with another couple but also not to feel so awkward telling them no. because sometimes it is really hard to say no especially when the girl is as hot as can be but the guy looks like   mick jagger. ugh. so taking a required private moment to be told that she says no to mick, keeps me in check. and that aint easy when the girl is hot.

when we were at hedo several months ago, we had been having fun with several couples. we were very popular, and she is a milf. many young men have enjoyed her, and i'm absolutely okay with that, but one time, as i was going back to the room, she wandered back into the mix and i returned to find her sucking another fellow who i had not officially met.

i told her that i was hurt. that this is about us, and although i loved seeing her suck him, i felt like she had ""forgotten"" about me. we talked and talked and agreed that too much alcohol caused the problem.

fast forward to this weekend, when we meet another couple that we have been excited about. she had been talking about him for many weeks and we had hoped to one day possibly meet up with them. well we happen to see them again and a mutually fun place we visit, and during a brief exchange, she runs off with them to take care of something and 20 minutes later she is back.  

i sense something is off. i hate being left alone, but to not know exactly where she went to, bothered me. 

later that evening as we are having sex, she tells me she actually went back to their room and gave the husband a blowjob and that ended quickly when they were interrupted by a neighbor. she really was excited. 

well that hurt me to the core. i dont' mind at all what she did, just the context of doing it without me, when i was available too. 

she again blamed it on the alcohol, and that they had encouraged her, and she had never sucked a black cock before, so it just seemed right.

well, that killed my libido. we are okay now. we are. but it bothered me that she had not figured out that the lifestyle is not about either of us, but about both of us. i could have enjoyed just watching, if she had invited me, but she again just said it sort of happened too fast and she knew i didn't mind her doing it in principle.

we talked and she apologized and cried and said she was ashamed. i reassured her it was not the sex that bothered me, but the fact that i was not included. she promised not to allow this to happen again.

she admitted, had i done it, she would have been very upset and angry. i was not, only hurt. she again reminded me how much she loved me and how she would never do it again. i have had sex offered to me many times, but i say no, unless she says its okay, and really, i don't want private experiences, i want my love to be involved.

i explained that alcohol won't make me suck another man's dick, because that is not who i am, and alcohol should not make her forget our rules because that is not who we are. 

i hope she doesn't forget again, because it really tore at me. i love watching her enjoy sex, but this one presented itself to her and she went for it. 

again, we are fine, but i had to get this off my chest. i love her dearly and we are okay, but this was important to me.

i told her also, had they been fwb, then i might have been okay with that too, but not a new couple. thats a no go in my book.

i sometimes can be a bit forward, and damn it, its hard not to shout from the rooftops, all of the fun me and my lover are having, so i pretty much told him we were life stylers. he grinned and then started getting up his nerve to share with me that his hot, even younger, girlfriend had been talking about her having her first bi-sexual experience. . . ,

well ding ding ding ding ding. the jackpot was hit. 

next thing i know, they are at our home on friday night, naked, in the hot tub, all of us having realties that far exceeded our wildest fantasies. 

the next night, they called back, and ding, ding, ding, ding. 

another 4 hour fucking marathon. 

this was their first, and she was hot and assertive. he was unable to perform both nights. even was on cealis (sic) and he had to just handle it himself, plus my 7 trumped his 4. so he may have been intimidated. i think it was his nerves. it has happened to me as well. 

anyway, with nothing but my big mouth, we had the most amazing sex weekend ever.

4wrrwz,bad experiences? how does it change the game?,5.0,0.0,45.0,Swingers,"we have had some wonderful experiences, but we have had a few that we don't care to repeat.

when we go to a house party, we either like it or we don't. we never have to call them again, so all is good if we don't click. 

when we travel to desire or hedo, we enjoy time with others, and most are wonderful, but again, after that week is over, we never hear from them again. (although some couples have kept in touch)

we have met and played with couples that we never mixed it up with again. they just didn't float our boat, although we did enjoy sex with them.

here is the issue;

we joined a swinger's resort of sorts. lots of swingers and lots of regular people that we see ever few weeks on the weekends mostly. we love the people and the fun. 

however, several have reached out to us to explore the lifestyle with us, and with it, they have shared their list of ""notchs in the bed posts"".  

well we know many of those ""notchs"" and it dawned on us, that we felt like we were the ""new meat,""  and that got us to wondering, what might happen if we meet a couple and our ""experiences"" isn't positive. we will see them most weekends on the dance floor or at the pool. i just don't know how nice it would be to bump into the woman that i fucked the weekend before, but for some reason, the husband was odd. now we are trying to explain why we don't want to meet them again.

so i guess we are wondering if we should focus on meet and greets at local hotel take overs, house parties, or just plain out blind dating it with couples.

your thoughts are welcome. maybe this is being overthought, but still we want to have fun with other couples without the drama and it would be awkward to see them sitting across from us in the pool.

however, we have been hit on by many, many younger couples. mind you we are not kddo (knock down drag out) hard bodies, so that is not the lure. still we have couples that are 32 years old pushing to meet us.

my wife said she thought that was way too young. i agreed, and then reminded her last weekend, she had sex with a solo male who was 36. so she said, maybe we need to get over our hangups. her stud told her he liked older women, so maybe some couples like cool, attractive swinger friends too? heck i don't know. i sure don't want to talk about britney spears newest album, i just want to have wonderful physical sexual fun with another couple, without the jealously and guilt that is so prevelant in our society. 

we just want to have fun! cindy lauper---- a song this 32 year old hard body likley never heard of.

4r9zcl,intrinsic value of house parties vs hotel takeovers vs adult night clubs vs online swing dating vs vacation meetups vs ?,13.0,3.0,120.0,Swingers,"the wife and i have dabbled over the years and we are enjoying the thrill of swinging more than ever before. our experience level is not as high as we would like and are a bit nervous about going places that are new. your advice is appreciate. 

1. vacation meet ups. 
we started on a nude beach in negril jamaica. graduated to hedo ii. loved the sexual freedom. been four times and return again in two weeks. we understand how they occur. 

2. adult sex club 
trapeze in atlanta. went several times, but it was very open and wild and wham bam, thank you ma'am, which can be fun, but a bit too much like an orgy, or exhibitionist/voyeurs. 

3. house parties. 
lots of fun, if you get the right mix and the right place to play. our first began with four brand new, never seen before couples. it was amazing. just few and far between. wish their were more, but our positive experience is anecdotal. 

4. online swingers dating. 
so far we have had a lot of fun, some not so fun. ex: a younger hotter couple were awesome, up until they wouldnt take their cigarettes out of their mouths. and sometimes the guys dick is pretty small. or worse yet, they aren't good at sex. we still use this as a primary means. 

5. hotel takeovers
never been. do people walk about semi nude? are the exits and entrances protected from outsiders? is sex allowed in an open way? indoor swimming pools? 

what say yea? which are the best means to find others in the lifestyle? a one night stand versus friends with benefits?

4nq4h0,"hot swinger date- failed secret ways to communicate, killed my chance for some great young fun.",3.0,7.0,95.0,Swingers,"my wife (55y f) and i (55m) had been traveling and found a couple him (47m) her (38 f).

pictures and profiles are the most important part and although our ages were pretty far off, we were game. 

we began texting and sending photos. he was not particularly handsome, but not bad. 
she was another story. she was just a knock out. he sent semi nude photos and she was really hot. 
again they confirmed they were interested. 

we agree to meet at a local place they recommend. 
the place is a dump, quasi biker bar. they wanted to meet on the outside patio. we agree. 

we get there early and watch as they drive up in a an expensive new car. they get out, clean and combed, but wearing their typical biker style clothes. again, her tight tank top could barely hold her luscious breasts from falling out. 

i was worried she might find us too old, but i was wrong she was willing and raring to go. 

but chemistry is important. thats why you meet. 

they began drinking one beer after another, lighting one cigarette after another. they were loud and boisterous. 

my wife didn't seem to mind, but yet she did. she says she had been sending me signals. (she is supposed to stab my palm with her finger nail to show her disgust, and she claims she did, but i missed it.) then again, my wife had already approved her in the photos we had seen, and she looked like her photos. so i figured she was game. 

finally, they asked us to their place. they wanted to let us know that she squirted, yada yada yada. everything was great and then the wife said no. 

a bit embarrassed, we said sorry. hugged and left. 

we talked about our communication issues, and hope to learn from our mistakes. 

but in the heat of a mating ritual, i believe i may lose my cognitive abilities. so we need a better way to communicate- secretly. 

my wife said she thought from the beginning i would not like her. that she was not  sophisticated etc., so she said she was immediately turned off, since she thought i was. the girl looked and acted like a friend of ours, that gets on my nerves. the thing is, merely because i can only handle some people in measured doses, doesn't mean i am not attracted to her. at least just for sex. 

so had she not gotten confused, she may have given them a fairer chance. 

still, i have to admit, i was disappointed that we let this one get away. 

my hope is more experienced lifestylers will share their techniques. 

what are the best ways to communicate while in public and yet do so privately?

8bvzuy,"people who can not control the surge of emotions while abstaining, here are some things which i personally like to do",9.0,1.0,117.0,NoFap,"firstly, do not try to suppress the emotions, whether good or bad. whether you feel anxious or really low and want to revert back to your old habit, just don't try too hard to not do it. when your streak gets longer, at some point you get insane urges and can not concentrate you can try meditation. just close your eyes and feel that urge grow and eventually it'll go. do not act upon it but do not let it take control. this is practicing to control the beast inside you.

once you learn how to control it and use it to your advantage, use this energy for yourself. fill up the time with productive and enjoyable activities.

another problem i see with guys is that they try to find a way to get rid of these feelings altogether. you can't. this is a very natural thing. find a way to keep calm and don't chain up the beast, train it and take it to combat with you.

6j776s,everyone says what. i'll tell you 'when'.,15.0,9.0,41.0,NoFap,"when you're sitting in front of your laptop getting ready to experience the most overrated pleasure of this world, that is *not* the critical time. that's the time when you've already given up to fantasy world. that's not the time you can withdraw. even if you manage to, it'll come back and lure you into pmoing.


*then when is the critical time?*

well from the experiences i collected during the last year of nofap, i can tell that the smallest of the urge which comes when you're happily trudging forward is the most important time to stop. not to stop moving, but to stop giving a fuck to that goddamn urge. it is like that small kid who will look into your eyes and say ""please buy me that candy"". but don't listen that's a trap. she'll first ask you to open your phone and just take a peek. her voice will be so decisive that you'll try to convince yourself that just a peek won't do anything but trust me, that's the most dangerous part. the smallest urge, the one second peek.

everytime i used to see a hot pic, that was the red alarm. you would say it's just a pic, but my level of addiction was such that i would search for a similar looking pornstar(does this happen to anyone else?).

remember, whatever you learn here, whatever you practice, whether going out, doing push-ups, breathing deeply etc is not for that time when you're about to ejaculate, it is for the smallest of the urges for pmoing.",2778.0,388.0,0.85,2017-06-24 11:54:26,ChipMonk99,0.0,0.0,7.0,1414.0,260.0
5x2djd,game plan for nofap personalised path to glory...,14.0,6.0,49.0,NoFap,"listing tons of relapse triggers, i realised that adopting the nofap lifestyle was really tough. though triggers like youtube and instagram are infamous,the roots of these triggers lie in the counter-productive habits we have cultivated during the bleak phases of our lives. to ensure a proper reboot, we need to work on these habits.

to deal with those habits, we'll have to first identify them. list out your habits and triggers. being a geek, i've planned a game for this journey which i would like to share. though, this has been tried here before, i felt the need of a more personalised setup which didn't focus on the number of days you went porn-free but the activities you've performed during that time. 

certainly, these habits may vary person to person. i'll be using my habits to explain about the method i would experiment on myself for next 6 months. hopefully, you could relate to it and create your very own game plan and use it.

i'll keep the rules really simple.

**rules**

1. i have the habit of surfing the web ideally while i have (important) work lying on the desk incomplete. so i'll get 5 points for every hour i spend off my mobile and laptop, excluding sleeping hours.

2. i hate cold showers but i am aware of the benefits it has. so every morning, a cold shower earns me 5 points. warm water costs 10 points each time.

3. like most of us,i sleep for long (up to 12 hours sometimes) and this is really counter-productive. every time, escaping the bed earlier than usual (8 hours) adds 10 points per 15 minutes to my tally. while oversleeping deducts 20 points per 15 minutes from it. make sure you don't wake up with sleepy red eyes every morning if you follow this. take enough rest.

4. i get angry really quickly at petty things. i'll add 5 points when i resist anger. when i couldn't, the score will read 10 less points.

5. every hour spent in the gym brings me 15 points. every day missed leaves me with 30 less points. (going hard with workout schedule)

6. edging brings a downfall of 100 in the tally and relapsing gives me a *blow* of negative 200 points.

**one day at a time**

i'll keep the record of the total points each day.

daily, weekly or monthly rewards can be set up by yourself. keep in mind the reward should not be a relapse. for example, this week's reward is an ice-cream or whatever you like for a cheat-meal.

also, don't rush after them. this whole game is focused on the betterment of your lifestyle and the long term rewards await you.

**benefits of having your own game**

you're the player, you're the scorer and you're the ref. your game, your rules.

you feel like you're doing something to improve your life.

there will definitely be a change the way your dopamine and reward system will work, that means, you'll be happier completing small tasks and overall a happier life.

design a game of yours and start playing it, religiously. criticism and suggestions, negative or positive, are all welcome.

5sqfat,how i see women after nofap vs. my perspective of them earlier,2.0,3.0,62.0,NoFap,"for me nofap experiences have been eminently thought provoking, lately. we talk so much about physical improvements here in the community, whether it is pied, acne, hair, eyes, balls, dick or anything else. the more captivating benefits of abstaining from pmo are often sidelined.

quitting masturbation and semen retention do provide tons of physical benefits, or *superpowers*, as they say. temperance from porn, the bigger diabolic, provides you the bigger benefits - mental benefits. one of them is admiration of art, for sure.

i've been on nofap for about a year now. however, i have started following it religiously in the past six months.

last night, while surfing instagram, i saw a picture of a woman, endorsing a brand, apparently in her 30s, wearing a dress which didn't reveal much of her body. if i were six months younger, it won't have bothered me much. though this time i looked at the picture for a while and admired the (genuine) smile on her face and in her eyes. the picture was so perfect, the colours blended together, the picture spoke about itself. it was joyful - an ecstatic sight. the purity of the artwork caught me. this was when i thought about how ~~kinky~~ and ~~nasty~~ pictures have always attracted me (i couldn't and won't describe them) and not the real ones. how i have been attracted to those pictures which did nothing but objectify women.

this was indeed the experience which taught me how bad porn, nude pictures and all other shit were. how bad it is to be lustful and ignore the art behind everything. **nofap gave me a new perspective of seeing this.**",2778.0,388.0,1.0,2017-02-08 05:51:49,ChipMonk99,0.0,0.0,12.0,1600.0,276.0
5r97ue,how porn ruins your fantasies and damages your imagination,71.0,21.0,58.0,NoFap,"remember the first time you encountered this ugly evil? probably during your early teens, or maybe earlier.
just try to recollect the memories of that time. were your fantasies the same before porn kicked into your life? certainly, no. you thought about sex, relationships and women (or men), intimacy and love but your perspective of them was not the same. 

when you watch porn, what you see is two complete strangers having sex, really awkward sex. by awkward i mean that there is no love involved. there is no intimacy. there is no touch, making out and not even a single (genuine) smile. there are just two people ~~copulating , a guy choking the girl~~ or some other bullshit.

was this your fantasy during puberty or before watching porn? didn't you think about the buildup? didn't you have that thought, ""oh, how will i make the first move?"" or ""i will make out with that lovely girl"" or even mild thoughts about how were you going to make her laugh at your first date?

before porn, your thoughts were pure. you never thought about doing some ridiculously uncomfortable stuff. you sure wanted to experience sex but not in that way. you were 'healthy' then.

**porn has internally damaged you. it has made you sick. it has decreased your imagination. the only solution to that is stop watching it. adopt the nofap lifestyle.**

now that we know about nofap and as we are well aware about the addiction, let's share our knowledge.


 i have this whole bunch of friends and relatives whom i want to tell about this great place. since i am a teen and almost everybody is into it at this age, i have started *preaching* some friends and cousins.


i have started telling people about my experiences - the relapses, the superpowers, the community, how good i felt, the energy we regain, the anxiety that's cured, how i felt around girls. most of them were blown. some thought it was bullshit(well let's ignore these assholes). some have already started nofap.


some benefits of sharing your problems with them are:

*you can have a real accountability partner. that can be fun. you can treat it like a game.
*you don't have to depend upon the online community too much. though this subreddit is really helpful but lesser the time you spend on internet, fewer are the chances of a relapse.
*you can share your experiences with them. basically whatever you do online here, can be done offline as well. i personally find it more convenient to stay offline to avoid unnecessary triggers and procrastination periods.

i've always had success at dating. i've always been good with girls(infact, most of my friends are girls). so obviously girls are not my motive for nofap.

i've been addicted to porn for almost 4 years. that's not really long tho. btw, i am 17.
coming to the point. yesterday, i went to school after a long time to submit some of my projects. one of my friends accompanied me. we'll call her a. my project was already complete but hers was not finalised. when we reached school, a asked me to help her complete the project. she has been my friend for about an year but we weren't that close. she was the one who approached me and she was the one who asked to exchange numbers. so i was quite sure that a was attracted to me. after the final project submission, we left the school. i went to drop her home. she asked me to join her for lunch. i agreed. then came the moment.. after lunch, when i was about to leave, a said, ""listen, i wanted to say something...... i've always wanted to spend some time with you. it was a nice lunch date.(after smiling for a moment)....i'm really falling for you. i think i love you""

i was overwhelmed. i hugged her tightly. but somehow i controlled myself and replied ""that's really nice. even i like you. but this is my final year and i don't want to ruin anything. let's give it some time. i think you're just desperate after the date."" and i drove away as fast as i could.


now the same eve, i was talking to another friend over skype. let's call her p. we've been friends for 6 years. we are more than friends.
p being a psychology student convinced me to take a quiz about human reactions to hypothetical situations. there was a question at the end of the quiz 'if you were to die in a minute, whom would you talk to and what would've you told them.' i answered ""parents. i would've told them about how much i love them.""

then i asked her the same. p said that she would've proposed me.

she said, ""let's get it clear. we've been friends for a long time. but from the past six months, i've been weirdly attracted towards you. i think i am in love."" 

i chose not to reply her on that. but today, in the morning, she texted me 'i need an answer'.
now this may be really early to write about my personal nofap benefits but here it goes.

**this is what nofap does**

*it gives you the power to control your life. you could say 'no' to people. you could ask them to stay away.

*it makes you mature enough.

*it really makes you attractive. that's because of your confidence. people admire you for that.

**other benefits**

*you have more time and energy to do stuff.

*you see yourself more organised.

*you have a clearer picture of you and your future in mind.

thanks for reading through this. this may seem unrealistic but that's true. you could achieve it too. just be focused. and don't do nofap for girls. no. it's for you. it's for your betterment.",2778.0,388.0,0.62,2017-01-08 09:24:55,ChipMonk99,0.0,0.0,6.0,2899.0,544.0
5l3gpm,nofap - gives you wings!,87.0,22.0,24.0,NoFap,"many people wonder 'how does nofap give you superpowers?'. the clear answer is - it doesn't. it just gives you extra time and unbelievable amount of energy. the energy you used to waste. the power within you, which got thrown away earlier, is now restored. you feel like doing something for yourself. now it's completely upto you to use this energy wisely.
managing this energy is a humongous task in early stages. though after some time, when your brain is clear and all set to reboot, you know what are your priorities and what you need to work on.
don't waste that energy. that's gold. that's something you call manliness. during puberty, you start receiving this energy and when you're unsure about how to use it, you would fap. but fuck it. this time, use this to your benefit. hit the gym, work overtime or study. do whatever you feel like. whatever makes you happy, successful and moreover a man!

things i have tried include unplugging and reseating the drives, ram sticks, power cables ( sorry not really familiar with the lingo), restarting with everything but the power unplugged, testing with another power thing (is that the one called psu?) and basically switching around all the cables since both machines are identical.

yesterday, the older of the pcs started making a weird static noise and the bottom led light comes on after a while but still no blinking, beeps or fan activity.

8by4sw,(gotham) joker's identity and the reason for all the freaks in gotham city.,62.0,19.0,75.0,FanTheories," hi. long post ahead. english isnt my native language, apologies for any errors.

 i just finished watching s04e18 of gotham, obviously spoilers ahead.


immediately after this episode i rewatched the killing joke, the only batman movie to give us the joker's backstory, which was that he was fired from a factory job and started a gig at a night club as a comic. he is newly married and hiding his financial problems from his wife, forcing him to approach two mafioso regulars for a ""job"".

he is told to wear a tuxedo, important for the job (also important to the theory) and then later made to impersonate a villain unbeknownst to him. batman kicks him into a vat leading to a sewage system just outside the aforementioned factory (which i believe to is property of wayne industries) and the origin story ends with him laughing like a maniac and itching in factory run off.


now back to gotham, we have already met three other people transformed by the sewage sytem and river in gotham, i.e. poison ivy, the penguin, fish mooney and solomon grundy. 

it made ivy literally grow like a weed from a teen to a woman in her thirties or forties and made solomon grundy aka butch, a capo with the corleone family, oswald cobblepot and fish mooney come back to life.

in episode 17, when jarvis tech, jerome vileska and jonathan crane ( scarecrow) need to test a poisonous gas, jerome's lunatics bring in a guy in a suit they refer to as just ""a businessman"" who starts laughing maniacally after exposure. 

**tldr 1** my theory is that the budinessman from episode 4.17 is the real joker of the gotham universe. 

in the most recent episode, jerome tells jim gordon that what he is is a philosophy that will present itself in gotham's most discontent. the episode also rules out jerome as the joker and teases us with jeremiah (jerome's twin) but his age (3-5yrs older than bruce wayne) makes no sense.

it would also explain why the show has managed to age poison ivy from 11 years old to a grown ass woman in one season, because ivy was supposed to be older than batman.

the reason for all the freaks is that the scarecrow's gas was made in a wayne industries lab (mentioned in episode 18), meaning we have two culprits. lucius fox, who investigates all the weird shit in gotham lately, alice tech's virus, jarvis tech's victims and scarecrows victims.
  or dr hugo strange. the dude responsible for villains not dying and all the other freaks. he was last seen kidnapped by fish mooney.

**tldr2**  the toxic waste of both dr hugo or lucius fox are directly resposible for the freaks.

 hi, i've never posted to this sub before but discovering it was the highlight of my year. it feels both reassuring and fucked up that there are people going through exactly what i'm going through.

 after 18 months without meds, i started back up on haloperidol 6 days ago and although it sucks, i finally have streamlined thoughts, can watch a whole episode of a sitcom without interruptions and my voices almost never mouth off to me unprompted (yayy). i am saving up for a consultation to get my prescription upgraded.

my main problem right now is that i cant sleep and my mind goes to a very dark emotional place the second i have nothing to watch. i have all the free time in the world and i spend it all on tv shows because i'm never sad when laughing or intrigued by a good story. so, yeah, i need recommendations for shows, games, hobbies to keep me busy this year.

i have zero ambition and zero will to live but failing at suicide multiple times made me give in and just wait for something to happen, in the meantime i have nothing to do and no particular interest in anything or anyone but i would like to change that. maybe a skill that's easy to learn online, a challenging game or binging weeks worth of tv will help. i cannot stress how bored i am and these dark thoughts are getting old, i need to distract myself until maybe a better reason to live comes up.

5nr0jh,(usual suspects) verbal kint accidentally confesses to a murder.,29.0,11.0,64.0,FanTheories,"first off, hi.
secondly, i'm just rewatching this movie and caught something funny, so not really a theory. 

 when verbal (roger,  really) kint is telling the story of what transpired on the boat, he mentions in the statement that he witnessed the last murder (of dean keaton) by a man of slim build in a suit (keyser soze) who shot keaton twice. 
  
 when reminded of this during the interrogation, he asks for a minute (to think). the officer says that he (verbal) had previously indicated that he did not know who the shooter was. 

verbal then abruptly changes the story saying ""i know there was dope on that boat"" after which the officer gets physical with him and asks him to ""stop stalling and tell the truth"" 

the following transpires verbatim (in yells) after the cop (dave kujan) shoves kint to the ground. 

cop: tell me the truth, try to tell me you saw someone kill keaton! 

verbal: (before cop finishes statement) i don't know what you're talking about, i did, i did kill keaton. 

cop: (also interrupting him) you're lying to me 

verbal: i am not ly... i don't know.... 

cop: you knoooww, you've known this whole fucking time 

verbal : i don't know what you're saying, i did see keaton get shot, i swear to you. 


   sorry,  i'm on mobile so i can't link a video but its at the 1:24:26 mark. 

so theory is, i think kint thought the cop had figured it out and when shoved,  and in fear, accidentally confessed. 

he is also not that good at lying and had already messed up once by screaming ""fuck""  after the first time the cop mentions keyser soze. he is a great actor though. 

after the cop questions on why he didn't just shoot soze, he gives an elaborate answer saying, ""how do you shoot the devil in the back... what if you miss..."" and then shows his crippled arm to the police, implying that he wouldn't be a good shot. 
  when the cop buys it you could almost see the relief on his face, much more subtle than when he was actually smirking and stifling laughter before when the cop wasn't looking. 

he does something similar prior to the ""heist"" where he simply can't believe that the other guys from the line up would ""walk in to certain death"" (kint's words) 

i also love that the last words he said to the cop was, ""fucking cops"" as if to further show his disbelief in how well things are going. 

sgt rabin also told the other cop(kujan) , that ""this guy (verbal) is protected from up on high by the prince of darkness himself"" 

anyways, i'd love some feedback.

""56 points in 40 games"". that doesn't sound so bad when you here is like that.

you get the idea. as a comparison, the bruins have played 40 games this season (the same amount we have left), and their very solid 23-10-7 record would not be good enough for us. we would essentially have to finish the season as strongly as tampa bay started theirs.

although it looks great and stylish af (they kinda look like comicbook panels to me), i fear it might grow tiring. 

another concern is how this impacts the designing of the fatalities, imposing this limitation certainly constraints what kind of fatalities they can choreograph. surely not every move can end up in a face closeup, so they kinda have to steer the action towards it.

apparently there is an option to disable this ""feature"" in the service menu, called ""global dimming"".

aam5pm,what causes audio clipping / distortion when the speakers themselves are not the culprits?,1.0,9.0,90.0,hometheater,"when i'm playing multi-channel audio a lot of those high volume sounds in the soundtrack get ""clipped"" and distorted. it is very noticeable when the scene gets active with lots of sounds firing from the lcr and then dialogue has to come in mid-action, the voice is heard clipping noticeably. some sound effects on r & l will also get clipped / distorted audibly.

&#x200b;

the sound doesn't get completely distorted, but it is very easy to distinct sounds that do while listening material, and they are the sounds that stand out in the mix volume wise (swords seething, loud dialogue, screams, etc)

&#x200b;

like most people, i came across clipping & distortion in the past the usual way: playing back really loud on crappy speakers that couldn't handle it. what baffles me is that the volume i tested was not that high, i was reading 70-75db s average, the volume on my amp being a little over the middle in a small-to-med room.

&#x200b;

i am removing the speakers from the equation because they are brand new and perhaps an overkill for my avr.

i am left wondering: 

is there some problem with the wiring? 

is it the avr itself being too weak to power the l c r speakers efficiently? if yes, what happens exactly for the sound to be distorted as i would love to learn, and also what should i be looking at to replace my existing avr? 

is the denon avr-x3500h (currently discounted at 666eur on [amazon.de](https://amazon.de)) a good choice? 

am i missing something else?

i heard of dvd-a and sacd before, but never these.

i did some light searching and all i could find were marketing jargon like:

>unlike conventional cds, ultimate high quality compact discs (uhqcd) are not pressed from polycarbonate, but cast from a photopolymer and cured with uv light.   
the combination results in a significantly reduced reflection of the laser light inside the cd and an unmatched precise edge transition between pits and lands of the cd. musically, there is a sound image reminiscent of analog master tapes. 

now, correct me if i'm wrong, these people are trying to quantify digital audio quality using ""analog"" means. what difference does it make to the audio quality if the laser reflects less or if there are better groove or pit transitions? this ain't vinyl or mag tapes. isn't digital binary? (it either reads or it doesn't). aren't all optical discs mediums to just carry data? what difference does the surface material make? if that same data is stored on a usb drive or a cd or dvda or sacd that file will sound the same played back on the same equipment.

9mrlc1,"problem with ""queuing"" tasks / everyday life",6.0,4.0,44.0,BPD,"hello everyone!

i am asking the below in this sub as i am wondering if other people that have been diagnosed with bpd also share these other symptoms.

when it comes to executing simple tasks, such as tidying up my apartment for example, i start ""imagining"" what i must do to clean it. 

for example i will imagine my self tiding up the living room, pickup up those dirty glasses, getting the trash bag out, etc. while i am trying to ""queue"" my actions, the socks in the bedroom will pop-in my head, then the ashtray and bottles of water in study room, interjecting my thought process at a very fast pace, creating a chaos in my head and a lot of stress. (this will be the main reason i will procrastinate at the beginning)

when i finally get to it, my actions are starting to resemble my thought process, i do a little bit of the living room, its half way done and i divert my attention to the study room, then go back to the living room, before starting work on my bedroom..it feels im working more but not efficiently.

i used cleaning my apartment as an example because it happens and its easier to explain with rooms etc, but this gets far more serious when i am at work. my position demands tending to many concurrent projects, and this exact same thing happens, i start fantasizing on how to go about things, mentally planning it let's say, but i get confused because everything that needs to be done pops up, and then i just start in stress, and do small progress in many things at once but not efficiently, jumping from one to the other. sometimes when i am emotionally peaked because i triggered off something or having a stressful day, ill simply freeze for a bit :/

i find it very difficult to focus and prioritize things. i constantly feel i am in a sort of free-fall when at work.

i don't know if what i am describing is adhd (that term has been attributed to many things in the past few years) but i feel that it has been hindering my work and me for years. it's not the my current work, as i had this issue as long as i can remember.

dae feel like this? is this maybe linked to my diagnosed bpd or is this something entirely different? any advice on how to work on it? ",1379.0,868.0,0.9,2018-10-09 21:15:26,Digit4lSynaps3,0.0,0.0,7.0,2190.0,414.0
9fw5hz,rant on show dialogue & the state of popular home audio,5.0,10.0,55.0,hometheater,"ever since i upgraded my speakers my ear has started to pickup a lot of sound artefacts in dialogue running in films and tv shows. sure i could hear these before, but not at this extend.

sometimes the voices sound very lightly soft-clipped, or to put it otherwise, mildly ""raspy"".

now, having worked on movie sets before, i know that sound recorded on set, or as they call it, ""production sound"", is far from perfect and needs a lot of post production to be salvaged, sometimes the production will resort to dubbing (aka ""looping"") the lines because they can't use whatever was recorded on-set.

there are moments though that a particular piece of content makes one wanna throw the remote at the tv and just call it ""quits"". case in point my experience tonight with **ozark s02 e06**, by far one of the worst if not the worst offender of the above.

the content was stream straight from **netflix** @ 1080p on a 80mbit connection, in ac-3+ im assuming at 640kbps\~1mbps.  there was a silent scene in a single location and you could clearly hear the dialogue switch mixing between close ups / actors talking. one actor sounded natural and well balanced, the other extremely tinny, dirty, raspy, and with a bunch of background noise ...as his lines were finished, you would hear all that background noise fade away and the better recorded, cleaner and more balanced voice of the other actor fade in. this went on and on...

it's frustrating when you consider the money you spend on equipment so a squelched, boosted, compressed to bits, s\*\*\*\*y piece of dialogue enters and exits the mix at will, effectively giving you the middle finger saying ""*f\*\*\*k your speakers m8, that dude from work was right, his logitech 2.1 is just fine for movies*""

then you take a tent-pole, mega blockbuster like **infinity war**, which turned out to be one of the least satisfying, flat sounding blu-ray mixes i've heard: lacking lows, low on volume, almost no use of surrounds and generally flat.

i know the subject of ""streaming"" vs physical media has been debated a million times before, and yes, people will always wanna own physical media (at least for the foreseeable future) but i think we are already witnessing the effects of the proliferation of streaming services. not in absence of physical media, but in the way the technical stuff is being handled.

i fear we are closer to the point where the home release, statistically speaking, has to sound good ""on crappy tv speakers, laptops, tablets or, if we are lucky, a freaking soundbar"". home mixing will go the way music went with the advent of digital consumption: compressed and dirty. great sounding discs will be novelty items of acquired taste, (just like today's audiophile recordings) and we will keep spending our money chasing the deadly combination of placebo & corporate promises that ""things sound better"" while we are being fed crappy audio through expensive speakers.

the speakers are running off a yamaha rx-v481. i set the speaker size to large and defined bass out to both sw & mains and set crossover to 40hz.  my subwoofer is an older, humble yamaha yst-320. after playing with the settings & running a few tests (movie scenes + flac music) i came to realize that i get sufficient and cleaner bass with the sw switched off, using only the mains for bass.  i tried with the sw only producing bass and the results were not as good (very muddy in the lower end, not consistent across range in volume, some frequencies that should be heard are felt instead..which might be the result of shitty placement i guess...)

my questions: 

are my crossover & other settings correct?

am i missing important lfe data by skipping the sub all together? if yes, can my sub model reproduce what is theoretically left behind by the mains?

the problem with ""felt"" vs ""heard"" lows is still present with the mains reproducing bass only too, but at a lesser extend. an example would be the drum kick of a song..instead of hearing that kick, i feel it on my coffee table, but i dont hear that impact, the kick itself sounds ""tinny"".

the rear speakers also receive more attention and the sound generally fills my living room more convincingly. the dolby tracks definately create a more immersive soundstage and channel seperation is better defined.

the differences above are also audible when i download demo material from dolby and dtshd (like dolby trailers etc)

it almost feels as if im listening to two entirely different audio systems / calibrations each time i switch formats.

note: this is not some format war / fanboy rant, i am seriously thinking there must be something wrong with my setup :/

calibration for my space was done using the ypao system supplied with the amp.

i've always tried to tell myself that my vote to leave in 2016 doesn't define me - it's how i feel about brexit *now* (i.e. 100% opposed to it) that matters. but even though i've regretted my extremely awful decision for well over a year, i will always be one of those 17,410,742 people who voted to destroy this nation forever. because there's no second referendum. no chance to change your mind. no way to prove that regret your vote. thanks, theresa may. you vile, delusional bitch. worst prime minister ever along with cameron. i'd rather die than vote tory ever again.

""but write to your mp!"" i keep being told. i did. gareth johnson does give one iota of a fuck. he's a leave means leave tory. he's pro-brexit to the core. there is no hope. we're fucking finished.

i try and make myself feel better about this by reading [this article] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/results_of_the_2016_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum#most_leave_areas) on wikipedia to remind myself of the sheer number of areas that voted leave, but it doesn't help. in anything it just makes me even more depressed knowing that even if i had not been such a fucking retard in 2016, we still would have voted to leave.

and as much as i hate to admit it, this is true: america is now objectively in a better position than us. trump may be a complete shitshow, but he did one very good thing for america - he's destroyed the far-right republican party's reputation for good, and woke up a nation of 320+ million to the severe corruption in american politics. and in 2020, they'll fix their mess and actually come out of it a better nation than before like a phoenix from the ashes.

but the uk? no. there's no light at the end of the tunnel. we're heading into endless darkness. we've destroyed everything we accomplished, ruined our standing in the world forever, and made ourselves look like the most hateful and incredibly stupid first world nation on the planet. brexit *is* our donald trump, but much, much worse.

this was one of my favourite compilation albums during my defener phase. i mostly only liked the first disc (which contains pretty much every great song you can name from motown's golden age; discs 2 and 3 are more soul-oriented and so i didn't like the music on them as much) and i just find it really strange that defeners don't ever include bands like the supremes and the four tops in their ""back when music was good"" lists.

i mean i get that they aren't ""dad rock"" but they're from the same era as the beatles so it's weird that i haven't seen a single defening post on this entire sub ever referencing motown music. even weirder is that most of the music that defeners defen is british, and most defeners are american, and motown is *american* music!

p.s. i also feel like the only former defener who was introduced to a wide variety of 60s compilations that contain a lot of now forgotten 60s hits. this was one of my favourites:

so what more can i do? really, tell me. because i'm out of ideas. i'm in the worst of the three brexit camps. the remainers get to say ""see, we told you so"" over and over and over again. because you voted correctly. the people who voted leave and still support brexit are of course massive idiots motivated mainly by racism and ""we won hardy-har-har"" stupidity. but regretful leave voters? we're under attack by *both other camps*. attacked by remainers for voting leave, attacked by people who are still pro-brexit for worrying too much and giving in to the ""remoaning"". my anti-eu parents constantly tell me to stop complaining about how much brexit is a disaster. a couple of times they made me briefly pro-brexit again but then one headline about how shitty brexit will be and i'm back to reality and back to feeling ashamed. i love my parents but holy fucking shit, why won't they just *wake up* to this mess. they're very anti-trump but pro-brexit. i don't get it. 

it's like i have to re-apologise every single time brexit gets even shittier. yes, i'm going to take the hate for leave voters on this sub to heart because i have to. doing the opposite (i.e. arguing that my vote wasn't bad) makes me look like i don't regret my vote. i fucking do. millions do. we are fucking sorry. i was gullible and didn't know enough about the importance of the eu before voting. i was lead to believe that the eu was much more problematic than it actually is. i want a second referendum to undo this but *of course* the government won't give it to us. and so us regretful leave voters aren't able to make our anti-brexit voices properly heard. we have no representation. the government doesn't give a donkey's dick about regretful leave voters and how we were lied to.

at the very least can you guys please stop lumping every single individual who ticked the leave box in 2016 with trump supporters and other far-right racist fucks? i didn't vote to leave because of ""sovrinty"", i'm not a pub drunk who calls pakistani citizens ""pakis"", i don't fear peaceful muslims and i certainly do not watch any right-wing media, in fact i avoid it like the plague (that fucking ""npc"" face will haunt my dreams, if i see it one more time i swear i'm going to tear my hair out).

i voted leave because i thought it would mean more money for the nhs, more ""control"" (whatever the hell that means) and less terrorism. obviously this was all total bollocks but i was lead to believe that this was true. i am sorry. i don't know how much more shame i'm supposed to feel. i feel as though i'm not allowed to be anti-brexit because i voted for it. like only remain voters have that privilege. i just wish this sub would understand the shame we feel instead of constantly pushing us away. regretful, apologetic brexit voters exist.

look. i'm going to apologise *one more time*, and on behalf of all of britain's regretful leave voters. if this doesn't stop the ""leave voters are all cunts"" thing, then nothing will. here we go. i am really, really, really fucking sorry. i was ignorant and believed so many of the dog shit lies the leave campaign spewed about how the eu was holding us back, and also because of the terrifying november 2015 paris attacks, i gave in to fear. and i've regretted leaving ever since i saw nigel farage in america campaigning for trump in 2016. that was when i knew what i had done was really wrong, and since that day i've been against brexit, moreso every month. this a historic fiasco, a nation-destroying embarrassment and i helped cause it. i don't know how else i can express my shame.

just like trump supporters, they're a bunch of meme-obsessed, bigoted, dipshit manchildren who rely on a never-ending stream of bullshit excuses and double standards to justify why they think that the thing they drool over - in their case, an objectively god-awful, soulless trilogy - is somehow this treasure trove of underrated, misunderstood perfection. you guys are absolutely fucking insufferable and the mental gymnastics you inbred toddlers engage in to defend what is arguably the shoddiest and most incompetently-made mainstream film trilogy in history have become so profoundly ludicrous that i can feel my brain cells begging for the sweet release if death every time i stumble upon the asinine, illogical arguments you constantly spew.

claiming that jar-jar is a ""good"" character because he develops slightly (no, he's not), calling hayden christiansen's performance ""good"" because apparently being a whiny little prick is what anakin should have always been (no, it isn't), thinking that obi-wan, palpatine and mace windu are ""great"" characters because they say funny memes (so you like them because they say stupid shit? wow) believing that the romance is aotc is ""realistic"" (you call that romance?), defending the shitty cgi because it was ""good for the time"" (it wasn't), claiming the hot mess of a story is ""complex"" or ""deep"" because it's so poorly-written and that the prequels have ""great world-building""... just shut the fuck up. you guys are rambling like mental patients when defending this trash (actually, mental patients are way smarter than you) and it's just downright embarrassing when you guys refer to the prequels as these solid-gold classic motion pictures when you bash the fuck out of the sequels, rogue one, solo, and most recently, the star wars: resistance cartoon. like trump supporters, you are just infinitely, sickeningly stupid and extremely toxic.

if you're a massive fan of the prequels to the point of not being able to shut up about them, but then start frothing at the fucking mouth and screaming like a banshee at the very thought of people liking, or even just accepting disney's star wars movies, you are such a filthy, hypocritical baby that i feel that i'm under no obligation to accept your misguided opinion. you are holding onto a trilogy that you know is complete fucking garbage due to a sad combination of pathetic nostalgia, partisan bigotry, and deluded fanaticism. 

hell, just go to almost any star wars video on youtube that's either pro-prequel, anti-sequel, or both, scroll down to the comments and view the liked videos of the commenters. a huge portion of these people are fans of pro-trump and alt-right content (fox news, ben shapiro, pjw, no bullshit, etc.), which honestly makes perfect sense considering the fact that to watch and enjoy that vile bilge, you need to be a massive fucking idiot. and from i've seen online ever since tfa came out, the vast majority of prequel fanboys are exactly this.

now feel free to fill the comment section with the same obnoxiously overused prequel memes to ""prove"" that i'm wrong (and in doing so, proving me right, since, let's face it, this trilogy has been reduced to just a big, stinking pile of meme cancer now). go ahead - ""do it"".",28975.0,16080.0,0.4,2018-11-02 13:02:17,TT454,0.0,0.0,13.0,3477.0,574.0

and now, this movie that i really like despite its flaws, these characters - rey, finn, bb-8, rose, poe, etc. - that i feel like are my friends, and this whole movie series and franchise that has given me *so much* since getting into it in 2015 through tfa... it's being seriously ruined for me, possibly forever. i don't think i'll ever be able to watch tlj again without being constantly reminded of the months of endless, just fucking *endless* venomous bitterness and hatred towards this movie. the film is still under constant attack by alt-right channels simply for existing and countless people are being indoctrinated into believing that the movie and its fans *should* be hated. many in the comments of alt-right tlj rants admit that they haven't even watched the movie. they just join in with the hate because the c*nts who run these channels tell them their fans that they have to if they want to remain loyal. it makes me feel sick knowing that this movie's legacy will be so dark and depressing.

and because there is an enormous overlap between prequel fans and tlj haters (for some reason, it seems as though the more pro-prequel you are, the more anti-sequel you are) i've grown to detest the prequels to such an extreme degree that is making me feel as though the fans have dragged me down to their level. i loathe the prequels with every fiber of my being now simply because the people who like those movies are so extremely anti-tlj. r/prequelmemes may as well be renamed r/wehatethesequels. so i feel like i'm becoming as hateful as they are. and that's making me a worse person because of it.

9onr96,slytherin is the evil house. stop denying it. (long rant/opinion piece),0.0,38.0,71.0,harrypotter,"""harry potter and the half-blood prince"" was on tv recently, and i sat down to watch a little bit of it, knowing that within minutes i'd feel those same negative emotions of retroactive disappointment that occur when experiencing this series in the modern day. it's so, so hard for me to enjoy harry potter these days, for one main reason - the general concept of slytherin house, which in my opinion, is so badly written that it brings down the entire series. as a kid, i never noticed this egregious flaw, but as an adult it couldn't be any more blatant. i'm not going to be hold anything back here. slytherin house, as a concept is *very* poorly written, so poorly that i'm honestly astonished that rowling didn't notice it (unless you count the few minor failed attempts she made at introducing ""nice"" slytherins towards the end of the series).

the excuses fans provide for slytherin's universally negatively characterisation are seriously thin. ""oh, but ambition often leads to evil!"", ""oh, it's just from harry's perspective, harry is just biased!"", ""oh, but wormtail was a gryffindor!"", ""but, but, but snape was good in the end.""

no.

it's just really, really bad writing, and you know it. the harry potter books are acclaimed for sucking us into this boundlessly imaginative world, but this one concept is just ludicrous and i personally can't suspend my disbelief here. we're supposed to accept that slytherin, a house so extremely flawed and absolutely overloaded with cruel and wicked people throughout its history, especially most recently, is to be accepted for what it is and seen as any ordinary house for students learning magic. but how can anyone accept that? slytherins are shown to be either openly racist, heartless torturers and murderers who run a cult of death, or they're just fucking nasty, hateful, bullying children. the slytherin's common room in hogwarts is called the dungeons. the dungeons. a word for a medieval prison of torture and toil. the house symbol is a snake, an animal known for suffocating and fatally poisoning people and swallowing their corpse. throughout the entire series, slytherin is deemed the enemy of the entire school - the other houses all hate slytherin and have no desire to unify with them because they're given no reason to because slytherin openly terrorizes them. nothing is done by the staff about this glaring, serious school issue, and the teacher who runs the house pretty much endorses it. children who are about to start at hogwarts *literally dread being sent there*, because they are told that if you go to slytherin you're in the worst house possible, and they're proven correct because virtually all of the slytherins in the series are anti-heroes at best, and absolutely evil at worst. and yet nothing has been done to get rid of it or at least make sweeping changes to it in order to improve it.

none of this is ""from harry's perspective"", because almost all of them are revealed to be so disgustingly cruel and mean-spirited, throwing around the slur ""mudblood"" like it's nothing, wanting muggle-borns to come to some harm, then supporting professor umbridge, a woman who forces kids to self-harm themselves with a cursed quill during exams, and then, of course, the death eaters, whom they refuse to fight in the final book because they're both *on the same side*. by the end, the house is basically just a bunch of traitors to the entire school, because they've been that way for decades to maybe even centuries, *and nothing was done about it*.

this writing is so head-smackingly flawed that it undermines the general concept of hogwarts as this wonderous magic school as well. hogwarts is already a death trap for children which is bad enough, but having slytherin as a house in the school renders the experience of going there downright miserable for much of the time there, even if you do survive falling from a moving staircase or eaten by a spider. this magic school deemed the greatest in the world, run by the greatest wizard ever and yet in it one of the houses is for a bunch of nasty little racists whose parents are in the equivalent of the kkk. there is absolutely no excuse for this house to have lasted this long if dark wizards being made from it is considered normal, including the darkest ever, and it's even crazier that by the ending chapter, it's still not been removed, and kids are still scared of it. yeah, it's named for one of the founders, but that's not an excuse to retain a house that's basically a threat to all of wizard society (and also, the founder was an evil piece of shit as well).

""but... but... harry tells his son in the future that it's fine to be in slytherin because snape was in it.""

no.

snape was not this poor, misunderstood, sweet old man. he saved the wizarding world in the end but he has a shit-ton of blood on his hands and may have left many students emotionally scarred for life. he's an abusive piece of vile trash, and he's supposed to be the big reason why slytherin is okay? and then some fans say slughorn is the main example of a ""nice"" slytherin - the cowardly old fuck who gave tom riddle the instructions to make horcruxes, become the darkest wizard ever and kill a ton of people, including harry's parents. oh, but surely merlin is proof that slytherin should be accepted! no. it isn't. there is no ""proof"" that slytherin is acceptable because we're given seven books of evidence that it's the blatant opposite.

slytherin is just completely indefensible as a concept in this series. it's a terrible concept to have a house associated with so much darkness, it makes no sense to put kids into it, its existence undermines the concept of hogwarts as a place of magic and fun because any student who is sent there is doomed to be radicalised (and if not, still hated because the house has such a horrible reputation), and the dark connections of the house are *so extreme* that it's a downright lie to act like the other houses have as many flaws. they do not. the other houses having a couple of bad eggs each and slytherin having a handful of mildly acceptable people doesn't make up for everything wrong with it. i thank rowling for giving me a lovely childhood but as an adult, the hp books are pretty much ruined for me by this part of the writing.

every time i say ""it can't get any worse."" it does. every. single. time. here's where we are on the scale of 1 to 10 of trump insanity.

1. trump is a complete joke, making the entire world laugh at america.
2. trump is a national embarrassment, making americans everywhere truly ashamed.
3. trump is a national disgrace, ruining america's reputation.
4. trump is now a full-blown criminal and must be impeached.
5. trump is now completely dangerous to democracy and is constantly committing crimes.
6. trump is now mad with power and his administration is doing everything they can, no matter how blatantly illegal, to destroy democracy forever. **< we are here**
7. trump's administration destroys democracy by purging voters nationwide and rigging the midterms fully in favour of the republican party. trump seizes full power, pardons himself, cancels the 2020 election and fires mueller, resulting in daily protests, walk-outs and strikes. **< this could happen**
8. daily protests turn to daily riots as the u.s. becomes a full-blown dictatorship with little to no chance of going back. attempts to assassinate trump increase.
9. huge middle east-style riots occur resulting in many, many deaths and constant property destruction. attempts to assassinate trump skyrocket.
10. american civil war ii.

so, realisitically, how can bad it can it get? the gop are objectively a heartless criminal enterprise and a danger to not only america but the entire planet, but are they really willing to risk a literal civil war? i know that these people are deeply selfish and corrupt, but there has to be some point where they finally say ""yeah... we've pushed this too far"".

because if they don't realise this and continue down the list... i literally don't know what can be done.

if the u.s. becomes a full-blown dictatorship police state, there won't be any going back without a huge number of deaths - and no other countries will be able to step in to help because that would result in wwiii.

9nk596,my big thread of tapped out opinions!,29.0,42.0,37.0,tappedout,"so i've been playing tapped out for just under two months now. it is among the most addictive games i have ever played and i has given me hours of entertainment and personal satisfaction.

over the course of almost two months, i've formed many different opinions over various aspects of the game, positive, negative and in-between. here they are:

- placing buildings and building up the town is so incredibly satisfying. i've become really attached to my little springfield and have spent so much time editing it and rearranging stuff.
- no matter how much money i spend, it all feels worth it - i buy donuts regularly (although i now avoid the gold scratch-r because it isn't good value; you'd need to win the 20% chance prize of 12 donuts *five times in a row* (a 1.25% chance) to equal the value of a basic £5 60 donut purchase).
- the taskbook is just impossible to completely clear! :( some missions just take forever to complete. they just go on and on and on and on, and the amount of tasks just keeps piling up for me. i can't even get below 30 tasks now.
- the town hall isn't very useful. it tells you what your springfieldians are doing, but doesn't let you see how long everyone has left to complete their individual tasks.
- having to tap through every single name to give jobs to everyone is getting really tiresome as well... i wish there was a way to simply auto-assign everyone 4-hour, 8-hour or 12-hour tasks all at once.
- that graphical glitch that occurs where a random chunk of the map (and occasionally frames of animation) appears in random places and keeps changing is so friggin' creepy and weird. can it be fixed?
- the humour is all over the place and only mildly amusing at best (kind of like most of the 2000s episodes and pretty much all of the 2010s episodes)
- now some more positive stuff: waking up in the morning, turning the game and clicking on all the buildings to get tons of money... soooo satisfying.
- thank heavens for ""eat at fleet-a-pita"", a.k.a. one of the easiest ways to farm tons of money since such a huge percentage of the town can go there! 
- the sheer number of things from the show that are included in the game is astounding to me. before i played tapped out, i never realized just how incredibly imaginative the simpsons is a show. i've always loved it of course, but this game really opened my eyes to the amount of work that went into coming up with the thousands of unique ideas throughout the franchise's history.
- and lastly, i'm also amazed by how much variety there is to this game. sure, a lot of it just tapping on stuff and placing objects but there are so many different tasks and rewards that there's always something to strive and aim for. this is the best app ever invented, and while it has plenty of flaws they are heavily outweighed by the good stuff.",28975.0,16080.0,0.84,2018-10-12 16:10:49,TT454,0.0,0.0,7.0,2828.0,520.0

i'm seeing people say they'll vote third party, because, once again, ""both sides are the same"". i'm seeing people say that they're ""walking away"" from the democrats because they disagreed with the kavanaugh protests. i'm seeing people saying they're not going to bother voting, because they're sick of the system, sick of politics, and don't care about trump anymore. i'm seeing people saying that they'll vote republican just to trigger the libs. they don't actually care about politics or america's future, they just think it'll be funny.

it's 2016 all over again.

seeing so much opposition to trump's dangerously corrupt administration made me think ""gee, americans are fighting back"" and i was inspired and *excited* by this ""blue wave"" thing. but now kavanaugh's in, they're just giving up.

again.

the republicans will be in power for *decades* now. decades, controlling all three branches of government, making every single decision. trump will probably win a second term, and hell, he may even declare himself president for life. and the republicans won't stop him. and then the democrats will be blamed for all of it.

again.

look. i know that extreme political correctness, sjws and hardcore screeching liberals still singing that ""hey hey, ho ho, blah blah blah has got to go"" thing can be really fucking annoying. but for the love of god, why does america have to surrender to the far-right just because of this? why do so many people decide to become centrists, taking no position in the election, deciding not to vote, or protest-voting when this does not do anything to solve the problem of the country having only two major parties?

do you expect the democrats to magically grow balls of steel and fight back? they can't because you aren't bothering to fucking vote for them! they don't have the fucking power to fight back right now. voting for them gives them power. but after november 6th, if too many people stay home, they'll still have next to no power, and america will have gone right back to becoming apathetic and not giving a shit about voting in future elections, because they'll consider voting pointless.

again!

america either wants a three-or-more party state, or a one-party state. a two-party state though? ""both sides are the same, lol, fuck voting!""

contrary to what the title of this rant says, i don't want this to be it. please don't let this be it. this whole political crisis is giving me a fucking headache and i'm not even american. i'm tired. really, really, really, really tired. on november 6th, if the democrats haven't taken back the house, i'll give up on america completely. please don't make me do that.

look at trump's average approval rating, according to rear clear politics. it's 44%. 44 fucking percent. what percentage of the u.s. voted for trump? 46%. after all of this time, after trump's got away with dozens upon dozens upon dozens of scandals that would irrevocably destroy political careers, the number of people in the u.s. that supports trump has only dropped 2%.

that's so fucking terrifying. i can barely understand this reality. trump has made extreme, black-hearted, borderline evil corruption acceptable in the united states and his supporters fucking love it. he has indoctrinated his base and likely voters to a degree so irreversible that no matter what negative news is released about him, it just bounces off him, and them, now. oh, sure, you'll get the occasional ""i regret voting for you"" dipshit who ends up voting republican down the ticket anyway (because they were ""convinced"" by a single fox news clip beforehand, and because they are *that* fucking stupid, they give trump an unlimited number of second chances) but virtually all of trump's base gives so little of a shit about trump's corruption that they now root for him regardless of anything he does, even when he's found to have grossly violated the constitution that they so frequently defend as this perfect, sacred document.

98yail,cmv: dark humour is absolutely shameful.,0.0,48.0,40.0,changemyview,"by ""dark humour"" i specifically mean humour that makes fun of those that are suffering and dying. dark humour is a callous enjoyment of the extreme pain of others. instead of feeling sympathetic towards people whose lives have been destroyed, those that enjoy dark humour, and make sick jokes, feel the complete opposite way - their suffering makes them laugh. it doesn't horrify them, it doesn't make them feel sorrow or pain. they laugh about it like it's nothing. it's the darkest form of shadenfreude.

of course, people have argued against this by saying that they only make these jokes in private, and thus their jokes don't actually affect the victims. this is true, but you are still giving the families affected by tragedy a verbal middle finger out of earshot. they can't hear what you're saying about them, but you're still laughing at their misery. so it isn't as bad, but it's still not a good character trait to enjoy the idea of people dying tragically. i cannot understand how something can laugh at the idea of people being affected by tragedy. it's beyond repugnant to me.

personally, i believe that a love of dark humour makes you look like a cruel, unkind, unpleasant person. it's selfish to laugh at people who are going through absolutely horrific, life-shattering experiences. it's harmful to society, it hurts us and tears us apart. it downplays suffering and desensitizes people into not caring about others or understanding grief.

in fact, i find it odd that these people always get annoyed that people are offended by their dark jokes. like, wasn't that your point? to offend people by saying cruel and offensive things? of course people are going to be shocked. dark humour is designed to shock and disgust. and because of this, it is shameful.

it shouldn't be debatable anymore: the prequels are atrocious. anyone with even the most basic ability to critically assess a movie can see that. the phantom menace is an incomprehensible headache. attack of the clones is one of the worst love stories ever told. and revenge of the sith is a cartoonish farce with the corniest action movie dialogue ever. they are objectively abysmal pieces of cinematic trash, directed by a man who didn't know what the fuck he was doing.

i know *exactly* why the new movies are being bashed so much. it's because they're actually good. they are so, so good and fans simply cannot accept that. they are bitter because they know how gigantically inferior the prequels are in comparison. the acting, special effects, props, camerawork, action, dialogue, characters, costume design, pacing, etc are fucking fantastic in tfa, ro and tlj but because people have fond childhood memories of the crappy prequels and feel like they were given a hard time, they just can't let these blatantly, extremely superior movies take their place on the throne. you prequel-defending modern star wars haters know that, deep down, the prequels are horrible, and hopefully one day you'll finally let those movies go and suddenly realize ""holy shit, rogue one is fucking epic!""",28975.0,16080.0,0.62,2018-07-11 03:30:15,TT454,0.0,0.0,21.0,1710.0,285.0

all of the alien words are just pure randomised nonsense, and that would be tolerable but what makes it 10x worse is the fact that capitalised words have different translations. for example, the korvax word for ""probability"" is ""mavirsakhta"" but when it's capitalised as ""probability"" the translation is ""urzhegodovu"". that makes no sense.

this even extends to the translated names of the races. gek, vy'keen and korvax refer to their own individual races as ""afle"", ""uayinn"", and ""itelis"", respectively. but when you capitalise their english names, they are known as ""hei"", ""turpanq"" and ""bokhodim"". they also each use two names to refer to each other: vy'keen refer to korvax as both ""hetiao"" in lowercase and ""arvaiko"" when capitalised.


and if that isn't bad enough, any english words that are occasionally formatted in all caps are something different, too! for example, the gek word for ""starship"" is ""lefabeig"" in lowercase, ""dibinddel"" when capitalised, and ""limplundi"" when translated from all-caps (i.e. starship). this is just ludicrous.

it's very unlikely that this will have been changed in next, but i'd like to see hello games change it in the future, just to add to the immersion. all they have to do is make it so all of the alien words for each english word aren't different when differently formatted. i don't mind all the translations being inconsistent nonsense, but this is immersion-breakingly inconsistent.",28975.0,16080.0,0.96,2018-07-09 20:36:21,TT454,0.0,0.0,10.0,1455.0,233.0

a6nj7e,aita for telling my best friend to distance herself from her other “best friend?”,4.0,17.0,81.0,AmItheAsshole,"i’ll refer to my best friend as “m” and her other best friend as “v”. 

m and i are extremely close. she’s always there for me when i’m struggling as i’m always there for her. m and i are really similar in personality, we’re both extremely empathetic and selfless because we had similar childhoods where we had to take on a lot of responsibilities at a young age. i really appreciate m and she’s probably the only person in my life i’d consider a real good friend who’d probably still be with me when we’re old grandmas. 

there’s been this problem bugging m for about a year now, and it’s gotten to a point where it started affecting me as well. her other “best friend” v, makes everything really complicated. i don’t even know where to begin because there’s just so much going on with her. for one, v just seems like she uses m. like if her other friends are not there and she’s all alone, she’ll come running to m acting like they’re besties. she treats m like a substitute and it pisses me off. and it’s not just me noticing this or making an assumption that she is using her as a replacement to not look like a loner, but m feels this way as well. she confided in me multiple times telling me how v makes her uncomfortable and how she feels that she’s only using her. 

second of all, what really annoys me, is that v seems to lack basic consideration for other people. v recently moved, so she had to transfer to another school. we’re seniors in high school, so it was our last homecoming and m and i were planning on making the most out of it with just us two going out to eat together and enjoying the time. our school has guest forms to invite students from other schools to our homecoming, and v asked m at the last minute to guest her and eat dinner with her, even though she knew that m and i already had plans together. it was kind of infuriating because they had literally gone to every dance together in the past years and she can’t even let me spend one dance with m? 

you’re probably wondering why we can’t just go all together, but it’s really awkward and uncomfortable. i don’t really know how to explain it, but i keep getting these vibes off of v like she’s jealous of how close m and i have been getting because whenever i’m with m, she’ll start acting overly clingy to m and keeps calling her “my number one best friend” while glancing back at me. 

v also had a pretty fucked up childhood because her dad sexually abused her, and i feel really terrible about that. she struggles with depression and had bad problems with cutting . so when v asks to hang out, m always feels like she can’t say no because she doesn’t want to hurt v’s feelings. i’m also afraid of hurting v’s feelings so i have never said anything of what i feel towards her. i’ve always been really nice to her but i feel bad that i’m being fake in that way when i truly don’t like her at all. 

these days m has been really stressed out not knowing how to deal with v because their friendship is honestly just super toxic. v calls her best friend, but she really doesn’t treat her like one at all. m has been asking me for advice on what to do, and i told her to just start distancing herself from v. but i know that’s gonna be really hard because we’re both scared of hurting v since she’s so sensitive, and we don’t want to make her fall into an even deeper depression. she may not be the best person, but we still care about her. she’s gone through a lot worse things than m and i could ever imagine. but i don’t want m being friends with her just out of pity. aita for telling her to distance herself from v? 

edit: sorry if my explanation is kind of badly written, there is just wayy too much information and backstory and how our personalities are to add all into this without it becoming a whole heaping mess of words. 

i’m in no way forcing anything onto m. all that happened was one day she asked me about what i thought she should do about v because she was so lost on what to do and i told her my opinion that she should just start distancing herself from v. m is making every decision for herself and i respect their space. i’m in no way trying to force myself into this situation, it’s just that m and i are super close and she literally tells me everything and always asks for my advice on stuff.

edit 2: i think it’ll just be a lot easier if i write out all the reasons m told me she doesn’t like being with v

1. she treats her like a substitute (as i explained earlier)
2. she doesn’t consider how tired or busy m is and thinks they can just hang out whenever
3. she always turns the conversation to be about herself when m is talking about a problem she has
4. she tells m that they’re bffs but back when she went to our school she didn’t even talk to m outside of school and the times they did end up hanging out all she would do was use her phone and talk about herself


v pretty much didn’t even treat m like the “best friend” she labeled her as and i hate seeing her treated that way because m deserves so much better with all that she did for her while she was going through everything ",305.0,6276.0,1.0,2018-12-16 10:25:27,starrysheep,0.0,0.0,14.0,5105.0,985.0

also, the area kind of extends into my left ear which i feel as itchiness / clogginess. so it is like my sinus is infected on that side. but i’ve had chronic sinus infections and it’s never felt like a growth or something like it does now.

i’m sure it’s not stuck food bc it’s the same spot every time. also, i only feel it when i’m also sick, getting sick, lack of sleep or something else immune system related.

ahvh95,need some advice,1.0,5.0,16.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"i’m a guitarist / singer, and my genre falls somewhere along the lines of indie rock. my goal is simply to produce good music and make a name for myself.

i’ve written about 5-6 songs that i am confident in releasing. these songs are strictly guitar and vocals. if you’ve ever listened to the “acoustic version” of a song, that’s kind of where i’m at - no production, no drums, just guitar and vocals. 

so my current plan of action is to record a demo of each of these songs using my friends recording equipment, then use them to gain feedback. 

other potential routes i see are:

1) find a temporary drummer to write the drum pieces. (going to need to add drums at some point anyways)
2) take them straight to a producer / studio, and maybe they can help me add the drums and i other production sounds virtually.

in summary, i don’t have any recording experience, so i’m not really sure what typically follows the “acoustic version” stage of song writing. i have a fairly loose budget, but i would like to avoid spending too much until i am ready to do so. but i would also like to avoid spending time in daw as it is not my interest.

afd6aj,my songwriting process,5.0,5.0,22.0,Songwriting,"i have written many songs, played guitar well over a thousand hours, and pretty much mastered the art of writing. now, this doesn’t mean every song i write is a hit, but it means i rarely struggle with any stage of the writing process.

1) write the first verse / intro on guitar. this always starts with the first chord, and can even start with the first string. pluck a string, pluck another string that fits the first string, and eventually you have a cool sounding chord. now do that again for a different chord. of course, the best way to write guitar pieces is lots and lots and lots of practice. but this helps.

2) start forming a voice melody by singing in absolute gibberish, but trying to use real (just random) words when possible. it helps if you do some freestyle rapping to get used to the randomness of spitting words out. eventually, this will help you form cool melodies. also, the brain is quite spontaneous and will (at least for me) spit cool words and phrases out of your mouth. “i don’t even neeed your love right now so baby go go go right now just go go go.” that was just random words that popped into my head. these form lyrics, and though they may not make perfect sense, you can reword them to make sense later. also, you can replace dumb words with better fitting words with the same number of syllables. eventually you will spit out some melodies or lyrics that sound awesome. the important thing is just letting yourself think or say words as they put into your head in a melodic way without holding back. learn how to do this “just learn, you know you need to, but i’m sorry to see you go now. it flows out from the bottom of my soul now. hold out, better days are coming.” like that was pretty stupid but just an example of sentences that popped into my head.

hopefully that makes sense. it might seem overly simplistic, but perhaps it can help some people. overall, just keep practicing. as ed sheeran puts it, you have to keep filtering the bad water out of the drain before the good water starts to flow.

ajngv8,[kh2.5] which boss was the easiest in the game for you and which was the hardest?,6.0,20.0,81.0,KingdomHearts,"i recently beat kh2 for the first time (i'll review it on here, i have a lot to say) and i'm wondering what boss was the easiest for you, and which was the hardest (you can also include the most disappointing boss for you but you don't have to) for me it's:   


easiest: throned xemnas. i could probably fall asleep while fighting him and still win. it's also sorta disappointing since the lead up to the boss is one of the most amazing thing i've seen in any video game ever.  


disappointing: sephiroth. i was told by some including my brother that sephiroth is really really hard. i beat him in a few tries. not even kidding. yes his attacks are deadly, but they're so easy to learn when you've been beaten by him. i hadn't changed my equipment since like the first few hours and i still beat him. for shame.  


hardest: i'm gonna go ahead and include all data organization bosses. do i need to explain? i'm like level 93 and i'm getting desecrated by them. bullshit. if they don't count, roxas. do i need to explain this too? come on, he was added solely to make the world that never was harder.

however, my dad was and still is in denial. this sucks because i feel like i can't do the ""feminine"" things i want to (like painting my nails which i really want to do) without upsetting him. it also doesn't help that despite them accepting me, my mum and brother expect me to be manly which isn't what i want at all.  


i also love my grandparents to death, but my brother said they're old fashioned which means they'd probably not like me wearing painted nails (they don't really like my long hair).

how to actually get it:  


defeat roxas in the world that never was (trust me, this is easier said than done)  


obtain two become one keychain. this increases the chances of becoming anti sora by about %50  


head to olympus colosseum and enter the cerberus cup (make sure you've equipped said keychain to sora)  


activate any form you want. if you get anti sora or actually activate the form, no sweat! just leave the match and your drive bar will replenish.  


when you get final form, congrats you've unlocked it forever!  


now, the best place to grind for it is:  


the world that never was, in ruin and creation's passage just before xemnas. this is the best place to grind for levels and forms and final form is no exception!  


hope everyone enjoys this tip! i also want to make it clear that i've never played the original ps2 version so i have no idea if the keychain is even in the original. also apologise again if this is common knowledge, i am still new to the fandom.",20955.0,5651.0,0.73,2019-01-12 21:45:52,hypermads2003,0.0,0.0,10.0,1209.0,219.0

so on christmas, i got a nice surprise - an amazon fire tv stick! if you don't know what it is, basically it's where you can watch netflix, play games and watch any movies and shows.  


now one of the features of it is that you can have a custom screensaver for when you go idle. i thought it was a cool idea, so i downloaded the amazon photos app because you need it for that.  


i also want to say that my alexa, fire tv and other amazon related stuff are all on a joint account for my entire family (in my house). i'm really the only one that uses it (save for my dad who uses amazon music).  


so anyway, i downloaded it, logged in and it started backing up the files on my phone. ""oh cool,"" i thought, ""i can back up my photos on here."" let it do its thing, forgot about the screensaver thing and went about my business not thinking about it much.  


now, here's the nsfw part  


a couple of hours ago (as i'm writing this) i filmed a video of myself playing with a sex toy i had in my mirror. it was about an 8-minute video and it was pretty hot. i finished, cleaned up and put the toy away. i go on my phone and see that amazon photos is backing up another photo. i take a look and what did i see?  


said photo of myself playing in the mirror.  


i freaked out, went to the app and realised every photo and video is backed up on the cloud. this includes nudes of myself, nudes i've received and nudes i found on gone wild subs.  


i freaked the fuck out and started to hide all that i could find that contained any kind of nudity of myself, i've received or other. including the 8 minute video.  


it freaked me out that my parents could've easily found them... i would've died. i just hope if they do come across some i've missed that my brother can back me up (with saying something like ""everyone takes nudes, especially at his age).  


if that does happen, i'll update you guys.

94ip39,could i get some help finding an ejuice flavor that i purchased 4 to 5 years ago?,4.0,19.0,81.0,electronic_cigarette,"4 to 5 years ago i purchased a green glass vial of ejuice that was by far the best i've ever had.  i have searched for hours trying to locate it online, with absolutely no luck.  it was a black licorice/green apple flavor.  i thought that the companies name was k2, but i can not find anything under that name that is in reference to an ejuice company.  it might have been the name of the flavor.  

does anyone know what i am talking about?  know possibly where i can get it?  i live in utah, so buying it online doesn't seem to be an option, unless you know how i could.  

sadly the shop that sold it went out of business.  thanks!

92kfr9,prediction of the things happening this weekend thanks to sam,51.0,13.0,61.0,exmormon,"i think that at 7 pm tonight, sam sent out to several news networks his plans for this weekend, including a copy of an audio file.  

i think that he told all of the news networks that on sunday morning, after his speech in the shadows of the salt lake city temple at 9am, he would be releasing a disturbing audio recording of one (hopefully more) behind-closed-doors worthiness interview between a child and a mormon bishop.  

i believe after his speech, sam will then post a video via facebook and youtube of the audio of the interview.  

i then think he will announce a massive peaceful protest to begin at 5 pm on sunday, i'm guessing outside of the church office building.  at the protest, the child that had been interviewed in the audio will be present.  there will be many news networks present, since whatever was said in the interview will be incredibly shocking/disturbing to the public.  

all the people present will demand that the church change its policies immediately to protect the children.  

i imagine it being similar to the occupy protests in the past.  

i'm really hoping that it will actually be video (or videos) of an interview, but i don't want to set my expectations too high.

i'm probably entirely wrong.  just my thoughts.  

what do you guys think?

(tl,dr: prediction that sam releases disturbing audio of child's interview with bishop.  public will be outraged and demand policies change in peaceful protest)

6taqji,repost of what i wrote on another account a couple years back,11.0,5.0,61.0,exmormon,"so i decided that i am going to add to the stories to let you all know about what happened to this lost soul.  i went to byu-idaho before my mission, and then took some time to save up some money for my mission.

 at a very young age, either between the ages of 5 or 8 i had some childhood experimentation with a cousin of mine, that is also male, and he was a few months older than me.  i have no idea how he learned all the things that we did, and i didn't really know what we were doing, other than a part of me knew that they were things that we weren't suppose to let anyone know about.  i have no idea how he learned those things, and i have faint memories of doing those type of things with 2 or three other childhood friends at that young age.  i had a really hard time trying to figure out if i was gay or if i had something like aids before i was able to talk to anyone about it at the age of 19.  i thought this whole time that i was going to hell because of it.   

when i was about 12, i remember finding out about other parts of my body, and dealing with some self exploration at a young age.  this one day my father after a time of playing with my ""action figures"" in the bathroom for an extended period.  i came out and my family was watching the church film about chastity and the guy that didn't want to put his lifejacket on in a raft.  after watching it my father asked me if i touched myself if a very harsh tone for a 12 year old that had never been spoken to about it.

 for all i knew i was gay because i like touching male parts even if they were my own.  i yelled at that moment ""i'm not gay!"" to my father and ran crying to my room.before the mission the closest i came to doing anything anti the church was dealing with self pleasure, and i smoked two prime times and tried good ole mary jane twice.  i honestly was so paranoid about smoking prime times that i was hidden behind a fred meyer and took off my shirt.   i also had some experimentation with a friend of mine that was a female, and it was a very innocent view of the female body from my ignorant tbm self at the age of 18. 

 i then spoke to my bishop about everything when i was at byu idaho and was so scared i would be told i was going to hell since no teacher had the balls to confront the subject properly furing all of my years in sunday school and priesthood even though i attended everyday.  i'm from a very small city.  i also spoke to a counselor about all of this at school and figured out that the childhood experimentation and masturbation were normal for members of the church.  so much relief was taken off my shoulders since i felt every time that i passed or blessed the sacrament that i was going to hell because i was so different from the other boys that were doing it as well.  when i figured out i wasn't going to hell, i repented and put in my papers.  

i was sent to a foreign country and up until this point of my life i had never questioned the existance of god.   i had only questioned if the church was true and if joseph smith was a true prophet.  i was running on the testimony of those i loved.  my grandmother that had passed away that i loved more than anything thay was a devout temple worker.  my brother that had crazy experiences in south america on his mission that saved his life.  in the mtc they help you realize that you don't need a testimony yet to serve your mission.  i remember them vividly saying in a large group meeting ""if you came on your mission to get a fancy new car from your parents, is that a bad reason?  no! (at this point he made all of us repeat that loudly together,  we dod it about three times because he said it wasn't loud enough).  

they then read some talks about gaining your testimony by bearing it so that is what i did.  i went my whole miasion teaching the first four principles and ordinances of the gospel.  followed every mission rule other than the minor things like excercising in the morning and only speaking in portuguese with my companion.  (i only served with companions feom the usa my whole mission).

the only kid i baptised there in portugal was a little hellion and i remember thinking i was going to hell for allowing him to enter the waters of baptism because my mission companion, the district leader, was alright with him wearing ear rings at school to fit in with children as ling as he took them out at church and while at home.  i baptised him anyway since it was my second transfer there.  my qhole first transfer my companion and i knocked all day long and never taught a single lesson other than to members for a full 6 weeks.  it was insanely tough.i then resorted to just following preach my gospel, qaited for letters from girls i cared about that never came, and waited to go see the sites every p-day.  near the end of my mission i had a companion that had told me he had heard from his cousin that if you ingest a ton of nutmeg all at once it might make you feel a little wierd.   i expected wierd from a helium balloon or from smoking a cigarette.  

since we were already making apple crisp we decided to do it.  we both ingested two tablespoons and nothing happened.  we both went to sleep.

then my life changed.

i had never hallucinated in my life up until that point so when i woke up hallucinating, i thought i had died and that i had broken and time and had entered eternal torment.  at this point i became a wavelength in time, and i remember it very vividly.  i questioned the possibility of there being a god for the first time in my life, and if joseph smith really saw what he did.  finally after what felt like an eternity (part of me feels like it never ended, even though it did)  i began talking to my companion.  same thing was happening to him.  i thought i was dying and we gave each other blessings while hallucinating.  haha.  i then felt horrible for the next couple of days and could not hear properly for a while.  finally i was back to normal.  

left my mission honorably.  went back to byu idaho.  met someone i loved and thought i was going to marry.  my bishop was some evil man that had been a bishop for too long.  i first went to him to speak about my internal conflict. he told me to repent for my ""arousing my faculties"" and pushed under the table the fact that a recently returned missionary just told him he had a hard time believing that jesus was his savior.things ended with the girlfriend.  stopped believing in the church.  had no purpose and started partying it up because it felt like the only thing that gave my life meaning.  

within the next three months i started to explore my sexuality, and was exchanging non intercourse sexual pleasure with a few different girls and women that i had met.  i went to a ladies house that i had met a few times, and we ended up doing the usual things.  after that i was on her bed, had just smoked some weed so i was way high, and she told me to put on a condom.  i didn't want to and i had told her that she knew that i wanted to wait until marriage.  i was naked though, and the next thing i know i am not a virgin as i am lying there on her bed.  i became insanely depressed because i didn't want to lose my virginity, and i was very explicit about that want when i was speaking with her about it.  

i then became obsessed with sex.  anything to numb the pain.  anything to take my mind off the fact that i wasn't a virgin anymore and i became obsessed with it.  over a few months that obsession died down, and i was finally able to talk to friends, that weren't just proud of me for what i had done, but actually understood that mentally i felt like i had been raped and no one would believe me when i said that i didn't want what happened.   one day after being high and smoking a little too much i hallucinated and had what i thought was another near death experience.  while i was high i fell asleep, woke up, and my friends told me we got into a car accident, died and went to heaven, then came back because they didn't want us.  i thought i was dead for three hours or more thanks to them (i cleared a 3 foot zong that was insanely milky in one hit with insanely high quality herb).  i ended up at my ex's house at the time and thought i would live with her in her room for eternity.  this was my mansion in the telestial kingdom.  i then came out of it but thought it was a wake up call from the mormon god.  

missionaries came out of nowhere the next morning and i became insanely mormon for about three months.  i entered a part of my life where i felt every conversation i was having was from on high, and that i was being ""enlightened"" and feeling tbe holy ghost for the first time in my life.  i would speak about tbe church and everyone would listen.  i wanted to become a seminafy teacher i was obsessed.  one day i was reading in the book of jacob and i read the line about looking past the mark.  i then thought about everything that had happened to me.  i thought that possibly god was speaking to me in the way that i was willing to listen and i decided that if there is a god that he would love all of his children and he would direct them all towards the truth.  whatever religion they were in. 

 my family was way confused and did not approve that i wasn't going to church anymore and so i started to distance myself from them and tried to find those that were like minded even though it was pretty difficult.  i started to smoke weed again, and started to drink.  started to do the things that i would have chosen to do had it not been for the invisible man in the sky directed by thomas s monson telling me what i couldn't and could do.  because of all the paranoia that i had in the church whenever i would get high i would second guess everything and my mind would pretty much put me through hell.  everytime. 

my friends didn't understand what i was going through and everytime i would try to explain what i had been dealing with they could only understand compared to what they had been dealing with in their own live.around this same time i was trying to strengthen my testimony because it rocked my world when i didn't believe anymore.  i ended up reading some faith promoting article online at the church.  read the first comment.  strengthened my testimony.  read the second comment.  testimony gone. 

thank you whoever that was for informing me about the book of abraham.  my world crashed.  i knew nothing about life anymore at this moment.    my family somehow figured out that i was smoking again, and thought pretty much that i was getting into crack and heroin, because clearly weed is a gateway drug.  my mother told me that she was going to send me a book that had a lot of answers in it, and when i opened up the box and saw a book named ""understanding homosexuality from an lds perspective"" i began to understand that this was the reason in my families mind as to why i left the church.  later they also sent me a book about shame, both of which i never delved inside of.  

since i supposedly had a drug problem my family wanted me to go to rehab.  i approved of this because they thought i had a problem and my insurance would pay for the 20,000 dollar, month long program.  i definitely didn't need to be there but the center kept me there for 35 days to milk my insurance for all the money that they could get.  i then moved into a sober living home because i wasn't able to live on my own and had to be dependent until i found a job of my parents.  ended up getting a sales job since i have a lot of experience in that thanks to some years of door to door sales.  that company went under after i saved up some money and ended up in utah.  now i am here, and i was dealing with a lot of problems, because immersed in a religion that had brought so much grief and heartache to me my whole life.  

i then dealt with the teetering back and forth from thinking the church could possibly be true, but knowing it was a lie, but not being able to get rid of the emotional aspect of everything.  i would go to church, and i would feel good because i was there, but none of it ever had to do with what they were talking about.  my body was programed to feel good while i was there, it was the right thing to do.  the self inflicted shame was taken away for these brief moments.  finally i found this site and was able to understand a few things that i had never ran into.  mainly because any time that i was able to run into anything about the church that was ""anti""  i would instantly feel bad. 

now i am starting to be able to get a grasp on the church being a ridiculous cult, and these are things that i need to continually reaffirm to myself so that i can reprogram my poor mind.  ""i am a child of god and he has sent me here""  sung for 23 years.  now i need to learn the new ""songs"" and the new things to fill my mind.  so sorry for this being so long.  i could probably have written this into a novel, but i think this would suffice you all to as to why i am here. 

to me this is therapy.  this is understanding.  i thank you all.

aayjbr,abbachio's stand is a perfect example of them being a reflection of the soul,58.0,13.0,76.0,StardustCrusaders,"as i interpret it, stands are the representation of the core of its user. oftentimes, maybe moreso starting in part 4 and onwards, stand powers are indicative of the user's desires or personality as well. and to me, abbachio's story, personality, and desires are the best example of this. i'll explain after i give a little background to how i think of stands. i hope you

starting in part 4 stands are no longer named after tarot cards and display more synergy with that of the user. i'll state some examples that show what i mean. first of all we have josuke, whose stand has a power to heal others due to his kind nature, and obviously yoshikage kira's stand dusts any evidence of the people he kills. these are pretty obvious ones. this doesn't solely encapsulate the main characters but even minor characters like superfly and janken boy. but then we get into stand

stands, to me, also reflect what's on the inside. if the user is in tune with who they are internally as they are externally, then the stands ""acts"" like its user's external personality. note a lot of the ""silent"" stands. then we get into the ""spoken"" stands. a stand out for me would be koichi and his stand, echoes. he survives the stand arrow with help from josuke. i think it's safe to say that without josuke, koichi would have died. he didn't have that ""fighting spirit"" that other stand users have in order to manifest one, which is why i think echoes started out as an egg. it was his latent potential given another chance by josuke. as his story progresses we see that he develops more as a user and a character alongside the evolution of his stand. each time his stand ""evolves"" it is during a time where koichi changes fundamentally as a character, with each evolution marking his growing courage and strong will. his fully evolved act 3 being the type of stand we all associate with stands in general, a humanoid one. as we look at act 3 we can see that it's bold and brash whereas koichi doesn't \*seem\* that way. but i would go to say that that is how koichi is on the inside, and the expressiveness of the stand is just koichi's inner thoughts. stands are the unconscious. and his powers of sound or the powers that sound can create are very much related to koichi's

finally, we get to what i wanted to talk about, abbachio and moody blues. let's recap that moody blues has a seemingly limitless potential of rewinding his stand to replay old memories. this power alone is creative in itself but relays a large part of who abbachio is as a person. he's depressed. he has major depressive disorder, and the only way he can live is through following a figure in power, bruno. now what does rewinding have to do with replay/rewind? as someone with depression as well as access to the internet, i can very much safely say that depressed people have a lot of difficulty moving on. moving on and repetitive thoughts. those thoughts can be a replaying of the same memories, be they happy or sad, over and over as we mull over times long gone or that of repetitive thinking, such as his praising of bruno or his own self-hatred constantly interjecting itself in his inner monologues. his power is the manifestation of his guilt and of him wanting to either change the past, or to constantly remind himself of it. just a reminder that his backstory of when he was an officer is a large part of who his is in part 5 as we see him. his obsessive nature towards ""the mission"" along with his reckless abandon with himself also pointing towards a sort of self-harm or yearning for death. he has a large amount of guilt and the memories of his mistake

8iufxo,i found a book in my attic called what makes lives by porter sargent 1940 edition. there is a section titled perils of the home which seems to imply the mood of the time was rage and hostility.

my friends and i were walking to the buses after classes at uni and it happened to snow, recently. it was perfect snow fight weather, and one of my friends decides to get a huge chunk of snow and dumps it on me. a huge snow ball fight ensues between all of us and everyone who was passing by us had such big smiles on there face. it felt like we were kids again. and someone even joined in. it was really nice to feel like a kid again and people weren’t judging us for having some fun.

litepay isn’t some new technology or a groundbreaking development, we have to stop acting as if it is the reinvented wheel. and we have to stop pretending that we know what we’re doing! no one person or graph will show us, and if we keep pretending (and most importantly promoting) litecoin as a viable payment method (rather than a voltaire and unpredictable stock, because let’s face it people don’t give a fuck about the tech or new currency) then we will keep bringing in more and more newcomers who don’t know shit. these people will then pump a bunch of usd into it, and when it starts to

 i really dont belong in here and i dont understand anymore why people don't let me go. in my opinion is more selfish to expect that someone stays in this world just because of someone elses experience of this world. i think i'm doing a favour to people close to me so they dont have to see me more sad every year and maybe doing crimes etc. and i already have to lie so i don't make my friends worry. i cannot say anymore that i think suicide every day. even my shrink thinks i'm kind of cured and tells me how joyful i am. actually i lie, cause nobody seems to believe or understand that it can last for whole life. if i try to tell sth, my shrink just says the same things and tells me how bright patient i am and how ""good i'm going"" and should go the same track. 15 years they

edit: thank you everyone for the comments and support! i was able to get my hands on a mask and i'm feeling much better. i didn't expect this post to get so much attention, i really appreciate all

it didn't really hit me until i sat alone in my own room, contemplating about life. that question pops up in my mind a lot recently. i want something as calming as death, yet i don't wanna die. i want to be stationary, to be still. not having to choose between yes or no. but by staying silent, doesn't it also mean no? i hate being alone, yet i also hate being loved by people. both bring both despair and happiness, it's a cycle. i hate the responsibility of living up to people's expectations. are we just statistic? we all think we are all unique while billions of people thinking the same way. this world is already so fucked up. people wishing the dead of each others through the radio. society manipulating people, labeling what's good and what's bad.  we have been living a monotonous life. this world is full of pain and sufferings, yet we turn a blind eye on these things. we try to keep our eyes to the front like a horse, and when we have a moment of enlightenment, people think we are just being depressed.

it didn't really hit me until i sat alone in my own room, contemplating about life. that question pops up in my mind a lot recently. i want something as calming as death, yet i don't wanna die. i want to be stationary, to be still. not having to choose between yes or no. but by staying silent, doesn't it also mean no? i hate being alone, yet i also hate being loved by people. both bring both despair and happiness, it's a cycle. i hate the responsibility of living up to people's expectations. are we just statistic? we all think we are all unique while billions of people thinking the same way. this world is already so fucked up. people wishing the dead of each others through the radio. society manipulating people, labeling what's good and what's bad. we have been living a monotonous life. this world is full of pain and sufferings, yet we turn a blind eye on these things. we try to keep our eyes to the front like a horse, and when we have a moment of enlightenment, people think we

now i'm not a big fan of japanese songs myself but this song's lyrics are super deep. this one hit me the hardest though."" **i couldn’t care a bit if i died, but i’m wanted alive by the people around me. living on carrying such contradictions... i think i’ll get yelled at**"". and i was like, i've been kind of selfish. i'm not in his position. i don't fully know what is he going through, how painful the pain he endures every day. that's where i made peace i guess. i finally stopped trying to stop him cause he sounded as if there's nothing else life could offer for him. i won't stop trying

during my middle school days i would think of suicide a lot as a coping mechanism for when ever i was depressed, but now i just don't get the same feeling. i feel absolutely empty when i get depressed now, and end up just powering through it. additionally with the less sleep and longer study periods in college, i seem to be getting them more often. i aspire to be an investment banker which requires

p.s: i'm here because i can't talk about this with my family, they're loving people and all but with a different mindset. they came from the cliche story of poor immigrant to rich ivy league graduate.(including relatives.)",1.0,11.0,0.88,2018-11-15 21:05:41,dan124756347,0.0,0.0,7.0,1031.0,184.0
9wlvd1,depressed serving ns,54.0,21.0,20.0,singapore,"i was very good at school. once i represented my country at a international science olympiad. i'm at uni now. i've been depressed for quite sometime now and am brain-fogged.  i'm lonely all the time and i end up spiralling. i've gotten very bad at academics. to the point of almost failing courses. i get panic attacks before tests. others who used to perform worse than me are doing very well in life. and added to this, i don't really know for sure if i'm depressed or if it's just my lazy ass sleeping all day. i don't attend classes. i avoid people and have zero self-confidence. all this is because i value my intelligence so much. rn, i have no clue what i'm doing with my life. i don't have an interest towards anything. is my cognitive decline due to depression? or are they related? will this stay forever? i feel totally helpless. what do i do? i have zero hope for the future now.

for me to consider someone as a friend. however, once i do consider someone a friend (and it’s usually one person at a time, as you’ll see) i have this strong desire to be the only person in that one particular friend’s life. no exceptions except for family members. i’m not abusive, i don’t force or intentionally manipulate people to stop talking to all their previous friends, i just get extremely jealous of anyone else that they’re talking to or hanging out with. i didn’t have a lot of friends growing up, and my parents weren’t the most attentive, so i would often retreat into a fantasy world. once someone from the outside world, so to speak, invades my fantasies, i become very attached to them. i won’t go into details, but they basically become my world from then on out. my mood depends

i’ve lost many close friends because of this. i want to stop, but to stop is to stop caring about friendship, and to devalue it in my mind. i can’t simply do it. friends, and people in general, have always mystified me. how do i keep people around? what does this person think of me? what can i do keep this person forever? these are all things that swim in my head constantly, pretty much driving me insane. the thoughts and worries get so overwhelming that i self harm. just a disclaimer: i take full responsibility for this. it’s not anyones’ fault but my own. this, in addition to other things,

does it ever get any better? i haven't had a normal night of sleep since that all happened, i don't even want to leave my house. i just want to sit in the dark, alone, and never see another person again. i can't afford a therapist, i can barely afford my rent and the up coming child support i know they are going to hit me with. i know life isn't suppose to be fair, and i know that shit happens, but i don't think i'm ever going to be ok again. i have a few days here and there where i wake up and i'm actually ok, but its only for a few hours and very random. i don't want to continue to suffer, i want to be able to live a normal life again, but even writing this post feels pointless.......",0.0,1.0,1.0,2018-11-16 22:31:49,mylifeishell2711,0.0,0.0,6.0,1909.0,374.0

i've helped myself.  i swear, i hate self pity.  i hate to let people see my weakness, so most people think that i'm this calm cool dude that has everything figured out.  but im a fucking empty shell.  i can't even be myself.  i feel like my mind, my thoughts, they're all frozen and foggy and i'm barely here because of my deep depression and anxiety.  i've search and done so much to fix my issues.  i've done everything.  and here i am, still feeling lonely, can't even start a fucking relationship with someone and be normal enough to keep it.  i just want to be fucking normal.  i want to be that guy who lives in a dump, who can barely keep a job, who is out of shape, who doesn't give a fuck about hobbies, who has a wife and 5 kids and is happy in spite of it all, who laughs and smiles and finds joy at least once every day.  who his kids look up to him in spite of it all, who his wife depend on him and loves him even when he isn't making enough money, and probably plays too much video games, but it's okay because he brings that spark into her life and they're connected like one.  his wife loves him for who he is.

but maybe it's not my fault. i've been through a lot in life, i'm now 27 and i've expierenced a lot of dramatic events. my (wonderful) mother has been an alcoholic for years and it caused many shocking problems, my father has been very sick when i was 10-12 years old and he was always in the hospital and almost dying, but eventually survived, and i've been bullied in school as a child as well as in my own street, because i'm german (and apparently in the netherlands that was somethings shameful in the 90s, although now it seems that that has changed) and i'm also gay, which i kept secret for many many years until i came out to most of my friends and family recently. also my best friend died from brain cancer in 2010, and later another best friend commited suicide in 2015. and then i didn't even mention all the love romance dramas i've been through during high school and the past years as well...
