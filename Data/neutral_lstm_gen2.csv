adpilo,mother maple,39.0,4.0,12.0,nosleep,"mother maple has been around me for as long as i can remember.

my mom told me that no one else can see her besides her and me. mother maple couldn't talk and was going to be like another parent i guess. it was just me and my mom. my dad was never in the picture. 

mother maple was there when i slept, when i had birthday parties, when i had baseball games, when i graduated from lsu, when i got my dream job as an accountant, and even when i got married.

with age i realized not to show her too much attention so kids wouldn't think i was weird. i never even told my wife that maple sat on the front pew at our wedding.

she had such smooth brown skin, gray hair, a very kind smile. she usually wore a red plaid dress and a white apron with a few stains.

she may have never talked but the way she would look at me knew if i was doing good. like, the time in middle school me and my friends looked at a playboy magazine. she gave me a very disgusted look at night when i laid down.

i often questioned if mother maple would be in my children's life. obviously they would bring it up to their mom. me and mom would talk about her often. she was around my mom as a girl too. once she had me, mother maple was with me more. even though my mom could still see her. sadly, my wife can't have kids. and adoption was too expensive

she was there when my mom died. i never thought my moms death would be because a bullet went through her skull. 

i guess between the stress of all this i started drinking heavily. i lost my job. they found out i was mixing coffee and whiskey. i didn't really get that drunk at work which is weird

i told my wife about her. my wife must have thought i was crazy. it does sound weird that a woman follows me around. being there when i was taking exams in class, when i was hiking, when we were on our honeymoon, and even when i got fired. my wife suggested i quit drinking. she was gonna go stay the weekend with her family while i sorted through my problems. which isn't healthy for a marriage but i understood.

i shouted out to mother maple that i hated her. i wanted her to leave. 

around the time i finished jugging a fifth of some really cheap tequila. i started to smell something rotten. it smelled like raw meat that has sat in the sun. i look up and it's mother maple.

she was usually ten feet away from me at most. but now she was three feet away. she was naked this time. her ole southern belle dress was gone. she was the smell i noticed. her beautiful eyes didn't have the brown in them that used to be there. only white. what's worse is blood is pouring down them.  she follows every step i take. i even tried running and she runs too.

my wife doesn't smell anything and she doesn't see anything. she's even stepped in the blood puddles. she decided to move out.

i don't know if i hurt maple. or what i can do to fix it. i've apologized a dozen times. but i'm sorry mother maple.

i have a feeling this had something to do with my mom's suicide.

ax6fi3,who else went through a phase of trying to restart their life many times as a young adult due to their nparent putting them down?,53.0,6.0,129.0,raisedbynarcissists,"for me this happened so many times. 

&#x200b;

i remember once working 60 - 80 hours a week and was going to buy a unit in a developing state near me. 

&#x200b;

my nparents put me down for it so the $15 - 20k i had i gambled it instead.

&#x200b;

then this loop would happen again and again. until last years final suicide attempt where i overdosed in a hotel after swallowing 4 grams of cocaine and gambling 60 - 80k which i stole off them as they stole my life from me. 

&#x200b;

why did i ever let it go so far is beyond me however that is the intense pain i felt over and over again. it left me as an addict with no one wanting to help me. yelling abuse seemed to be the go to option. then i had the mental health practitioners fail me too. oh and the antidepressants - poison on a stick :( it robbed me of emotions to process anything which is why i was so fucken stuck the last 8 years.

&#x200b;

i have so much pain at the moment but am re-teaching myself to use it for the positive and to empower me as opposed to letting it bring me down which is what i did in the past. so far so good.",3032.0,23799.0,0.99,2019-03-04 14:09:21,Mayor-Proctor,0.0,0.0,25.0,1102.0,224.0,134,0,0.14932127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022624435,0.0,0.049773755999999995,0.0,0.054298643,0.0,0.0,0.022624435,0.009049774,0.040723983,0.08144797,0.04524887,0.004524887,0.013574661000000002,0.0,0.06787331,0.0,0.06787331,0.036199097,0.0,0.013574661000000002,0.009049774,0.06787331,0.018099548,0.095022626,0.009049774,0.013574661000000002,0.009049774,0.05882353,0.0,0.013574661000000002,0.0,0.0,0.013574661000000002,0.07239819,0.054298643,0.0,0.5927602,0.03167421,0.004524887,0.0,0.11312217,0.009049774,0.004524887,0.013574661000000002,0.03167421,0.06787331,0.004524887,0.0,0.013574661000000002,0.022624435,0.004524887,0.03167421,0.004524887,0.004524887,0.036199097,0.018099548,0.009049774,0.036199097,0.12217194599999999,0.14479639,0.19004525,0.009049774,0.18552037,0.0,0.018099548,0.004524887,0.004524887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013574661000000002,0.07692308,0.0,0.013574661000000002,0.009049774,0.08597285,0.15384616,0.0,0.018099548,0.0,0
9fw4f2,"i want an intimate ""expensive"" wedding, he wants a massive ""cheap"" wedding. how do we choose?",17.0,28.0,93.0,weddingplanning,"we are in the beginning stages of planning and are getting a little overwhelmed at the cost of everything. 

i have a huge family and he has a whole pile of people who may as well be family. all in all, if we were to invite all of them, it would be 204 people. these are people who grew with us and raised us.

if we were to go with just our immediate families and our very closest friends, it would be 40 people (did i mention i have a big family?)

anyways, my guy and i are struggling with that. we can either throw an amazing party for 40 people for around $10k or we can have all of our loved ones celebrate with us with a shitty party for $20k.

i'm leaning towards the intimate wedding because it feels more like us and he's leaning more towards the big bash because he thinks we can do it on the cheap by making it into a potluck or just have someone on a bbq flipping costco burgers (i'm not down for that).

how do we find the compromise? there is no in between. there is only 40 or 204 because of the whole ""we can't invite them and not them"" thing. we could easily invite 300+ people if money were no issue, but we aren't comfortable with footing that bill.

halp!

aodsvv,why do people still believe that man made climate change doesn't exist?,9.0,12.0,71.0,NoStupidQuestions,"every time i see facebook posts on climate change (obviously not credible) the top comments are always people saying man made climate change doesn't exist. coming from australia where everyone i have met agrees that it is a man-made issue, it was pretty weird to me that people would even deny it. so googled for a little bit and found that only 40% of us republicans believe in man-made climate change? what? 

&#x200b;

i've seen a lot of people saying that it is a scam to get money from the government which isn't that far fetched in my opinion (i don't really trust governments with much), but literally all evidence suggests that man made climate change is real. 97% of scientists agree on this, [this](https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) link shows hard evidence that temperatures have risen astoundingly with the industrial revolution, more than we've seen for hundreds of thousands of years, which should clear the ""it's a natural process"" argument.  literally all established scientific reports i've read have agreed upon this.

it might just sound like i'm trying to argue for my point, but now i am actually confused as to where this argument comes from. i like seeing both sides of an argument to make my own decision, but it doesn't even seem to be in question here, which is why i am so confused. could someone who does not believe in man-made climate change give their reasoning so i can see both sides here?",1758.0,5683.0,0.85,2019-02-08 08:32:22,BostonClippers,0.0,0.0,12.0,1434.0,244.0,160,0,0.20948617,0.03557312,0.0,0.031620555,0.011857707,0.0,0.04347826,0.023715414,0.03557312,0.011857707,0.007905139,0.007905139,0.007905139,0.03557312,0.05928854,0.0513834,0.015810277,0.015810277,0.007905139,0.03952569,0.0039525693,0.10671937,0.0,0.0,0.0513834,0.027667984,0.19762845,0.019762846,0.031620555,0.0,0.03557312,0.011857707,0.04743083,0.0,0.0039525693,0.0,0.0,0.007905139,0.04743083,0.13438736,0.0,0.49407116,0.0,0.011857707,0.0,0.05533597,0.007905139,0.0,0.04347826,0.031620555,0.09881423,0.0039525693,0.019762846,0.0039525693,0.031620555,0.023715414,0.027667984,0.0039525693,0.0,0.015810277,0.04347826,0.023715414,0.019762846,0.06719368,0.11857708,0.16600789999999999,0.03557312,0.11857708,0.0,0.0039525693,0.0039525693,0.0,0.027667984,0.0,0.0,0.10671937,0.07509881,0.0,0.03952569,0.0039525693,0.015810277,0.20948617,0.007905139,0.031620555,0.0,0

okay, so this is a pretty muddy waters. 

as far as i can tell, there doesn’t seem to be anything gained from boycotting a show, to get back at china. but this also opens up the question of, does it ever make sense to boycott anything to hurt it’s country of origin?

hearing so many people talk like this makes see how tough it must be for minorities to get ahead in america. ask me 6 years ago and i would of said systemic racism doesnt exist, but today i see a different story. it breaks my heart looking at my gf and knowing how many people look down on her for her skin. because she would help any of them no matter what.",5669.0,17021.0,0.63,2019-01-09 02:15:14,KingKillerKvvothe,0.0,0.0,8.0,1082.0,212.0,143,0,0.108490564,0.014150943999999999,0.0,0.009433961999999999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08490566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004716980999999999,0.051886793,0.07075471400000001,0.028301887,0.03301887,0.0,0.0,0.03301887,0.009433961999999999,0.09905660000000001,0.018867925,0.009433961999999999,0.023584906,0.018867925,0.13207547,0.03301887,0.07075471400000001,0.0,0.03301887,0.023584906,0.061320756,0.004716980999999999,0.004716980999999999,0.028301887,0.0,0.014150943999999999,0.07075471400000001,0.10377359,0.014150943999999999,0.5566038000000001,0.004716980999999999,0.009433961999999999,0.004716980999999999,0.10377359,0.014150943999999999,0.0,0.023584906,0.03301887,0.051886793,0.004716980999999999,0.004716980999999999,0.0,0.004716980999999999,0.028301887,0.009433961999999999,0.004716980999999999,0.0,0.014150943999999999,0.061320756,0.014150943999999999,0.018867925,0.14150943,0.1273585,0.19339623,0.028301887,0.1509434,0.0,0.004716980999999999,0.004716980999999999,0.0,0.047169812,0.0,0.018867925,0.14622642,0.06603774,0.0,0.014150943999999999,0.018867925,0.08018868,0.18867925,0.0,0.014150943999999999,0.0,0

6exq7t,the time my mom couldn't be happy i got engaged.,75.0,13.0,48.0,JUSTNOMIL,"just a bit of background. me and dh have been married for almost 2 years, been together for 3. we have our first child on the way in august. my mil lives with us(moved in after our engagement and wedding), besides her need to constantly be singing or making some sort of noise and getting old lady cranky, the woman is a saint. i was never close to my family, other than my mom's parents. none of this is that relevant, but i thought i would let y'all get to know me since i'll be posting about my mom quite often, eventually i'll have a name for her.

now, onto my mother. let me start off by saying my mom is always a victim. even with shit where there is no victim. like my engagement for example. 

dh and mil had planned the whole thing together. mil lived in another state at the time, so their brilliant plan was to buy the ring and have it shipped to her house. she would then bring it up with her when she visited for dh's birthday, which was the day he was planning to propose. they planned everything, including the engagement dinner afterwards, which they invited my mom, dad and two sisters to join us. all this, i might add, was planned almost entirely in front of me because i don't speak a lick of spanish and it's their first language. 

we get to the day, he has me get my nails done, because he wants me to look good on his birthday. he wants me to dress cute, because its my birthday. he wants to go to this art festival downtown, because birthday! all this time, he's letting his mom take our picture in random spots downtown, just getting me ready to not ask questions about why she is taking our picture at this particular moment. we get to a spot, we take a few funny pictures, go for the serious shot and i turn around to hug him and he's on one knee. i cry, say yes, he cries, mil cries. everyone is happy. they tell me they have reservations at this nice restaurant a block over and i get there and my folks are there! i run over, hug my sisters to death, show off the ring. instant sour face from mom. maybe it's just the light in her eyes. we go inside, talk wedding plans, eat, everyone is having a good time. except for mom. she has cbf the entire time. i'm too happy to address it and enjoy myself. 

the next day, i text her and asked why she looked like she ate bad fish last night. she tells me it's because she thought dh was going to propose in the restaurant in front of all of them, not just his mom. no clue where she got that idea, so i ask dh. he says nope. what happened was the whole plan from the start, shows me the messages he sent her when they confirmed where and when to meet at the restaurant and whatnot. i told mom that she must of misunderstood the messages(kinda hard to do, dh is a pretty thorough and straight forward guy. messages were clear, but whatever). she starts blowing up my phone about how no, she didn't misunderstand. he changed the plan because he didn't want them there when her baaaabby got engaged. he ruined the night for her by not including her in the engagement, my sister's were disappointed(they weren't) my dad was upset(he wasn't) and she couldn't believe he would just cut them out of the plan like that. he even picked a restaurant that he knew she wouldn't eat at on purpose(my mom eats 4 things, max. i've never seen a pickier eater) so that she couldn't even enjoy the food my new fmil had paid for. i didn't even respond, deleted all her messages and went about my day. i don't have time for her victim complex. i just got engaged and i have a wedding to plan. 

so that's the long version of how my own mother couldn't be excited for my engagement because she wasn't included in the proposal.

asioyl,"the easy patient riser: i help nurses and other healthcare professionals get heavy patients fdom sitting in a wheelchair to standing anywhere, without electricity, in order to prevent injury to caretakers back.",8.0,1.0,210.0,Lightbulb,"my school is having an innovation challenge, grand prize is 3000 dollars, and i need the money for a surgery my insurance won't cover, so i am trying really hard and would love your input.

my mom has been a nurse for over 40 years, and as she has gotten older she's started to have issues with her back. some research shows that over 80% of nurses will have back problems later in their lives. talking to nurses i have found that they feel the greatest stain on their back occurs trying to lift patients from sitting to standing (free body diagrams have shown this to be true, to strain put on a back at that angle trying to move people who can be up to 600lbs is insane). 

the health care industry is obviously huge, and it's only growing with the population. these people take care of you literally since before you're even born. growing obesity in america only adds to the need for a way to lift patients.

the actual design behind the wheelchair is pretty simple. a hydraulic lift under the chair will push it up and tilt the chair (much like the electronic lift chair recliners you commonly see) and tilt the patient up and onto their feet. it's powered by a pump in front that the nurse will push with her foot. it being in front so she can face the patient and steady them as they get up. a simple handle in back will bring the chair back down. the rest of the design will be simple to keep it easy to clean and durable.

 all in all it works more or less like a hydraulic lift table, but at an angle. it is geared twords overweight patients because those are the ones most likely to cause injury. while there are standing wheelchairs on the market, they all have lower weight capacity, rely on electronics, and are very clearly not designed for hospital use. 

so that's a quick overview, if you have any questions please ask, it's good practice for judging, and any recommendations or help you could offer i would absolutely love.",8924.0,11596.0,0.81,2019-02-20 04:22:58,peterjmonday,0.0,0.0,32.0,1941.0,359.0,210,0,0.11699165,0.019498607,0.0,0.0362117,0.0,0.0,0.0027855153000000002,0.011142061000000002,0.04735376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019498607,0.058495822999999995,0.050139274000000005,0.04735376,0.008356546,0.0,0.0027855153000000002,0.08077995,0.0027855153000000002,0.11420613,0.050139274000000005,0.013927577,0.011142061000000002,0.019498607,0.09749304,0.033426184,0.06128134,0.0,0.016713092,0.019498607,0.07799443,0.0027855153000000002,0.008356546,0.016713092,0.0,0.016713092,0.013927577,0.1281337,0.0,0.5459609999999999,0.03064067,0.0,0.0,0.019498607,0.0027855153000000002,0.008356546,0.008356546,0.0027855153000000002,0.04735376,0.0,0.0,0.013927577,0.019498607,0.005571030500000001,0.008356546,0.0,0.0,0.008356546,0.013927577,0.038997214,0.0362117,0.06963788,0.15041783,0.11699165,0.03064067,0.14206128,0.0,0.016713092,0.0027855153000000002,0.0027855153000000002,0.005571030500000001,0.0,0.013927577,0.08077995,0.09749304,0.0,0.0362117,0.019498607,0.04178273,0.18941504,0.0,0.019498607,0.016713092,0
70azz1,uk ticket competition scam?,32.0,13.0,27.0,Metal,"i couldn't think of a better word for it than scam, it's not so much a scam but a little sneaky. 

last month, i entered a competition for a metal festival in birmingham that had alestorm headlining. didn't think too much about it, just entered on facebook. alestorm is my sisters favourite band, and i don't really like them. 

anyway, i won tickets! i looked into it, 6 tickets apparently, i'd never won anything in my life. i was shaking a little (yeah go on laugh at me, i feel silly anyway). so i look a little more and they want £10 a ticket booking fee. okay, i wasn't planning on spending £60 but i already told my sister i'd won and my parents wanted to go too. so i booked it. i mean, i never win anything and the fact that i won made it feel like i should appreciate it and just go. 

since then, i've seen about 20 different people post about winning the competition, and they keep deleting and renewing the facebook ad every time it gets so many comments. 

i feel quite duped. i looked into the tickets and the prices are only £40 for tickets with the fee. i impulse purchased because i felt i had won something. 

i don't know, are they literally selecting everyone who entered? has anyone else 'won'? is this something that everyone knows about except me? what is going on with this?

edit: if i lived nearby i would probably just go and not think too much of it, but we live 100 miles away and it's going to cost a fair bit for accommodation. they offered some ""vip"" rooms for ""reduced prices"" in the winner e-mail.

i’ve been having sleeping trouble for the past few years on and off, usually a few months of being incapable of falling/staying asleep followed by a month or two of a regular sleeping pattern, and then it returns to being unable to sleep again. for the past 6 months or so i’ve been incapable of sleeping. it takes me at least 5-6 hours after going to bed to finally fall asleep, and the rare time i do fall asleep quickly i can’t stay asleep for more than 3/4 hours at a time. i’ve tried everything i can think of to fix it but nothing has worked - i’ve tried regular exercise, changing my diet, cutting caffeine, staying out of bed during non sleeping times, staying away from phone/screens for an hour before trying to sleep. none of it has worked, anything that has helped at all quickly stops working after a few days and i’m back to square one again. on nights that i haven’t been able to sleep at all i’ve tried staying up all day so that i might sleep early that night and get back into a regular routine but i always end up waking up after about 3 hours anyway and am then awake all night again. 

last night i took a sleeping tablet (1mg of lormetazepam) to try get to sleep at a reasonable time but it never worked. this was my first time ever taking any sleep medication so it’s not due to a tolerance being built up. i felt somewhat drowsy about 30 minutes after taking the tablet but that wore off and i remained awake for hours, not falling asleep until about 7/8am as per usual.

9xuvvg,overlord reminded me of the thing (1982),3.0,0.0,40.0,horror,"i need a second viewing of overlord because my first was ruined by my own expectations, i'm just glad i was able to recognize a fucking good movie.  what i expected was a fun romp with classic zombies, what i got instead was creature movie gold.  see the zombies in overlord are not really zombies in the traditional sense, they have more in common with mutants and monsters if that makes any sense.  

overlord is a slow burn with the backdrop being nazi occupied france in the middle of an invasion and it all fits together perfectly.  the nazi zombies are not a mindless horde to keep at bay but hit and miss experiments that sometimes retain their intelligence or are mindless beasts that will attack friend or foe alike.  the protagonists adapt to their situations very well with corporal ford stealing the show!  his cold persistence to get the job done is nothing more than movie magic. 

and the villain,  pilou asbaek, perfect for an ss nazi captain rapist.  my favorite line from that movie ""i'm going to win this one, corporal.""

here's my boot order

90hw7v,can i [m22] contact my ex [f19]?,1.0,1.0,32.0,BreakUps,"okay before i get into detail, let me just tell you that i don't want stupid answer like ""never contact her"", etc... if that is the answer then please give out reasons as i am a serious mess at the moment and i need real advice.

almost 3 weeks ago i broke up with my then girlfriend of 1 1/2 years. altough i initiated it, she said that she understood so we ended it mutually altough i suspect that she didn't really mean it and just tried to be nice. we promised that we would stay friends.

the relationship itself was perfect altough it had it's ups and downs because of jealousy, fights and stupidity as it was both our first relationship. she was great! she was kind, helpful, beautiful, cute, innocent, sometimes childish but in a good way, and while she had issues like insecurity and jealousy, it got better. during the month before our breakup i would increasingly get agitated for no reason and i kept making her sad (she said that was not true but i could tell that it was). i was less happy than before. i will attend university in another country which played a role in my decision to break up.

these past 3 weeks have been a mess for me (and i'm sure for my ex too, we haven't had any contact since then). i constantly regret it. i used the time apart to analyse our relationship objectively and i realise that i was not a great boyfriend. while my ex would do small things that show her love for me, i didn't. i stupidly took our relationship for granted and while i showed that i love her, i should have showed it more. i think the main reason i broke up was because i was scared of the future, i was scared that a long distance relationship wouldn't work, i was scared of hurting her during the ldr, i was scared of seeing her cry but mostly i was a coward.

i want to have contact again with her. i want to be with her again, i know that should we end up together again, i would do everything in my power to keep her! i would do the things i should have done and avoid doing things i shouldn't have done in the first place. honestly, even if we would not end up together again but still be friends i would be extremely happy though sad.

i guess the advice i need is this. can i contact her? should i even contact her because of my ""behaviour"" in the relationship. if it is acceptable to contact her, how long should i wait? if possible i want to conact her at least next week but that might be too early.

tl;dr: 1.5 year relationship ended since 3 weeks, can i contact her? if so, can i do it now or do i need to wait?",223.0,564.0,1.0,2018-07-20 20:20:44,Brit_in_Lux,0.0,0.0,7.0,2540.0,493.0,239,0,0.14545454,0.016161617,0.002020202,0.046464648,0.0,0.004040404,0.002020202,0.008080808,0.048484847000000005,0.008080808,0.008080808,0.002020202,0.012121212,0.06464647,0.044444446,0.092929296,0.054545455,0.014141414,0.012121212,0.038383837999999997,0.002020202,0.13535354,0.006060606,0.0,0.024242423,0.014141414,0.16161616,0.024242423,0.07474747,0.0,0.042424243,0.056565657000000005,0.105050504,0.0,0.002020202,0.042424243,0.0,0.012121212,0.07878788,0.1010101,0.022222223,0.630303,0.002020202,0.004040404,0.0,0.11111111,0.006060606,0.0,0.026262626,0.004040404,0.068686865,0.002020202,0.002020202,0.0,0.008080808,0.022222223,0.046464648,0.0,0.0,0.018181818,0.016161617,0.046464648,0.02020202,0.17575757,0.1010101,0.24444444,0.012121212,0.15353535,0.0,0.018181818,0.002020202,0.014141414,0.01010101,0.0,0.042424243,0.13737373,0.054545455,0.0,0.026262626,0.0,0.09090909,0.2060606,0.02020202,0.006060606,0.002020202,0
aodsvv,why do people still believe that man made climate change doesn't exist?,9.0,12.0,71.0,NoStupidQuestions,"every time i see facebook posts on climate change (obviously not credible) the top comments are always people saying man made climate change doesn't exist. coming from australia where everyone i have met agrees that it is a man-made issue, it was pretty weird to me that people would even deny it. so googled for a little bit and found that only 40% of us republicans believe in man-made climate change? what? 

&#x200b;

i've seen a lot of people saying that it is a scam to get money from the government which isn't that far fetched in my opinion (i don't really trust governments with much), but literally all evidence suggests that man made climate change is real. 97% of scientists agree on this, [this](https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) link shows hard evidence that temperatures have risen astoundingly with the industrial revolution, more than we've seen for hundreds of thousands of years, which should clear the ""it's a natural process"" argument.  literally all established scientific reports i've read have agreed upon this.

it might just sound like i'm trying to argue for my point, but now i am actually confused as to where this argument comes from. i like seeing both sides of an argument to make my own decision, but it doesn't even seem to be in question here, which is why i am so confused. could someone who does not believe in man-made climate change give their reasoning so i can see both sides here?",1758.0,5683.0,0.85,2019-02-08 08:32:22,BostonClippers,0.0,0.0,12.0,1434.0,244.0,160,0,0.20948617,0.03557312,0.0,0.031620555,0.011857707,0.0,0.04347826,0.023715414,0.03557312,0.011857707,0.007905139,0.007905139,0.007905139,0.03557312,0.05928854,0.0513834,0.015810277,0.015810277,0.007905139,0.03952569,0.0039525693,0.10671937,0.0,0.0,0.0513834,0.027667984,0.19762845,0.019762846,0.031620555,0.0,0.03557312,0.011857707,0.04743083,0.0,0.0039525693,0.0,0.0,0.007905139,0.04743083,0.13438736,0.0,0.49407116,0.0,0.011857707,0.0,0.05533597,0.007905139,0.0,0.04347826,0.031620555,0.09881423,0.0039525693,0.019762846,0.0039525693,0.031620555,0.023715414,0.027667984,0.0039525693,0.0,0.015810277,0.04347826,0.023715414,0.019762846,0.06719368,0.11857708,0.16600789999999999,0.03557312,0.11857708,0.0,0.0039525693,0.0039525693,0.0,0.027667984,0.0,0.0,0.10671937,0.07509881,0.0,0.03952569,0.0039525693,0.015810277,0.20948617,0.007905139,0.031620555,0.0,0

it’s not wrong to cast white people as characters from live adaptations of anime because most anime borrow from american science fiction anyways.

there are three movies almost all anime movies and series borrow from. 
blade runner
star wars
robocop
take as much pieces from these movies and throw them together and you get akira, ghost in the shell, cowboy bebop, vampire hunter d and battle angel. the list goes on forever. 

anime like inuyasha and princess mononoke sure cast japanese actors for those adaptations but if you are mad about remakes like ghost in the shell, you’re just whining for whining’s sake. 

some of the characters even look like they are of european decent in famous anime. annie lionheart and that white haired guy from gits.

words like 'parent' give me the heebiejeebies these days, so let's call my progenitors 'mr and mrs einstein'. i've been nc for 6+ years so don't worry :)

previous episode: [https://www.reddit.com/r/justnofil/comments/9vu8sl/mr\_einstein\_and\_the\_tv\_remote\_aka\_the\_only\_time\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/justnofil/comments/9vu8sl/mr_einstein_and_the_tv_remote_aka_the_only_time_i/)

now this story is a bit complicated, so bear with me. **tldr** at the end. also i keep some things vague for anonymity.

\---

mr&mrs einstein lived in a city with a historical center that, aside from attracting lots of tourists, also meant you had to walk a lot. i was 21 and was living in a different city not very far from there, but i still visited on the regular. within 15 minutes walk of the einsteins house was a certain health care clinic. it just so happens that when i was 21 i needed minor surgery from one of the doctors that worked part time in that clinic. how very convenient! all the consults could happen right there and only the actual surgery would have to be in a hospital further away. it was a great plan.

surgery day comes. i plan to stay with the einsteins for at least a few days after. this is in part because i would have a check up right the next day at the clinic near their house. i was prepared. i had read all of the instructions. i had done all of the necessary things. mr einstein is with me for support (/s). it was all gonna be just fine. now this here is a crucial detail: i was not allowed to eat a few hours before, but i *was* allowed to drink, as long as it wasn't caffeinated. so i had a small hot chocolate in the waiting room. it was allowed, i was hungry, and they had it right frikking there in the waiting room. sue me.

finally i get called up. i get prepped, put in gowns and hairnets and whatnot, and walked to the anesthesiologist. i was supposed to get this general drowsiness stuff (don't know the english word sorry) and some strong local anesthetic, but i wasn't supposed to go fully under. the guy first puts an iv in my tiny wriggly ass veins and injects me with the drowsy stuff. he waits for it to start taking hold. then, for the local, he comes at me with a giant ass needle.

guys! guys. this giant ass needle was supposed to go in a very sensitive place. it was fucking. giant. i'm normally a pretty anxious person to begin with, but i'm not a wuss. i will sit still and grind my teeth and think about king and country. but not this time. not for this needle.

i begin freaking out a little. he tells me 'it's ok you won't feel much because of the drowsy stuff'. i don't feel very drowsy though? which i tell him. he gives me some extra. waits a minute. comes at me again with the needle. 'dude! seriously! not drowsy!' 'well i understand it's not pleasant', he says, 'but be a fucking adult for a second.' (i'm paraphrasing). i feel pressured and do what he says. every cell in my body *screams* at me to punch him and the nurse and run away from the giant ass needle. but i don't and i let him stick me. 'see, that wasn't so bad!' (it was bad. i still didn't punch him.)

the guy and the nurse walk me next door into the actual operating room. whole team of green masks stares at me. they start positioning me into place. and i realise there's something very wrong. there are a lot of people pushing and pulling near and at my surgery site and i can feel it. they're supposed to cut me open in a second and i can *feel them fucking touching me*!! but i've been trained all my abused life not to rock the boat. *what do i do*?!? i silently start crying. and that was my saving grace. the doctor in charge asks me if i'm crying. i babble something. he says 'i can't work like this' and shooes me out.

now, i was really fucking upset. i just disappointed a room full of people. i didn't get the surgery we'd worked towards for weeks. why didn't the anesthesia work? what am i going to tell mr einstein? what's going to happen with my surgery? i was so confused and distraught. the rest of the day is kind of a blur.

the one thing i remember from after my surgery is that the einsteins completely fixated on that damn hot chocolate. 'there was so much sugar in there!' exclaimed mrs einstein the self taught health nut. 'you should've known! they said no cafeine!' 'there's no cafeine in hot chocolate mother.' 'no but sugar!! it's just as bad for you, i told you that!!' so... not only did i not have a (minor but) necessary surgery and no idea how to fix that, now everything was my fault as well.

the next day was supposed to be my check up, and apparently mr einstein and the doctor had decided we would use this time to make a new game plan. i was still feeling really unsettled and upset and confused. we walked to the clinic and had our talk. i don't remember a single word. i was really not processing any of this very well. i also couldn't figure out why everyone was mad at me. i spent the walk back trying to figure stuff out.

during our walk back we hit a quiet part of the street and apparently this was the perfect time for mr einstein to say something. 'your mother won't be home when we get back.' 'oh, ok', i say, not really listening. 'she's at the hospital right now for an appointment because she discovered she has breast cancer.'

**snap**

...

i feel something snap in my brain. my head snaps up to look at him. and the first coherent thought that comes to my mind is: *he's crazy i need to run*.

not, *my poor mother*.

not, *oh god she's going to die*.

***he's crazy i need to run***

my whole body kicked into high gear. i could feel ""me"" detach and ""survival mode"" take over. and i was still staring at him, my brain stuck on that one thought: *he's crazy i need to run* *he's crazy i need to run* *he's crazy i need to run* *he's crazy i need to run* *he's crazy i need to run* *he's crazy i need to run* *he's crazy i need to run* *he's crazy i need to run* *he's crazy i need to run*

i don't remember what i said. i know i just kept going through the motions of going home and acting ""normal"". i do remember him looking at me weirdly, probably because i wasn't crying or having any visible reaction at all, really. *if you expected me to have emotions about* ***my mother having cancer*** *why did you tell me in the middle of the fucking street?!?*

i wanted to leave so. freaking. bad. i was supposed to stay there for at least another few nights, but i didn't think i could do it. only one problem: my sweet little sister, barely 17. what would they do to her? i was the scapegoat and she was the golden child, so she was less resilient. i was afraid they would hurt her. so i stayed. i waited until she came home from school, my mind still stuck on *he's crazy i need to run.* i watched her go about her routine. *he's crazy i need to run.* i watched mrs einstein come home and call a family meeting. *he's crazy i need to run.* i watched them gently tell her and her running to her room crying. *he's crazy i need to run.* i stayed that night, so i would be there if my sister needed me. and in the morning, i left.

5dqqd8,lore help!,4.0,8.0,10.0,worldbuilding,"i was having trouble coming up with an idea and i was wondering if you all lovely people could help me out.

in my world there are two dwarven kingdoms residing on opposite mountain ranges in an east to west spectrum of the continent. the two kingdoms are incredibly similar in culture excepting the language. the eastern dwarves worship the lighting god dalagog, but the western dwarves are a blank slate.

so my question is this: how could there be two separate kingdoms of very similar cultures on opposite ends of the continent? what caused them to divide? do the western dwarves serve a different deity? was there a cultural rift? give me your ideas!

9r0zvm,i’m a daca recipient and have been a proud conservative for years. ama!,0.0,1.0,71.0,Conservative,"i was brought here legally when i was five years old and then fell out of status by overstaying a tourist visa. i quickly adapted to the american way of life, learned to speak english, deeply studied the history of this country, and did my best. fun fact: i was the only student in a class of 60 to get a 5 on the ap united states history exam in high school. one of the coolest moments of my youth, and it happened during a deep bout of shame shortly after i found out i was undocumented.

when i was eighteen, i had the choice to leave and go back to my birth country. i loved the usa too much and couldn’t part with it. i understand many of you will think that, in order to be philosophically consistent, i should have left as soon as i was able, and i respect that. i just couldn’t bring myself to do it. 

i do think daca was an overreach of executive power. i think the president does have the right to prioritze enforcement more or less in certain areas, but the creation of social programs is not within his rights. i accepted it to contribute to my household and work, which i couldn’t do before that. 

i believe the democratic party panders to the poor and to immigrant families because they know that these people come from socialist or socialist-leaning countries and will vote democrat when naturalized. it makes me sick.

god-willing, i’ll likely be getting married next year to my girlfriend and eventually naturalized. the day i become a us citizen will easily be one of the proudest moments of my life. my children will never forget how god smiled on them by letting them be born here.

when the day comes that i can finally vote, i’ll be voting for the party that trusts americans with their own money, protects our rights to defend ourselves against tyranny, and stands up for the family unit.

if for whatever reason i’m deported, even if it’s by this administration, i have no right to hate this country or complain. it gave me an incredible upbringing, education and memories. i have a college degree that would surge me into the top 1% wherever i go. 

don’t let the left fool you: there are immigrants on the right that love this country and what it stands for.",1534.0,1175.0,0.5,2018-10-24 19:05:55,RemyBucksington,0.0,0.0,13.0,2186.0,403.0,244,0,0.12592593,0.019753087,0.0049382720000000005,0.04197531,0.0049382720000000005,0.0,0.0024691360000000002,0.0,0.05185185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014814815,0.044444446,0.04691358,0.054320987,0.02962963,0.0024691360000000002,0.0024691360000000002,0.06913580000000001,0.0,0.10123457,0.012345678999999998,0.0,0.012345678999999998,0.0074074073,0.08395062,0.024691357999999997,0.07160494,0.0,0.019753087,0.01728395,0.09876543,0.0074074073,0.0024691360000000002,0.0,0.0,0.022222223,0.04938271599999999,0.09629629599999999,0.0024691360000000002,0.5777778,0.0074074073,0.0024691360000000002,0.0074074073,0.09382716,0.0,0.0,0.032098766,0.022222223,0.05925926,0.012345678999999998,0.0024691360000000002,0.0074074073,0.022222223,0.01728395,0.01728395,0.0,0.0,0.01728395,0.0049382720000000005,0.034567900000000006,0.044444446,0.11851852,0.13580246,0.17777778,0.012345678999999998,0.16296296,0.0049382720000000005,0.009876544000000001,0.0074074073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0024691360000000002,0.06666667,0.07654321,0.0,0.014814815,0.009876544000000001,0.06666667,0.17777778,0.0074074073,0.034567900000000006,0.0049382720000000005,0

a78t51,i (m25) was just threatened by my gf's (f20) dad (m56) because he doesnt want me to see her,6.0,7.0,91.0,relationships,"my gf and i have been going out for almost a year. she is a college gymnast and student, and i work full time and am a student. she is black and i am white. 

she was a virgin, never done drugs or even drank and was very sheltered. she is really cool and fun and you wouldn't think she was sheltered, but because of how her father is and she went to a small private high school she didnt make many friends. i was the opposite. at the age of 16 i went from being an athlete to partying. i got into alcohol, and then drugs. by 17 i was a heroin addict. i used til i was 19. i went to treatment several times then got clean after i moved away. from there i got my life back i together. i stayed sober for a year before i started working and then i got my ged. i then got a better job working in medical manufacturing. it inspired me to go to school to become an engineer. math has always come easy to me and i loved the environment so i decided to pursue it. for the last three years i have been in school and am now at a university close to getting my bachelors done with. i am still with the manufacturing company because they treat me really well, work with my schedule and have given me a special position where i make really good money while i'm in school....

so i haven't drank or done drugs in over 6 years, have a great job, am almost done with school and for the last year i have been living very healthy and go to the gym almost daily....

her father is one of those really religious crazy parents and a crazy athlete parent. he has told her she cant date until shes done with medical school. she still lives at home because it's next to the university. she cant work because of her busy and demanding schedule with gymnastics and school, so she relies on her parents for money and stuff. i try to help her but she won't let me...

because of how her father is and because hes threatened her from dating she had to keep me a secret. her mother, sister(older doesnt live at home), brother(older doesnt live at home) and all her friends know about me though. her father has physically hurt her multiple times and she believes hes bipolar. he can go from a good dad to a violent asshole in a second. 

my gf and i are completely in love and everything was going amazing. her family supported us and everyone thought it was time to tell her father that she liked someone. 

she told her father several nights ago and he was happy for her. i was shook. he said he wanted to meet me and all that stuff. her mom has been supportive the whole time and was telling him how i seem like a good man. it was a huge relief that he now knew and accepted....

the next morning i wake up to multiple texts from my gf. basically he completely flipped the switch. a couple months ago my gfs sister did a background check and saw that i had a paraphernalia charge from 2011 on my record. the night my gf told her dad about us, she told her sister that she told her dad. i guess her sister, who acted like she supported us, called her dad and told him i was a ""druggy"". this is what caused her father to go insane. 

the whole family started fighting. her father went after my gf because she was defending me. her mom had to get between them so he didnt hurt her. my gf explained how it was something from my past and i am completely different now, but he didnt care. ge then started saying all these things he didnt like about me, and forbid her to see me... we are in love and she cant just stop seeing me. all we wanted was for him to give me the chance to meet him and then make up his decision. he said he would never meet me because i am never going to be a part of his family. he started calling me a perverted drug addict and demanded she told me to get lost. 

oh and he was also saying that because i was good looking that i wasn't actually a virgin. before i met my gf i was. up til i was 19 i had chances but never went through with them because when i was younger(12) an older girl pressured me into doing sexual stuff, and ever since then i had a horrible feeling of guilt every time i was about to have sex so i always backed out. which i'm glad of now. my gf was the first woman i didnt get this feeling with. we waited a few months before we had sex, but when we did i didnt get that feeling. i think it's because we are in love? anyway, he kept saying i was lying about that. he was attacking my character in every way.... he was also saying he would blow my head off if i didnt leave her alone. 

yesterday they kept fighting about it. i was on the phone with my gf and heard what her mom said:

mom: ""after what we learned yesterday i cant believe you feel the same:

gf: "" you cant judge someone based on stuff that happened more than 6 years ago. i fell in love with who he is now""

mom: ""oh yes you can. i thought you had higher standards""

gf: ""really mom? thanks! hes perfect now and you guys won't even give him a chance....""

it actually hurt hearing her mom say that. i had just bought her a couple christmas gifts the other day and was excited to give them to her. but my gf says those weren't her words and that her mom was also scared of her dad. 

just an hour ago my phone rang and it was my gfs house. i picked it up and said hello. it was her dad. he told me if i didnt leave her alone that her brothers would come after me, then just hung up. 

now idk what to do? i feel so bad for my gf because she has dealt with him her whole life and now she has to deal with this because of me. but we are so in love and we make eachother better. we want to be together forever. the plan was she would move in next fall, but now her father is saying i will never be a part of his family and he wants her to never talk to me. she is saying he doesnt matter and it's his loss if he doesnt want anything to do with her. she says we will always be together and if she loses her family because they won't even give me a chance than that's their loss.

i feel terrible. she has told me how her dad is but i always reminded her that it is her dad and i want them to have a good relationship. i told her we should live closer to her family because i want her to remain close to them, but now they want nothing to do with me. i just wish they knew how much i loved her and how i would never hurt her or do anything bad to her. i wish they could see me how i am now, but they won't give me a chance...

what should i do?

tl;dr my gfs father threatened me because he found out i did drugs when i was younger. even though i've been sober over 6 years he told my gf she cant see me. she told him she wouldn't stop and he went after her and threatened to blow my head off. he then called me tonight and threatened sending her brothers after me if i didnt leave her alone.

a2vmlz,when would you say the disempowement of white males started???,0.0,68.0,62.0,KotakuInAction,"we all know is been going on for quite some time, but would you say there is a particular time???

i like to think the women's suffrage movement and the civil rights era were big causers here, but i don't know exactly if i agree with the premise

i think it started moreso during start of the hippie era. let's all remember, this was when men's fashion was going overboard for its first time. i say the disempowerment got more serious in the 90s with tv shows and the rise of pop culture icons in the least. 

and keep in mind i mean disempowerment more from a social stem rather than a legal or systematic stem. let's use effeminization for a better word.",368.0,1962.0,0.48,2018-12-04 03:31:06,Luciano700,0.0,0.0,10.0,656.0,123.0,89,0,0.1300813,0.040650405,0.0,0.024390243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040650405,0.024390243,0.0,0.0,0.016260161999999998,0.07317073,0.032520323999999996,0.032520323999999996,0.032520323999999996,0.0,0.0,0.09756097,0.008130080999999999,0.06504065,0.0,0.0,0.016260161999999998,0.024390243,0.16260162,0.048780486,0.06504065,0.0,0.048780486,0.024390243,0.06504065,0.0,0.0,0.008130080999999999,0.0,0.016260161999999998,0.05691057,0.1300813,0.0,0.47967479999999996,0.0,0.016260161999999998,0.0,0.048780486,0.008130080999999999,0.0,0.048780486,0.008130080999999999,0.024390243,0.008130080999999999,0.008130080999999999,0.0,0.032520323999999996,0.008130080999999999,0.008130080999999999,0.0,0.0,0.008130080999999999,0.024390243,0.024390243,0.008130080999999999,0.08130081,0.12195122,0.10569106,0.048780486,0.15447155,0.0,0.016260161999999998,0.0,0.0,0.008130080999999999,0.0,0.0,0.08130081,0.048780486,0.0,0.032520323999999996,0.0,0.08130081,0.21138212,0.024390243,0.008130080999999999,0.008130080999999999,0

primary: amd-65, imi uzi

gadget: c4, deployable shield

speed: medium

armor: medium


unique ability:
kólla is equipped with a can of spray glue foam that can be used to fill up drone holes as well as underneath barricaded doors, effectively blocking both sight for foot peekers as well as drones going in to investigate and search for either a bomb, hostage or bio-hazard container. kólla is equipped with 2 spray cans, each can allowing for 2 foam sprays, adding up to 4 sprays in total. the foam glue will still stay in place even if the barricade was destroyed, acting as a very short (5 seconds) slowing agent for attackers when walking through it, as well as giving off squeaking sounds for those who have stepped in it. when walking through the foam, the attackers shoes will emit squeaks whenever they walk through the glue or on any other surface afterwards, the squeaks will last for upwards of 10-15 seconds, defenders of course are not affected by the glue. the foam can be destroyed by either a frag or impact grenade, glaz's sniper can also break the foam in 3 shots, granted he hits the foam and not the floor.

avyr0n,i become emotionally numb when i have sex,1.0,0.0,41.0,sex,"when i have sex i just become emotionally distant, i think i know why but i want to change that and become more emotionally connected next time.

for a bit of background, i hate feeling vulnerable. i was emotionally abused for almost my entire life but don't worry i'm all good :) over the years i kinda just trained myself how to control my emotions because i was sick and tired of feeling sad all the time (i'm 19f now). so now, if i ever feel a second of a negative emotion, i can push it down until i barley feel anything, i know it's really unhealthy but it's a defence mechanism. i can even control myself to not cry, i only cry when i've held it in for way too long, like now i only cry maybe twice a year compared to where as when i was younger, i cried multiple times a week. but i don't want to feel numb when having sex, i have a really high sex drive but i want to be able to enjoy it more without not fully being there if you get what i mean. any advice?",1138.0,57.0,1.0,2019-03-01 03:21:00,AllegraW,0.0,0.0,8.0,967.0,195.0,120,0,0.12820514,0.035897437000000004,0.0,0.046153847000000005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010256411,0.03076923,0.0051282053,0.0,0.0,0.0051282053,0.056410257000000005,0.12307692,0.082051285,0.0,0.010256411,0.010256411,0.046153847000000005,0.0,0.09743589999999999,0.035897437000000004,0.0,0.03076923,0.020512821,0.21025641,0.03076923,0.09230769400000001,0.0,0.06153846,0.025641026,0.046153847000000005,0.0,0.025641026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025641026,0.15384616,0.0,0.6051281999999999,0.020512821,0.0,0.0,0.14871795,0.010256411,0.0,0.056410257000000005,0.041025642,0.041025642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015384615,0.03076923,0.056410257000000005,0.010256411,0.0,0.010256411,0.025641026,0.015384615,0.03076923,0.15384616,0.102564104,0.19487179999999998,0.041025642,0.14871795,0.0,0.010256411,0.0,0.025641026,0.0,0.015384615,0.0,0.010256411,0.046153847000000005,0.0,0.035897437000000004,0.0,0.08717949,0.19487179999999998,0.0,0.0,0.0051282053,0

&#x200b;

\-finally found a friend at college, we're platonic, she's easy to talk to, puts as much genuine effort into listening and caring about what i have to say as i do for her, it's so great to have people to talk to again.

\-i ran 3.5 miles without stopping in my jogging class.

\-i was invited, and joined a dnd group where we all seem to actually care about the game and respecting each other's spotlight and just having fun with chill people.

\-i found an picked up a book by my new favorite author at the library and am eating it up!

&#x200b;

i know that none of these events are necessarily linked through causation to nofap, but spending your time doing other stuff and keeping your mind clear of junk really does help with confidence and drive. cheers everyone! hope you're all having a great day!

awo0pu,three in one,13.0,0.0,12.0,nosleep,"i couldn't afford college so i took several jobs outside of high school. first i worked for a gas station for a year, which i enjoyed. i could sneak out beer out the back and not get in trouble. then i worked for a soda factory. which was pretty cool considering they could pay for my school once had i been there another few years. but there attendance policy was insane. i went to work with the stomach virus and they wouldn't let me go home. i had to quit working every twenty minutes either cause i had to shit or puke. they gave me hell about vomit on my uniform and my productivity being low. eventually i stormed out. 

i took a break when my sister died. she just turned 14 and hung herself. we had her stay at an asylum for a few years because she was determined clowns were out to get her and see seen them. it put so much stress on our family. my mom took up smoking and my dad began drinking jim beam more than usual. he got on disability after a forklift accident.

i took a job as a custodian for that mental institution. they knew me and they did do everything they could to help sis. i did spend a lot of time cleaning puke and poop.  poop was always smeared on the walls of rooms.

i definitely did see some horrific things. the worst thing i seen was an old woman chugging a fresh pot of coffee. it didn't even faze her. i've seen some cradle feces as it if were a baby. they gave me one rule and not to talk to a man at the end of the hall. his name was john.

johnny had a condition that he believed he was himself, satan, or a child at times. they showed me footage of him reading faulkner while sipping tea, him laughing in the floor playing with a ball, and he would sit there and wreck havoc. he convinced patients to kill themselves.

well i avoided him until recently. i was instructed to clean his room while he was strapped down. he wasn't allowed to see patients anymore for obvious reasons.

he had his eyes closed when i walked in and security followed me in. i cleaned up candy wrappers they snuck medicine in. cleaned the toilet. and set out a new pad to sleep on. security changed it later.

i turned around and he was sitting up. restraints off. he started talking like we probably would. security walked over 

""alright jon were going to leave now. no trouble needed.""

he stared in my eyes. ""the mind is a funny thing. when you think about your breathing, you have to make yourself breathe. when you think about your body moving, you have to make your body move. you can't think. same for blinking.""

""yeah that's strange ain't it.""

""your sisters mind was quite fun.""

my mouth dropped. according to his records he didn't get here until four years after her death.

""the clowns were real. and they know your name too. except they aren't clowns. some walk among us.""

i turn around and security smiled ear to ear. black pupils. ""hey john, what's your name again?"" they both started to laugh.

somehow i sprinted out fast enough. they didnt chase me.

no ico, no airdrop, and minimal pre-mine mean that this coin hasn’t circulated yet. and as of two weeks before the release of the main net, very little people know about this project.
the project itself is exciting and has huge amounts of potential, and there’s a good team backing it up.
these are perfect conditions for an extremely early adopter, and i’m ready to jump on mochimo when that main net comes out.

now, here’s what i want to know from you.
where do you think mochimo will go in the coming months into the coming years? what are your concerns? what makes you excited? what do you think the price and value of mochimo will be? do you think mochimo will make a big impact in the crypto space?",5378.0,4941.0,0.81,2018-06-18 11:28:29,stellarpasta,0.0,0.0,2.0,813.0,150.0,99,0,0.1589404,0.03311258,0.0,0.046357617000000004,0.0066225166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0397351,0.03311258,0.0,0.0,0.013245033,0.059602648,0.06622516,0.046357617000000004,0.0066225166,0.0,0.0,0.0794702,0.0,0.105960265,0.0,0.0,0.013245033,0.01986755,0.09271523,0.013245033,0.059602648,0.0066225166,0.0066225166,0.0066225166,0.06622516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0397351,0.0,0.18543047,0.0,0.57615894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03311258,0.0,0.0,0.0397351,0.0397351,0.08609272,0.0066225166,0.0,0.013245033,0.046357617000000004,0.01986755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013245033,0.0,0.046357617000000004,0.01986755,0.07284768,0.13245033,0.1589404,0.0066225166,0.17218544,0.0,0.03311258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052980132,0.07284768,0.0,0.0066225166,0.0,0.052980132,0.21192053,0.0,0.026490066,0.0397351,0

adpilo,mother maple,39.0,4.0,12.0,nosleep,"mother maple has been around me for as long as i can remember.

my mom told me that no one else can see her besides her and me. mother maple couldn't talk and was going to be like another parent i guess. it was just me and my mom. my dad was never in the picture. 

mother maple was there when i slept, when i had birthday parties, when i had baseball games, when i graduated from lsu, when i got my dream job as an accountant, and even when i got married.

with age i realized not to show her too much attention so kids wouldn't think i was weird. i never even told my wife that maple sat on the front pew at our wedding.

she had such smooth brown skin, gray hair, a very kind smile. she usually wore a red plaid dress and a white apron with a few stains.

she may have never talked but the way she would look at me knew if i was doing good. like, the time in middle school me and my friends looked at a playboy magazine. she gave me a very disgusted look at night when i laid down.

i often questioned if mother maple would be in my children's life. obviously they would bring it up to their mom. me and mom would talk about her often. she was around my mom as a girl too. once she had me, mother maple was with me more. even though my mom could still see her. sadly, my wife can't have kids. and adoption was too expensive

she was there when my mom died. i never thought my moms death would be because a bullet went through her skull. 

i guess between the stress of all this i started drinking heavily. i lost my job. they found out i was mixing coffee and whiskey. i didn't really get that drunk at work which is weird

i told my wife about her. my wife must have thought i was crazy. it does sound weird that a woman follows me around. being there when i was taking exams in class, when i was hiking, when we were on our honeymoon, and even when i got fired. my wife suggested i quit drinking. she was gonna go stay the weekend with her family while i sorted through my problems. which isn't healthy for a marriage but i understood.

i shouted out to mother maple that i hated her. i wanted her to leave. 

around the time i finished jugging a fifth of some really cheap tequila. i started to smell something rotten. it smelled like raw meat that has sat in the sun. i look up and it's mother maple.

she was usually ten feet away from me at most. but now she was three feet away. she was naked this time. her ole southern belle dress was gone. she was the smell i noticed. her beautiful eyes didn't have the brown in them that used to be there. only white. what's worse is blood is pouring down them.  she follows every step i take. i even tried running and she runs too.

my wife doesn't smell anything and she doesn't see anything. she's even stepped in the blood puddles. she decided to move out.

i don't know if i hurt maple. or what i can do to fix it. i've apologized a dozen times. but i'm sorry mother maple.

i have a feeling this had something to do with my mom's suicide.

i've been playing for a few years now (definitely not fantastic, but i feel like i'm at a solid intermediate level), and i have to admit whenever i can i carry my breedlove like a kid with a security blanket, generally just as something to fidget with and get my mind in a good spot in stressful situations. i love playing for people, but generally in situations like that i'm just keeping it to myself in between socializing. however, i know quite often ""that guy with the guitar"" at parties (or casual gatherings) is viewed as kind of a douche. my question is: how do i avoid that?

a9d0jn,why do black conservatives obsessively moan and whine about rap music and never go after the root of the problem?,7.0,6.0,113.0,MGTOW,"don't get me wrong, i am not saying they're sjw-minded and nor think rapping about violence against women is cool, but a big talking point with black conservatives is how degrading rap culture is to women and is holding them back, yet these dipshits never seem to talk about the root cause of the problem which is black feminism and the absence of positive male empowerment figures... and not only that, but is the damn women who perpetuate the bad boys in the fucking first place smhhhhh

but nah let's just whine and bitch about how rap is sexist, homophobic, pro-violence, and not go after the real causes which are black feminism, the lack of fathers and the rise of the welfare state. holy shit, tupac and 50 cent are real black republicans, not these bandwagoners who are trying too hard to just sound white and please their white counterparts so bad...

don't get me wrong though, i totally have more appreciation for a black conservative than a liberal one, because they own more responsibility and logic than a black liberal, but it amazes me how they have the balls to call out rap culture and not go after the root of the problem. 

tupac had way more red pills than any other black conservatives today

""there is a difference between women and bitches""

i work hard. i want to start a business which is even more work.

i'm concerned that i'll be unable to work as hard as others because of the interplay between bipolar and stress.

do you guys know of any bipolar people who have been able to succeed under much stress/strain and long work hours?

i don't want to have an episode because i'm pushing 60 - 80 hours a week for success.

az5c1k,aita for not pretending like my roommate is going to be a doctor?,18.0,23.0,65.0,AmItheAsshole,"obviously in order to be a doctor, you have to be smart, you have to be convincted, study hard, and you also probably have to have a talent for the feild of science already, and you should be mentally stable, be able to perform well under stress. i mean getting into med school is not easy, and being a doctor sure as hell isn't a cake walk, extremely so depending on the feild. my roommate is none of those things. at all. he says he wants to be a pediatric surgeon.

we are both freshman. he got all c's through highschool, but says that it's just because he didn't try. now in college he's saying he doesn't study or try because this is ""just the basic stuff"" and he will try harder once he gets to the advanced stuff. i'm a bio major, so right now our courses have a lot of crossover. he can't do the homework, but i refuse to help him with it because he doesn't pay attention in class and never studies, the college offers free tutors but he won't go. he flunked general chemistry first semester and still isn't taking it seriously this semester. 

he has anxiety and depression and is very far from a mentally stable person. he's moody and says he gets panic attacks over small tests, again not a trait for a child surgeon. 

he says he loves the feild, but he spends all of his time watching make up videos, he never ever seems interested in his studies in the slightest. 

this semester, we learned that he is only taking 11 credits and working 10 hours as a cashier. he complains all the time about how busy he is none the less even though we know it's all bullshit. 

his parents are from a culture that makes them want for him to be a doctor, his friends are all dumb so they encourage him with no thought behind it, the college only wants his money, i am the only person who i feel is being honest about what is extremely evident. this guy will never be a doctor, and pretending like he will be is just costing him hundreds of thousands of dollars and waisting his time, and i worry about what he will do when he comes to this realization.

edit: forgot tl;dr my roommate wants to be a pediatric surgeon and is going thousands in debt over it, but he doesn't seem to like the feild, and just doesn't have what it takes, and i refuse to act like he's going to make it.

and also just a note, this isn't his ""dream"" i don't think he really wants it at all. he loves make up and fasion and openly says it's his dream. going to college right now is putting him thousands in debt for something that from knowing him, i am pretty sure he doesn't really want.",8923.0,11591.0,0.85,2019-03-09 18:44:01,peterjmonday,0.0,0.0,13.0,2564.0,490.0,240,0,0.15102041,0.040816326,0.0020408162,0.053061225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04489796,0.0,0.008163265,0.0020408162,0.01632653,0.03265306,0.07755102,0.05510204,0.024489796,0.006122449,0.008163265,0.059183672,0.0,0.12244898,0.028571429,0.0020408162,0.018367346,0.03469388,0.14081633,0.012244898,0.07755102,0.0,0.03265306,0.014285714,0.08979592,0.0020408162,0.006122449,0.0,0.0,0.024489796,0.010204081,0.18367347,0.008163265,0.6102041,0.020408163,0.012244898,0.006122449,0.02244898,0.008163265,0.0020408162,0.026530612000000002,0.012244898,0.059183672,0.006122449,0.091836736,0.018367346,0.01632653,0.040816326,0.024489796,0.0,0.0020408162,0.01632653,0.02244898,0.030612245,0.036734693,0.13265306,0.11020408,0.19183673,0.024489796,0.11020408,0.0020408162,0.01632653,0.0020408162,0.0040816325,0.0040816325,0.0,0.08979592,0.15918367,0.04897959,0.006122449,0.02244898,0.0040816325,0.04285714400000001,0.21836735,0.008163265,0.06326531,0.008163265,0

aodsvv,why do people still believe that man made climate change doesn't exist?,9.0,12.0,71.0,NoStupidQuestions,"every time i see facebook posts on climate change (obviously not credible) the top comments are always people saying man made climate change doesn't exist. coming from australia where everyone i have met agrees that it is a man-made issue, it was pretty weird to me that people would even deny it. so googled for a little bit and found that only 40% of us republicans believe in man-made climate change? what? 

&#x200b;

i've seen a lot of people saying that it is a scam to get money from the government which isn't that far fetched in my opinion (i don't really trust governments with much), but literally all evidence suggests that man made climate change is real. 97% of scientists agree on this, [this](https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) link shows hard evidence that temperatures have risen astoundingly with the industrial revolution, more than we've seen for hundreds of thousands of years, which should clear the ""it's a natural process"" argument.  literally all established scientific reports i've read have agreed upon this.

&#x200b;

it might just sound like i'm trying to argue for my point, but now i am actually confused as to where this argument comes from. i like seeing both sides of an argument to make my own decision, but it doesn't even seem to be in question here, which is why i am so confused. could someone who does not believe in man-made climate change give their reasoning so i can see both sides here?",1758.0,5683.0,0.85,2019-02-08 08:32:22,BostonClippers,0.0,0.0,12.0,1434.0,244.0,160,0,0.20948617,0.03557312,0.0,0.031620555,0.011857707,0.0,0.04347826,0.023715414,0.03557312,0.011857707,0.007905139,0.007905139,0.007905139,0.03557312,0.05928854,0.0513834,0.015810277,0.015810277,0.007905139,0.03952569,0.0039525693,0.10671937,0.0,0.0,0.0513834,0.027667984,0.19762845,0.019762846,0.031620555,0.0,0.03557312,0.011857707,0.04743083,0.0,0.0039525693,0.0,0.0,0.007905139,0.04743083,0.13438736,0.0,0.49407116,0.0,0.011857707,0.0,0.05533597,0.007905139,0.0,0.04347826,0.031620555,0.09881423,0.0039525693,0.019762846,0.0039525693,0.031620555,0.023715414,0.027667984,0.0039525693,0.0,0.015810277,0.04347826,0.023715414,0.019762846,0.06719368,0.11857708,0.16600789999999999,0.03557312,0.11857708,0.0,0.0039525693,0.0039525693,0.0,0.027667984,0.0,0.0,0.10671937,0.07509881,0.0,0.03952569,0.0039525693,0.015810277,0.20948617,0.007905139,0.031620555,0.0,0
9d7k0i,my cousin was struck by a drunk driver,0.0,1.0,38.0,legaladvice,"tl;dr drunk driver hit my cousin. lawyer up or let insurance cover it? 

my cousin was hit by a drunk driver while entering her vehicle. her car was totalled and she went flying. she is doing alright in that she is alive, but she has a long road ahead of her in terms of recovery. 

my family seems to think her car insurance company is going to deal with the whole legal battle, but she has dental surgery, drugs, physio, lost wages and everything in between that i don't think they are considering. we are canadian, and don't often think about suing individuals, but i'm not sure we have a choice because she needs to recover and find a way to pay for her life while she does.

do we need to hire a personal injury lawyer or will car insurance cover all of it?

7cwui1,"3 months postpartum, here's what ive learned so far.",183.0,51.0,52.0,BabyBumps,"had my little boy back in august, he just hit 3 months old yesterday. for the rest of you first time mom's, let me tell you what i've learned so far. 

vaseline has been my best friend. put some on their butt after a diaper change, keeps the poo from sticking to them. making it easier to clean and helping prevent possible diaper rash. 

swaddle sacks are a godsend if you can't figure out how to keep their little arms from busting out of a swaddled blanket. i even have a couple that turn into regular sleep sacks for when he's done with the arm binding.

if you're breastfeeding, a feeding pillow(i have a boppy) is wonderful support. get the positioning right, and you can even use both of your hands for other things. works great for bottle feeding, too.

a car seat with a separate base. saved me all the hassle of unbuckling and rebuckling a car seat. i can just pop it off the base and carry the car seat in. not to mention, you don't worry as much about whether it's installed correctly. 

a bouncer. i didn't get anything fancy. just a cheap bouncer. i can take him with me all around the house and not wonder where i'm gonna set him. makes it easy to take him into the bathroom with me if i got to shower.

receiving blankets. tons of them. they're great for everything. burp cloths, swaddling, car seat covers, changing pad. i've used them for nearly everything. 

clamping high chair. i take it everywhere. no need to worry about if where you're going out to eat has a high chair or room for a stroller. i usually clip it to the inside of a booth, no worries about a high chair getting in the way of people passing by or a busy waiter. 

if you're bottle feeding, for all that is good, please get a bottle warmer. it saves you so much time and hassle, especially in the middle of the night. 

having a fussy baby who just won't sleep? put him in a swing, i was gifted a mamaroo and i wouldn't give it up for the world. it's saved me many nights. 

if you're planning on a vaginal birth, consider adult diapers. the giant overnight pads may not cut it for the after birth bleeding.

ladies, postpartum depression is real. it's serious. i spent some time in a mental health facility because my depression got way too serious. there's a difference between baby blues and ppd. if you think you may have it, talk to your ob, they'll tell you what you can do. message me, i'll talk to you, i'll listen. 
 

i'm sure i'm missing something else, this already has gotten too long. anyone has any questions, message me. i'll do my best to respond. 

edit: also, cradle cap happens! you haven't done anything wrong. i had a nurse while i was in the hospital tell me that cradle cap happens because parents don't wash their babys head. not true. it's just one of those things. i've found using regular old baby shampoo and one of these brushes helped get rid of it in about a week. https://www.amazon.com/dp/b011evxiie/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_d5zcab07mfc9h",13190.0,33305.0,0.98,2017-11-14 18:43:44,dixiegal_gonewild,0.0,0.0,9.0,2953.0,538.0,300,0,0.21376811,0.05253623,0.0018115942000000002,0.04347826,0.0,0.0018115942000000002,0.018115941,0.0036231884999999996,0.09057971,0.0018115942000000002,0.0,0.0,0.009057971,0.048913042999999996,0.05253623,0.04347826,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.0054347827,0.07608695,0.0,0.09963768,0.036231883,0.02173913,0.018115941,0.018115941,0.11231884,0.016304348,0.050724637,0.0,0.038043477,0.016304348,0.054347824,0.009057971,0.0054347827,0.0036231884999999996,0.0,0.018115941,0.032608695,0.13043478,0.0018115942000000002,0.5326086999999999,0.010869565,0.0018115942000000002,0.009057971,0.061594203,0.007246376999999999,0.007246376999999999,0.012681159,0.014492753999999998,0.05797101599999999,0.0018115942000000002,0.012681159,0.0036231884999999996,0.027173912,0.023550725,0.018115941,0.0054347827,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.007246376999999999,0.025362318,0.012681159,0.117753625,0.12137681,0.17572464,0.02173913,0.13768116,0.0,0.028985507999999997,0.0036231884999999996,0.0054347827,0.0,0.0036231884999999996,0.010869565,0.106884055,0.072463766,0.0018115942000000002,0.041666668,0.012681159,0.041666668,0.18115942,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.032608695,0

i've been playing for a few years now (definitely not fantastic, but i feel like i'm at a solid intermediate level), and i have to admit whenever i can i carry my breedlove like a kid with a security blanket, generally just as something to fidget with and get my mind in a good spot in stressful situations. i love playing for people, but generally in situations like that i'm just keeping it to myself in between socializing. however, i know quite often ""that guy with the guitar"" at parties (or casual gatherings) is viewed as kind of a douche. my question is: how do i avoid that?

9d7k0i,my cousin was struck by a drunk driver,0.0,1.0,38.0,legaladvice,"tl;dr drunk driver hit my cousin. lawyer up or let insurance cover it? 

my cousin was hit by a drunk driver while entering her vehicle. her car was totalled and she went flying. she is doing alright in that she is alive, but she has a long road ahead of her in terms of recovery. 

my family seems to think her car insurance company is going to deal with the whole legal battle, but she has dental surgery, drugs, physio, lost wages and everything in between that i don't think they are considering. we are canadian, and don't often think about suing individuals, but i'm not sure we have a choice because she needs to recover and find a way to pay for her life while she does.

do we need to hire a personal injury lawyer or will car insurance cover all of it?

my friend was watching youtube and then turned his computer off. he came back 15 minutes later to turn it back on to be greeted with the image above. no drivers or any other download were installed prior to this happening

we have tried other hdmi cables/vga but that doesnt seem to be the problem.

we took out the graphics card out and used the integrated graphics via plugging in the hdmi to the motherboard. this worked...but still unsure if its the graphics card because the graphics card led's were on(gtx 1060 gaming x)

9hftmp,a decent amount of my friends and including my girlfriend think i’m dumb how do i change this image?,2.0,2.0,100.0,Advice,"so i started noticing it when two of my friends and my girlfriend started watching shows together and whenever they would compare me to a character it would be like jerry from rick and morty, mr.peanutbutter from bojack or kevin from the office. 

then every time i say an obvious sarcastic remark or joke about something it’s like they take me serious and all try to correct me as if i’m dumb or something and usually my friends back at home and i make jokes like that all the time so it’s natural for me to make jokes like that because i understand that it’s wrong and that’s the joke. but , they don’t seem to get it i guess?

but i get good grades and i have better common sense than them because it’s shown a lot of the time. however, it’s like it goes unnoticed. 

i’m not one to get bothered by much but no one likes having their intellect challenged. i can be called weak, ugly a chicken. but when i get called dumb or stupid that’s just one thing that bothers me. i don’t make it obvious that it bothers me but it kind of irks me when it happens.

i came up with an app that i wish existed, but being a developer i can see the incredibly complicated reasons why it doesn't.  doesn't matter though, we don't actually have to build the app.

it's a wood species identifier application.  basically, take a pic of a couple sides of your board and endgrain, and the app will tell you that you have eastern red cedar, for example.

i have (survey link) - this has been approved by the mods, and i'd really appreciate any help i can get on this, as i only need a handful of responses. 

thanks!


edit - over 100 responses in less than 24 hours - you people rule.  i only needed 25!  thanks so much!

the project itself is exciting and has huge amounts of potential, and there’s a good team backing it up.
these are perfect conditions for an extremely early adopter, and i’m ready to jump on mochimo when that main net comes out.

aeenej,is my brother a narcissist?,1.0,2.0,27.0,raisedbynarcissists,"wasn’t sure where to post this but seems like the best place to get some opinions on the matter. 

my (20f) younger brother (19m) has always been quite strange. he’s very antisocial as well as quite socially awkward, and doesn’t often leave the house or seem to have a lot of friends. he was very moody and angry growing up, but i considered it to be just teenage angst that most people, including myself, experience while growing up. however, he’s 19 now and still contains the same anger that he should’ve grown out of, and i’ve started to wonder lately if he’s actually narcissistic. 

an example of his behaviour. he and my older brother (26m) are constantly arguing. both live away for college but spend weekends and holidays at home. an ongoing argument is one about the television. one day a week both want to watch something that clashes, so one would have to sacrifice watching what they want for the other. the 19 year old (possible narcissist) can never ever find a way to compromise. he sees the entire thing as unfair and thinks he’s entitled to watch whatever he wants whenever he wants. while arguing about this a few weeks ago, the 19 year old punched my other brother. after this happened, he went downstairs to my parents complaining about how he wanted to watch tv, not mentioning the fact that he’d just physically attacked my older brother. when my parents realised what had happened, he would take absolutely no responsibility for hitting him, saying again and again how he didn’t do anything wrong. my mother tried to speak to him calmly about his behaviour, saying how his anger and outbursts needed to stop as he makes the house into a hostile environment. he again took no responsibility, saying that my mother was making this all about herself and that she needs to stop overreacting, and that his behaviour was being blown out of proportion (it wasn’t). 

this is only one example. his actions are almost always selfish and driven by his own motivations with no regards to anyone else’s feelings, he is incredibly entitled, he seems to think that the whole world should revolve around him and play by his rules. even in his achievements he is entitled. he is of average intelligence and is average at the sports he plays, yet seems to strongly believe that he will be highly successful in anything he does regarding his academics/hobbies. it doesn’t make any sense to me. are these traits of a narcissist? or does he have other issues?

tl;dr : brother is selfish, entitled, angry, and seemingly unrealistic in how he views his own potential. is he a narcissist?",197.0,165.0,0.67,2019-01-10 04:51:30,fuckthegards,0.0,0.0,5.0,2590.0,452.0,264,0,0.1611479,0.028697572999999997,0.0022075055,0.046357617000000004,0.0,0.0,0.0022075055,0.022075055,0.050772625999999994,0.0066225166,0.0,0.0022075055,0.015452539,0.046357617000000004,0.0794702,0.057395145,0.022075055,0.01986755,0.0022075055,0.048565122999999995,0.0022075055,0.09492274,0.0066225166,0.0,0.017660044,0.01986755,0.15452538,0.026490066,0.07726269,0.0,0.03311258,0.026490066,0.06622516,0.01986755,0.0022075055,0.008830022,0.0,0.008830022,0.041942604,0.12362031,0.0022075055,0.56732893,0.0066225166,0.008830022,0.0066225166,0.026490066,0.004415011,0.0,0.030905077000000003,0.022075055,0.06401766,0.017660044,0.09933775,0.0022075055,0.024282562,0.022075055,0.037527595,0.0,0.0022075055,0.015452539,0.028697572999999997,0.017660044,0.017660044,0.121412806,0.12582782,0.18543047,0.026490066,0.14790288,0.0022075055,0.013245033,0.0066225166,0.0,0.013245033,0.0,0.09271523,0.15011038,0.048565122999999995,0.0,0.050772625999999994,0.0022075055,0.07284768,0.18101545,0.0,0.015452539,0.0,0

i’m curious to see whether the judge will hasten the decision to dismiss my complaint or allow it to go to trial. i know that it likely depends on the judge, just want to hear all of your leanings.",1534.0,1175.0,0.8,2019-01-21 04:52:42,RemyBucksington,0.0,0.0,10.0,412.0,80.0,59,0,0.1375,0.0125,0.0125,0.0375,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0,0.0375,0.0125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0375,0.0375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0875,0.0,0.0875,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.175,0.0,0.0375,0.0,0.0625,0.0125,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0125,0.0,0.1625,0.0,0.525,0.0,0.0125,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0375,0.0125,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0125,0.025,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.0125,0.05,0.075,0.15,0.1375,0.025,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0125,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0625,0.0,0.05,0.0125,0.0375,0.2,0.0,0.0125,0.0125,0

aie21i,“i’ll only take your £20 if it’s cash!” - my late night encounter with a homeless lady and her dog,398.0,21.0,98.0,ChoosingBeggars,"long story, so bear with me. i’m also on mobile, so sorry for any bad formatting. tl;dr at end. 

a little backstory: i used to live in london and at the time that this story took place worked for a publisher of inflight magazines in advertising/sales. i consider myself a hard worker and pushed 13h days (unpaid overtime, you could make extra money with commission though.) and was overall pretty successful. 

now, london has a lot of homeless people, more than anywhere else i’ve lived. since i was making a decent amount of money, i wasn’t greedy with it and helped the homeless out if i could - this included cash as well in the beginning. however, one day a shop owner saw me giving £5 to a homeless woman and advised me to instead buy the homeless food/beverages. he said that there’s homeless shelters (the lady said that she was looking to spend the night in a hostel) and that these people *usually* use the money for other things - cigarettes, alcohol, drugs. 

ever since then, i’ve taken his advice to heart and instead of giving change, i offered buy them a sandwich and water from a kiosk, offered cigarettes and pretty much anything along those lines. i’ve had really wonderful experiences doing this and seeing the smiles on their faces and gratitude was more than enough for me to make it worth it. and honestly, these things weren’t very expensive to me, so it’s not like i was being a saint and spending half of my earnings - just a few pounds here and there. it was obviously a lot more to them than it was to me. 

i was never as unfortunate as to be homeless, but i’ve had people pull me out of pretty bad situations previously in my life and i know how much a simple act of kindness can mean when you’re down and at your lowest. 

*now, enough backstory. onto my cb experience.*

this event took place one particular evening when i was out with friends. we were having a few drinks in soho (for those of you familiar with london) and enjoyed ourselves deep into the night. eventually we considered going to a different part of town (liverpool street) and were waiting to catch an uber to get there. 

queue to me seeing a homeless lady (who i’ll call cb) and her doggo. mind you, i was already a little tipsy at this time and enthusiastically asked her if i could pet him, since he was being very friendly. she agreed and seemed to be fairly nice, but since she was homeless my friends were keeping their distance while still keeping an eye on me. you could tell that she was going to be asking for money, which was something that i was prepared for even before i asked to pet her dog. 

**cb** : i hate to ask you this but can you spare £20? i’m trying to get into a hostel for the night, there’s one nearby and it’s the only one allowing dogs. it’s only a few minutes away and i only need £20. 

(i love dogs and she was very sweet up until then. i figure - you know what? i’ll do her this favor so her and her doggo can have a safe place to sleep. even if there’s shelters, i get that sleeping in a hostel is more appealing. plus, i was tipsy. tipsy me is more generous.)

**me** : alright, i’ll help you out.

(her eyes light up surprised, but happy)

**me** : i don’t carry any cash, but if you take me to the hostel, i’ll pay with my card at reception. 

(her complexion immediately changes)

**cb** : no, they don’t like it if too many people come at once and i don’t want it to be too obvious that i’m homeless. can’t you just get cash at an atm and give it to me?

**me** : sorry, i’m not getting cash. look, i’m sure it’ll be fine if you take me to reception, they’re not going to reject a paying customer. 

(she’s visibly becoming more agitated at this point)

**cb** : they don’t accept card anyways. just go to an atm and get cash, that’s more than enough. you don’t have to go there with me, you and your friends are waiting for a cab anyways. 

**me** : we can cancel the uber and get a new one, that’s fine. look, if they really don’t accept cards i can get cash, but i insist on coming with you and paying for the room at reception. i want to make sure that everything is okay and that you are really using the money for a hostel.

(i only ever did this because of what the shop owner said. £20 isn’t a small amount of money and i wouldn’t want it to be used for anything but what she had said. my friends were already urging me to leave it, but the doggo really got to me and i wanted to help.)

**cb** : they won’t allow you in! just give me the cash. 

**me** : why would they reject a potential customer? it doesn’t make sense. 

**cb** : they would only let me in, i don’t want trouble so just give me cash. you said you’d go to an atm with me. if we hurry up you can still make your uber. 

(at this point it was painfully obvious that there was no hostel that she was trying to get to. heck, it was already obvious before but i like to give people the benefit of the doubt. *and doggo!* )

**me** : either you take me to the hostel and i pay there, or i can’t help you at all. sorry.


the sweet lady from before had turned into an aggressive rage monster and proceeded to cuss me out at the end of the conversation. at this point i went back to my friends and not soon after our uber arrived. even as i got in she was giving me a mad glare for not handing her £20 in cash.

i just felt bad for the dog, to be honest. 


*tl;dr: homeless lady asks me for £20 so she can stay at a hostel for the night with her dog. i accept and ask her to bring me to said hostel so that i can pay in person, she makes a bunch of excuses and gets mad when i won’t just give her the cash.*

70jauo,"apparently, i'm rude for making sure my 4 week old doesn't get sick.",556.0,36.0,68.0,JUSTNOMIL,"sorry for formatting, typing this up on mobile with a baby attached to my tits. this is long so...
tl:dr-mil invited people to my house without asking and then got upset because i kept myself and my child away from everyone, including a sick 4yr old.

surprisingly, isn't about cotten-eye-no! this is about my mil, who i usually have no problems with besides a few bec moments. i've called her charo since day one, the lady is hispanic, never shuts up and talks a mile a minute.

for those who don't know, charo lives with me. she stays to herself, a good help around the house. she doesn't really do anything to qualify as a jnmil, she just annoys me with little things like never shutting up, buys things we already have in the kitchen (why do i need two jars of unopened mayo, charo??) she does a lot of business in florida, where she's lived for the last 20something years so she knows quite a few people down there. well, she was in miami for a couple weeks, doing her thing right before irma hit. the day before she's supposed to be back, she tells hubs that she's bringing family friend(ff) and her three girls (g1 who is 12,g2 who is 10, g3 who is 4) back with her to outrun the hurricane. okay, i wish she had asked but i'm not going to say no, they have nowhere else to go. lo ain't had his shots yet, so we have to be careful around the kids, especially the youngest one. i tell hubs this, he says no problem, just keep him away from them. okay, cool. to me, that means locking myself and lo up in my bedroom because that's the only room the kids ain't allowed to be in. 

now, i find out, that a high school friend(hf) of hubs is also gonna stay with us. hf has family in a town over, but they don't have internet because they're old. no problem, what's one more person?  come on over. 

before i get to the main point of this post, i'm gonna bitch about some other stuff. on to the bullets!

•the oldest two kids camped out in my tv room during their stay. we found half eaten food in the couch, panties on the floor and drinks spilled without even an attempt to be cleaned. neither charo nor ff felt it necessary to correct the kids. 

•g2 would not leave lo(when i actually came downstairs) or my animals alone, despite me telling her to do so. charo nor ff thought to make her stop. 

•charo and ff would take off and leave g1 and g2 at my house without asking if i would watch them. i don't know these kids, this is my house. i'll watch them, just ask me first. 

•g3 would constantly scream, she's scared of dogs. i have two pups. not her fault, 4yr olds are gonna scream when scared. charo and ff, again, did nothing but let her scream.

now, onto the point of this post! g3 had a cold(one that she eventually gave my husband). good thing i've decided to lock me and lo in the room! i'm not trying to deal with a 4 week old baby with a cold, i'm barely sleeping as it is. i only come down for meals and to talk to hf a bit. usually i bring lo with me and just don't put him down and stay in a different room from the kids. a few days pass, hurricane threat is over, ff and the kids leave, charo goes out shopping. my house is quiet for once. so me, lo and hf chill out in the tv room, watch narcos and talk. this is how i find out i'm rude. 

hf-""i remember that charo used to talk a lot, but i didn't know she talked so much shit!""

me-""what do you mean?"" 

hf-""well, to be honest, she talked about you. said you were rude for not coming down much and keeping the baby with you.""

az5c1k,aita for not pretending like my roommate is going to be a doctor?,18.0,23.0,65.0,AmItheAsshole,"obviously in order to be a doctor, you have to be smart, you have to be convincted, study hard, and you also probably have to have a talent for the feild of science already, and you should be mentally stable, be able to perform well under stress. i mean getting into med school is not easy, and being a doctor sure as hell isn't a cake walk, extremely so depending on the feild. my roommate is none of those things. at all. he says he wants to be a pediatric surgeon.

we are both freshman. he got all c's through highschool, but says that it's just because he didn't try. now in college he's saying he doesn't study or try because this is ""just the basic stuff"" and he will try harder once he gets to the advanced stuff. i'm a bio major, so right now our courses have a lot of crossover. he can't do the homework, but i refuse to help him with it because he doesn't pay attention in class and never studies, the college offers free tutors but he won't go. he flunked general chemistry first semester and still isn't taking it seriously this semester. 

he has anxiety and depression and is very far from a mentally stable person. he's moody and says he gets panic attacks over small tests, again not a trait for a child surgeon. 

he says he loves the feild, but he spends all of his time watching make up videos, he never ever seems interested in his studies in the slightest. 

this semester, we learned that he is only taking 11 credits and working 10 hours as a cashier. he complains all the time about how busy he is none the less even though we know it's all bullshit. 

his parents are from a culture that makes them want for him to be a doctor, his friends are all dumb so they encourage him with no thought behind it, the college only wants his money, i am the only person who i feel is being honest about what is extremely evident. this guy will never be a doctor, and pretending like he will be is just costing him hundreds of thousands of dollars and waisting his time, and i worry about what he will do when he comes to this realization.

edit: forgot tl;dr my roommate wants to be a pediatric surgeon and is going thousands in debt over it, but he doesn't seem to like the feild, and just doesn't have what it takes, and i refuse to act like he's going to make it.

and also just a note, this isn't his ""dream"" i don't think he really wants it at all. he loves make up and fasion and openly says it's his dream. going to college right now is putting him thousands in debt for something that from knowing him, i am pretty sure he doesn't really want.",8923.0,11591.0,0.85,2019-03-09 18:44:01,peterjmonday,0.0,0.0,13.0,2564.0,490.0,240,0,0.15102041,0.040816326,0.0020408162,0.053061225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04489796,0.0,0.008163265,0.0020408162,0.01632653,0.03265306,0.07755102,0.05510204,0.024489796,0.006122449,0.008163265,0.059183672,0.0,0.12244898,0.028571429,0.0020408162,0.018367346,0.03469388,0.14081633,0.012244898,0.07755102,0.0,0.03265306,0.014285714,0.08979592,0.0020408162,0.006122449,0.0,0.0,0.024489796,0.010204081,0.18367347,0.008163265,0.6102041,0.020408163,0.012244898,0.006122449,0.02244898,0.008163265,0.0020408162,0.026530612000000002,0.012244898,0.059183672,0.006122449,0.091836736,0.018367346,0.01632653,0.040816326,0.024489796,0.0,0.0020408162,0.01632653,0.02244898,0.030612245,0.036734693,0.13265306,0.11020408,0.19183673,0.024489796,0.11020408,0.0020408162,0.01632653,0.0020408162,0.0040816325,0.0040816325,0.0,0.08979592,0.15918367,0.04897959,0.006122449,0.02244898,0.0040816325,0.04285714400000001,0.21836735,0.008163265,0.06326531,0.008163265,0
81f1md,people trying to guilt me into things vent,94.0,14.0,42.0,BabyBumps,"let me preface this by saying that i am continuously setting boundaries and am being mostly successful.  due to being the youngest, and a mostly passive person, my boundaries aren't always being heard with receptive ears.  i just need to vent in a safe place.

my mom is trying to guilt me into having her at the hospital when i'm in labour and she is ignoring me every time i ask her if she's let my uncle know she'll be staying with them while she's in town.  she would be a great help, but i can't play favorites between my parents.

my dad is trying to guilt me into having him stay with us when the baby comes.  he would not be a help.  he is messy and takes energy away from me.  i love him dearly, but he's exhausting due to his untreated depression.

my step mom is trying to guilt me into having her come with three teenage boys, none of whom are vaccinated, and stay at my house the week of my due date because we live close to the mountains and she wants to go skiing over march break.  re: messy, loud, germy as hell and constant attention required... and seriously?  during my due date?

my fil is trying to guilt me into having his new gf meet the baby at the hospital.  i loved my mil, who passed away in a terrible accident two years ago and i don't know or care for this new woman, that i have met once.  she is good for him, so i support the relationship.  it doesn't mean i need her as a spectator when i'm passing massive clots and leaking from everywhere.

i love the enthusiasm of this team and the positive attitude. like they are genuinely excited about what they are discussing. it helps keep the listeners excited about it too. 

i feel like they discuss the story more too. obviously it's hard to discuss everything that happens, but they do a great job covering the whole story. 

i obviously love the other team too, i am just very pleased with these guys. i think you should keep it like this, but have the full team for cosmere episodes. because honestly the cosmere is this podcasts bread and butter. so have an all star team(craig, ryan, todd, megan and ken) for the cosmere, and two teams for other series like you are doing now.

for a bit of background, i hate feeling vulnerable. i was emotionally abused for almost my entire life but don't worry i'm all good :) over the years i kinda just trained myself how to control my emotions because i was sick and tired of feeling sad all the time (i'm 19f now). so now, if i ever feel a second of a negative emotion, i can push it down until i barley feel anything, i know it's really unhealthy but it's a defence mechanism. i can even control myself to not cry, i only cry when i've held it in for way too long, like now i only cry maybe twice a year compared to where as when i was younger, i cried multiple times a week. but i don't want to feel numb when having sex, i have a really high sex drive but i want to be able to enjoy it more without not fully being there if you get what i mean. any advice?",1138.0,57.0,1.0,2019-03-01 03:21:00,AllegraW,0.0,0.0,8.0,967.0,195.0,120,0,0.12820514,0.035897437000000004,0.0,0.046153847000000005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010256411,0.03076923,0.0051282053,0.0,0.0,0.0051282053,0.056410257000000005,0.12307692,0.082051285,0.0,0.010256411,0.010256411,0.046153847000000005,0.0,0.09743589999999999,0.035897437000000004,0.0,0.03076923,0.020512821,0.21025641,0.03076923,0.09230769400000001,0.0,0.06153846,0.025641026,0.046153847000000005,0.0,0.025641026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025641026,0.15384616,0.0,0.6051281999999999,0.020512821,0.0,0.0,0.14871795,0.010256411,0.0,0.056410257000000005,0.041025642,0.041025642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015384615,0.03076923,0.056410257000000005,0.010256411,0.0,0.010256411,0.025641026,0.015384615,0.03076923,0.15384616,0.102564104,0.19487179999999998,0.041025642,0.14871795,0.0,0.010256411,0.0,0.025641026,0.0,0.015384615,0.0,0.010256411,0.046153847000000005,0.0,0.035897437000000004,0.0,0.08717949,0.19487179999999998,0.0,0.0,0.0051282053,0
awo0pu,three in one,13.0,0.0,12.0,nosleep,"i couldn't afford college so i took several jobs outside of high school. first i worked for a gas station for a year, which i enjoyed. i could sneak out beer out the back and not get in trouble. then i worked for a soda factory. which was pretty cool considering they could pay for my school once had i been there another few years. but there attendance policy was insane. i went to work with the stomach virus and they wouldn't let me go home. i had to quit working every twenty minutes either cause i had to shit or puke. they gave me hell about vomit on my uniform and my productivity being low. eventually i stormed out. 

i took a break when my sister died. she just turned 14 and hung herself. we had her stay at an asylum for a few years because she was determined clowns were out to get her and see seen them. it put so much stress on our family. my mom took up smoking and my dad began drinking jim beam more than usual. he got on disability after a forklift accident.

i took a job as a custodian for that mental institution. they knew me and they did do everything they could to help sis. i did spend a lot of time cleaning puke and poop.  poop was always smeared on the walls of rooms.

i definitely did see some horrific things. the worst thing i seen was an old woman chugging a fresh pot of coffee. it didn't even faze her. i've seen some cradle feces as it if were a baby. they gave me one rule and not to talk to a man at the end of the hall. his name was john.

johnny had a condition that he believed he was himself, satan, or a child at times. they showed me footage of him reading faulkner while sipping tea, him laughing in the floor playing with a ball, and he would sit there and wreck havoc. he convinced patients to kill themselves.

well i avoided him until recently. i was instructed to clean his room while he was strapped down. he wasn't allowed to see patients anymore for obvious reasons.

he had his eyes closed when i walked in and security followed me in. i cleaned up candy wrappers they snuck medicine in. cleaned the toilet. and set out a new pad to sleep on. security changed it later.

i turned around and he was sitting up. restraints off. he started talking like we probably would. security walked over 

""alright jon were going to leave now. no trouble needed.""

he stared in my eyes. ""the mind is a funny thing. when you think about your breathing, you have to make yourself breathe. when you think about your body moving, you have to make your body move. you can't think. same for blinking.""

""yeah that's strange ain't it.""

""your sisters mind was quite fun.""

my mouth dropped. according to his records he didn't get here until four years after her death.

""the clowns were real. and they know your name too. except they aren't clowns. some walk among us.""

no ico, no airdrop, and minimal pre-mine mean that this coin hasn’t circulated yet. and as of two weeks before the release of the main net, very little people know about this project.
the project itself is exciting and has huge amounts of potential, and there’s a good team backing it up.
these are perfect conditions for an extremely early adopter, and i’m ready to jump on mochimo when that main net comes out.

now, here’s what i want to know from you.
where do you think mochimo will go in the coming months into the coming years? what are your concerns? what makes you excited? what do you think the price and value of mochimo will be? do you think mochimo will make a big impact in the crypto space?",5378.0,4941.0,0.81,2018-06-18 11:28:29,stellarpasta,0.0,0.0,2.0,813.0,150.0,99,0,0.1589404,0.03311258,0.0,0.046357617000000004,0.0066225166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0397351,0.03311258,0.0,0.0,0.013245033,0.059602648,0.06622516,0.046357617000000004,0.0066225166,0.0,0.0,0.0794702,0.0,0.105960265,0.0,0.0,0.013245033,0.01986755,0.09271523,0.013245033,0.059602648,0.0066225166,0.0066225166,0.0066225166,0.06622516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0397351,0.0,0.18543047,0.0,0.57615894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03311258,0.0,0.0,0.0397351,0.0397351,0.08609272,0.0066225166,0.0,0.013245033,0.046357617000000004,0.01986755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013245033,0.0,0.046357617000000004,0.01986755,0.07284768,0.13245033,0.1589404,0.0066225166,0.17218544,0.0,0.03311258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052980132,0.07284768,0.0,0.0066225166,0.0,0.052980132,0.21192053,0.0,0.026490066,0.0397351,0
a6sn20,"full metal alchemist: brotherhood - 1st time watching, impressions (spoilers)",1.0,3.0,77.0,anime,"i know this show really doesn't need introduction here. i've been reading people saying this anime as a recommendation or whenever listing their top 10s.  i first started watching anime back in 2008 and albeit not being able to watch all shows, i've watched majority of them and enjoyed most of them. my friend recently let me in on his netflix account so i did some catching up. i finally tried watching fma and these are my thoughts.

the pilot episode was fast paced. i already knew who the main characters were so that made it easier. the opening theme got me hyped up hahaha. it had the same vibe as tokyo ghoul's unravel imo. it started kinda mysterious and melancholy but the music picks up and gives this sort of adrenaline for the episode to come.  so the first episode's plot is basically capturing this ice user who was a former military. i watched until episode 4 while writing this so i already know that they were called alchemist but it wasn't that obvious at the start. then the brothers came in plot happens and they come victorious at the end. a lot of characters were introduced, it was very systematic how each of them appeared. a lot of them were mysterious and the sort of villains also made an appearance at the end. i kinda didn't understand the whole mechanics of the show yet but it was able to tell me what era it might have been, the level of technology, and the basic politics. i think sword art online had a better pilot episode though because i like it when i already know the plot and where we're going with the story right at the get-go. the ending theme is good and kinda had a sad connotation to it, but the drawing is cool. episode 2 is what i will call more of the *real deal*. i finally know the story and entire plot of the show. the back story was pretty grounded and it made me sympathize with the two. the show cemented itself in my mind as an adventure kind of scenario where they find a way to bring back their bodies. this is how i understood the 2nd episode. the third episode is them looking for this philosoper's stone that was introduced at the 2nd episodes' intro (netflix let me skip it so i'm glad i didn't at first). they fought this priest who used a fake stone. two things stood out to me: first, they don't have a religion because they're scientists. i still don't know of they believe in god or not. second, this episode had a good life lesson at the end when talking with the desperate woman. another thing is that they finally introduced the ""main villains"" which are named lust and gluttony. i've watched enough nanatsu no taizai to know how many main villains there are. episode 4 is what really made me post about fma. this episode is dark, gonna tell that right out the bat. it's messed up to an emotional level not really graphic or anything. it also introduced scar face who can basically kill people when he touches their face. i'm guessing he's an alchemist, too, because bradley (the military's leader)said he's a traitor. for the plot of this episode, i'm gonna quote mustang (fire guy), ""this case is evil."" i do love dogs and have a sweet spot for children so i was miffed. i'm glad the buildup was only a couple minutes long so i didn't get emotionally attached.

the show is, up to this point, a ride. it has a cult following and people always hype it up that's why i tried it with high expectations. my favorite genre is romance so i already made ships like the fire guy with his secretary and maybe edward elric with his blonde childhood friend. i really can't say if this already deserve a high rating on mal, i mean i never judge an anime by how other people rate it (although i watched your name because it was all the talk as a romantic movie) nor will i judge after 4 episodes like a sicko. fma's genre fits my tastes so i don't think i'll drop it. i know it has like 50 episodes so i'll save my verdict till i finish it.

tldr: started fast, op theme is fire, 2nd episode is what really hooks you in, has good bgms, animation is pretty smooth, 4th episode is dark af.

awscvv,haha my nmom who hasn't spoken to her sister in many months got her to speak to me on the phone about me being jobless.,1.0,1.0,119.0,raisedbynarcissists,"my aunty was not prepared to listen and i frankly don't tolerate that kind of shit for anyone. 

&#x200b;

what is more ironic is my nmom goes mental and forbids me to work if the job title is not up to her par haha. 

&#x200b;

eh but why did it get this bad? long story.

&#x200b;

specifically emotional abuse and now i have seen i was raped too but this was deeply suppressed. 

&#x200b;

it begins with childhood trauma, owning up to the fact that the last 20 years of seeing psychologists did jack shit. my 9 - 10 years of being on antidepressants which i struggle to get off fucken destroyed me and made me the lazy no good person i am today.

&#x200b;

however all of this could have of been avoided if the specialists were doing their fucken jobs. in the end i had adhd !!!!

&#x200b;

once i got the proper medication my parents fucken denied me from having as a child when the teachers made it known to them a few times there were behavioural issues with me i was able to unfuck myself !!!!

&#x200b;

i have been deeply self analysing myself and it has done wonders. my bipolar diagnosis and being told i have depression from a young age could be anything as far as i am concerned now as it is maybe learnt behaviour from a nut case narcisstic mom who decided to take on what her father started which was some deep abuse on anyone who is close. 

&#x200b;

every time i do something challenging and against something these psychs would say i get a piece of the picture or puzzle i had been longing for. 

&#x200b;

now that everything is documented too and is all on the table for my own eyes to see i can make sense of it properly as oppopsed to going to psychs and just yapping for 40 minutes then waiting a fortnight to yap again. this was never going to resolve shit for me.

&#x200b;

i have been able to access a lot of my repressed memories as i have began unpeeling layers of me. 

&#x200b;

i just want to own these memories and for them to be in front of me so that i can evaluate these incidents that have bothered me now as a grown adult at 34 and not 8 - \`10 when i was a child and maybe misinterpreted it etc...

&#x200b;

once i own all of this i can then bury it and never need to explore this past ever again.   


it also means all of this stress is lifted.

&#x200b;

further what is interesting is despite going to psychologists there was always going to be more i can admit to my ownself then to others. as it is there to protect me. how many years would i need to go to psychs to get to the bottom of this?  


$50,000 down the drain :(

&#x200b;

now my conscience is clear as fucken day light and i own me !!!

&#x200b;

as for the job i could get one whenever but this personal issue of mine is something i keep on dragging and needed to get to the bottom of so that i don't let it influence me ever again and so that i acknowledge that it is now in the past and i did everything i could with it and should be proud as i didn't hide from myself.

aczc7s,parking meter exploit,0.0,24.0,21.0,vancouver,"i have a theory. so i’ll run it by you guys so you can poke holes in it.

i’ve noticed a massive uptick in the last few years of broken parking meters in the downtown area. i always assumed it was jammed with a coin or garbage.

the other day, before i put money in the meter, there was already something obstructing the slot. it was a straw, bent in half. and then i saw the one beside my meter was also jammed. 

and then it occurred to me, this is a really easy way of getting money.

say someone jams the meter so that the coin goes into the slot, but doesn’t drop beyond the trap door. it just sits in the slot, but just out of reach. now imagine there was a way to get that coin out. magnets, duct tape, gum, glue. 

do you think someone is tampering with the meter to get the coin to stop in the slot, so they can fish out the coin? has anyone else suspected this, or can anyone confirm they’ve seen cut and bent straws jamming the meter?",2904.0,6644.0,0.53,2019-01-06 00:56:02,NotAlsoShabby,0.0,0.0,3.0,945.0,188.0,116,0,0.15425532,0.021276595,0.0,0.05851064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06382979,0.010638298000000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026595745,0.069148935,0.010638298000000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11702128,0.0,0.09042553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0053191490000000004,0.10106383,0.0053191490000000004,0.07446808,0.0,0.03723404,0.0,0.026595745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015957447,0.05319149,0.09574468400000001,0.0053191490000000004,0.5851064,0.0,0.0053191490000000004,0.0053191490000000004,0.04255319,0.0,0.0,0.026595745,0.0,0.08510638,0.0,0.0053191490000000004,0.03723404,0.021276595,0.0053191490000000004,0.0053191490000000004,0.0,0.0,0.010638298000000001,0.015957447,0.0053191490000000004,0.0053191490000000004,0.069148935,0.12765957,0.15425532,0.0053191490000000004,0.2287234,0.0,0.015957447,0.0053191490000000004,0.0,0.010638298000000001,0.0,0.0,0.05851064,0.15425532,0.0,0.047872342000000005,0.010638298000000001,0.05319149,0.13829787,0.0,0.0,0.015957447,0

long story short, i am a straight, cis-gender female and i try as hard as i can to be a good ally to the lgbtq+ communities. i was talking to a friend of mine about how we wish there were more young adult literature for lgbtq+ youth (similar to books like simon vs. the homosapien's agenda), and my friend suggested i write one, as i write all the time for fun. i thought this was a great idea, but i wanted to make sure i got as many opinions as possible from lgbtq+ individuals to ensure that i am not overstepping anything, speaking over people, etc. 

in that light, my friend and i created a survey that i am using to attempt to make sure my information is correct. i have posted the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlsfn1rqkxqr1vj5zbbpvufxki87gg7t-o71ip5yfulfraz9daq/viewform?usp=sf_link) \- i am really sorry if this kind of post is not welcome here, but i love reddit and have been able to get a wide range of viewpoints from people on here for my work before, and so i was hoping that some of you would be interested in taking this survey.

70azz1,uk ticket competition scam?,32.0,13.0,27.0,Metal,"i couldn't think of a better word for it than scam, it's not so much a scam but a little sneaky. 

last month, i entered a competition for a metal festival in birmingham that had alestorm headlining. didn't think too much about it, just entered on facebook. alestorm is my sisters favourite band, and i don't really like them. 

anyway, i won tickets! i looked into it, 6 tickets apparently, i'd never won anything in my life. i was shaking a little (yeah go on laugh at me, i feel silly anyway). so i look a little more and they want £10 a ticket booking fee. okay, i wasn't planning on spending £60 but i already told my sister i'd won and my parents wanted to go too. so i booked it. i mean, i never win anything and the fact that i won made it feel like i should appreciate it and just go. 

since then, i've seen about 20 different people post about winning the competition, and they keep deleting and renewing the facebook ad every time it gets so many comments. 

i feel quite duped. i looked into the tickets and the prices are only £40 for tickets with the fee. i impulse purchased because i felt i had won something. 

i don't know, are they literally selecting everyone who entered? has anyone else 'won'? is this something that everyone knows about except me? what is going on with this?

edit: if i lived nearby i would probably just go and not think too much of it, but we live 100 miles away and it's going to cost a fair bit for accommodation. they offered some ""vip"" rooms for ""reduced prices"" in the winner e-mail.

96klqa,if you could pick anyone from tv or movies to be your real mom or dad who would you pick?,3.0,32.0,89.0,CasualConversation,"i love asking people this as this makes for interesting conversation. plus right now i'm bored and have nothing to do so i thought this would be a fun question to ask here... so who from tv or movies would you pick to be your real mom or dad if you could and why do you pick them? they can be anyone they don't have to play a parent on tv to count so even if it's someone from a reality show it counts. they don't have to be a parent in real life either to count. you don't have to pick out both a mom or a dad just a dad or just a mom counts. 

i would personally pick randy fenoli from the reality show say yes to the dress to be my dad if i could. he's just such a sweetheart plus i'm a huge fan of his cute little dog chewy. he's not a parent in real life but i think he would make a great dad. he's very kind and has a great sense of humor plus i think he would be great when it came to giving advice or wisdom about anything especially weddings. plus he would accept the fact that i'm a lesbian which would be a big plus.

70azz1,uk ticket competition scam?,32.0,13.0,27.0,Metal,"i couldn't think of a better word for it than scam, it's not so much a scam but a little sneaky. 

last month, i entered a competition for a metal festival in birmingham that had alestorm headlining. didn't think too much about it, just entered on facebook. alestorm is my sisters favourite band, and i don't really like them. 

anyway, i won tickets! i looked into it, 6 tickets apparently, i'd never won anything in my life. i was shaking a little (yeah go on laugh at me, i feel silly anyway). so i look a little more and they want £10 a ticket booking fee. okay, i wasn't planning on spending £60 but i already told my sister i'd won and my parents wanted to go too. so i booked it. i mean, i never win anything and the fact that i won made it feel like i should appreciate it and just go. 

since then, i've seen about 20 different people post about winning the competition, and they keep deleting and renewing the facebook ad every time it gets so many comments. 

i feel quite duped. i looked into the tickets and the prices are only £40 for tickets with the fee. i impulse purchased because i felt i had won something. 

i don't know, are they literally selecting everyone who entered? has anyone else 'won'? is this something that everyone knows about except me? what is going on with this?

edit: if i lived nearby i would probably just go and not think too much of it, but we live 100 miles away and it's going to cost a fair bit for accommodation. they offered some ""vip"" rooms for ""reduced prices"" in the winner e-mail.

adpilo,mother maple,39.0,4.0,12.0,nosleep,"mother maple has been around me for as long as i can remember.

my mom told me that no one else can see her besides her and me. mother maple couldn't talk and was going to be like another parent i guess. it was just me and my mom. my dad was never in the picture. 

mother maple was there when i slept, when i had birthday parties, when i had baseball games, when i graduated from lsu, when i got my dream job as an accountant, and even when i got married.

with age i realized not to show her too much attention so kids wouldn't think i was weird. i never even told my wife that maple sat on the front pew at our wedding.

she had such smooth brown skin, gray hair, a very kind smile. she usually wore a red plaid dress and a white apron with a few stains.

she may have never talked but the way she would look at me knew if i was doing good. like, the time in middle school me and my friends looked at a playboy magazine. she gave me a very disgusted look at night when i laid down.

i often questioned if mother maple would be in my children's life. obviously they would bring it up to their mom. me and mom would talk about her often. she was around my mom as a girl too. once she had me, mother maple was with me more. even though my mom could still see her. sadly, my wife can't have kids. and adoption was too expensive

she was there when my mom died. i never thought my moms death would be because a bullet went through her skull. 

i guess between the stress of all this i started drinking heavily. i lost my job. they found out i was mixing coffee and whiskey. i didn't really get that drunk at work which is weird

i told my wife about her. my wife must have thought i was crazy. it does sound weird that a woman follows me around. being there when i was taking exams in class, when i was hiking, when we were on our honeymoon, and even when i got fired. my wife suggested i quit drinking. she was gonna go stay the weekend with her family while i sorted through my problems. which isn't healthy for a marriage but i understood.

i shouted out to mother maple that i hated her. i wanted her to leave. 

around the time i finished jugging a fifth of some really cheap tequila. i started to smell something rotten. it smelled like raw meat that has sat in the sun. i look up and it's mother maple.

she was usually ten feet away from me at most. but now she was three feet away. she was naked this time. her ole southern belle dress was gone. she was the smell i noticed. her beautiful eyes didn't have the brown in them that used to be there. only white. what's worse is blood is pouring down them.  she follows every step i take. i even tried running and she runs too.

my wife doesn't smell anything and she doesn't see anything. she's even stepped in the blood puddles. she decided to move out.

i don't know if i hurt maple. or what i can do to fix it. i've apologized a dozen times. but i'm sorry mother maple.

i have a feeling this had something to do with my mom's suicide.

ah4gdd,tipping culture needs to be abolished.,9.0,17.0,38.0,unpopularopinion,"while tipping certainly isn't mandatory, it's definitely something that is expected whenever you go out somewhere to eat or drink. i understand that some waiters/waitresses make like $2 per hour depending on where you're from, but that doesn't mean you're obligated to throw them extra money for a job they chose when they could have applied to any fast-food joint and gotten paid the full minimum wage. where i live, waiters get paid the full wage, yet tipping is still expected because...well, i dunno. i hear the argument ''they provided you with a service, why not help them out?'' being thrown around a lot which i think is the most ludicrous argument that is uttered from only the most sanctimonious people, or just people with herd-mentality who do what is socially expected of them without question. 

i just want to ask these people...do you tip the cashier you scanned and bagged all your items and completed your transaction? she provided you with a service. do you tip the retail associate who assisted you with finding the product you were looking for? do you leave a tip for the fast-food worker who prepared your order? all of these people are living off of minimum wage and nobody expects them to be tipped. what separates these workers from waiters/waitresses, or hosts/hostesses? these jobs aren't any more laborious than the ones i listed above. there's nothing laborious about greeting you at the door, guiding you to the bathrooms, booking reservations, or serving to you food/drinks. 

if tipping waiters and hosts is considered a must, then i sure as hell hope you're also tipping the cashier at walmart who bagged your items or the mcdonald's worker who made your coffee, fries, and big mac. once tipping is considered a must-do, and you're regarded as a monster if you choose not to partake, tipping culture is no longer an act of kindness but rather pity charity work. people won't bat an eye if you walk by a homeless person without tossing him a couple dollars but will put you on par with satan if you choose not to leave a tip.

9i3bqf,one week check-in,2.0,1.0,17.0,NoFap,"it's been a long time (or at least it feels that way) since i've made it to day seven on hard mode. let me tell you some of the awesome things that happened to me this week! and as a preface, know that i'm in nofap for the confidence and the socialization, not romantic goals, which should show a bit more as to why i'm so excited about this past week. 

&#x200b;

\-finally found a friend at college, we're platonic, she's easy to talk to, puts as much genuine effort into listening and caring about what i have to say as i do for her, it's so great to have people to talk to again.

\-i ran 3.5 miles without stopping in my jogging class.

\-i was invited, and joined a dnd group where we all seem to actually care about the game and respecting each other's spotlight and just having fun with chill people.

\-i found an picked up a book by my new favorite author at the library and am eating it up!

&#x200b;

i know that none of these events are necessarily linked through causation to nofap, but spending your time doing other stuff and keeping your mind clear of junk really does help with confidence and drive. cheers everyone! hope you're all having a great day!

antdzo,"it took me over a year to get my 1st job, all because no one told me about availability",1.0,0.0,87.0,TrueOffMyChest,"i'm just reminiscing...it's been years since then, but i'll never forget the level of stress i had. i just wanted to work in retail, but no matter how many times i filled out applications i was always denied. i put down all different slots of hours, looked up exact shift times, asked and googled for tips on how to get hired. but people rarely mentioned availability.

so i eventually found tips online about open availability. i had thought that i could never have that since i needed other ppl to drive me. it was impossible to work random hours. 

i finally, finally found one day a thread about how you can have open availability but then still tell the manager your preference for shifts. 

so you can technically work 24/7, but if your preference is for the midshift, then you'll only be scheduled for midshift 90% of the time. the other 10% of the time, you'll just cover any shift people call out of or that the manager desperately needs filled.

and that's exactly what happened to me. i worked midshift, and only closed or opened once every few weeks. i felt like i was in a dream.

i had filled out dozens of applications for no reason at all. none of them had open availability. i didn't know. when i found out the truth, i filled out only 10 applications, had 2 interviews at different stores, and finally got hired.

so it ended well. but i wasted so much of my time, and i had thought i was just a failure or that the economy was terrible. my parents even told me that. but the truth was that i just didn't know the rules.",203.0,1950.0,0.6,2019-02-06 19:54:15,VisionGoku1,0.0,0.0,19.0,1538.0,285.0,159,0,0.16724738,0.027874565,0.0,0.045296166,0.0,0.0,0.010452962,0.0,0.08362369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017421603,0.020905923,0.09756097,0.024390243,0.0034843206,0.0,0.006968640999999999,0.048780486,0.0,0.09756097,0.0,0.0,0.020905923,0.034843206,0.17421603,0.010452962,0.094076656,0.0,0.05923345,0.027874565,0.05574913,0.0034843206,0.0034843206,0.0,0.0,0.024390243,0.11149826,0.07317073,0.0,0.5818814999999999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09756097,0.006968640999999999,0.0,0.038327526,0.017421603,0.045296166,0.0034843206,0.0,0.010452962,0.006968640999999999,0.024390243,0.013937281999999999,0.0034843206,0.0034843206,0.031358887,0.006968640999999999,0.010452962,0.031358887,0.12195122,0.12195122,0.16724738,0.027874565,0.18118466,0.0,0.006968640999999999,0.0034843206,0.0034843206,0.0034843206,0.0,0.0,0.05923345,0.07665505,0.0,0.020905923,0.0034843206,0.09756097,0.19163764,0.0,0.05574913,0.020905923,0

in my world there are two dwarven kingdoms residing on opposite mountain ranges in an east to west spectrum of the continent. the two kingdoms are incredibly similar in culture excepting the language. the eastern dwarves worship the lighting god dalagog, but the western dwarves are a blank slate.

so my question is this: how could there be two separate kingdoms of very similar cultures on opposite ends of the continent? what caused them to divide? do the western dwarves serve a different deity? was there a cultural rift? give me your ideas!

a78t51,i (m25) was just threatened by my gf's (f20) dad (m56) because he doesnt want me to see her,6.0,7.0,91.0,relationships,"my gf and i have been going out for almost a year. she is a college gymnast and student, and i work full time and am a student. she is black and i am white. 

she was a virgin, never done drugs or even drank and was very sheltered. she is really cool and fun and you wouldn't think she was sheltered, but because of how her father is and she went to a small private high school she didnt make many friends. i was the opposite. at the age of 16 i went from being an athlete to partying. i got into alcohol, and then drugs. by 17 i was a heroin addict. i used til i was 19. i went to treatment several times then got clean after i moved away. from there i got my life back i together. i stayed sober for a year before i started working and then i got my ged. i then got a better job working in medical manufacturing. it inspired me to go to school to become an engineer. math has always come easy to me and i loved the environment so i decided to pursue it. for the last three years i have been in school and am now at a university close to getting my bachelors done with. i am still with the manufacturing company because they treat me really well, work with my schedule and have given me a special position where i make really good money while i'm in school....

so i haven't drank or done drugs in over 6 years, have a great job, am almost done with school and for the last year i have been living very healthy and go to the gym almost daily....

her father is one of those really religious crazy parents and a crazy athlete parent. he has told her she cant date until shes done with medical school. she still lives at home because it's next to the university. she cant work because of her busy and demanding schedule with gymnastics and school, so she relies on her parents for money and stuff. i try to help her but she won't let me...

because of how her father is and because hes threatened her from dating she had to keep me a secret. her mother, sister(older doesnt live at home), brother(older doesnt live at home) and all her friends know about me though. her father has physically hurt her multiple times and she believes hes bipolar. he can go from a good dad to a violent asshole in a second. 

my gf and i are completely in love and everything was going amazing. her family supported us and everyone thought it was time to tell her father that she liked someone. 

she told her father several nights ago and he was happy for her. i was shook. he said he wanted to meet me and all that stuff. her mom has been supportive the whole time and was telling him how i seem like a good man. it was a huge relief that he now knew and accepted....

the next morning i wake up to multiple texts from my gf. basically he completely flipped the switch. a couple months ago my gfs sister did a background check and saw that i had a paraphernalia charge from 2011 on my record. the night my gf told her dad about us, she told her sister that she told her dad. i guess her sister, who acted like she supported us, called her dad and told him i was a ""druggy"". this is what caused her father to go insane. 

the whole family started fighting. her father went after my gf because she was defending me. her mom had to get between them so he didnt hurt her. my gf explained how it was something from my past and i am completely different now, but he didnt care. ge then started saying all these things he didnt like about me, and forbid her to see me... we are in love and she cant just stop seeing me. all we wanted was for him to give me the chance to meet him and then make up his decision. he said he would never meet me because i am never going to be a part of his family. he started calling me a perverted drug addict and demanded she told me to get lost. 

oh and he was also saying that because i was good looking that i wasn't actually a virgin. before i met my gf i was. up til i was 19 i had chances but never went through with them because when i was younger(12) an older girl pressured me into doing sexual stuff, and ever since then i had a horrible feeling of guilt every time i was about to have sex so i always backed out. which i'm glad of now. my gf was the first woman i didnt get this feeling with. we waited a few months before we had sex, but when we did i didnt get that feeling. i think it's because we are in love? anyway, he kept saying i was lying about that. he was attacking my character in every way.... he was also saying he would blow my head off if i didnt leave her alone. 

yesterday they kept fighting about it. i was on the phone with my gf and heard what her mom said:

mom: ""after what we learned yesterday i cant believe you feel the same:

gf: "" you cant judge someone based on stuff that happened more than 6 years ago. i fell in love with who he is now""

mom: ""oh yes you can. i thought you had higher standards""

gf: ""really mom? thanks! hes perfect now and you guys won't even give him a chance....""

it actually hurt hearing her mom say that. i had just bought her a couple christmas gifts the other day and was excited to give them to her. but my gf says those weren't her words and that her mom was also scared of her dad. 

just an hour ago my phone rang and it was my gfs house. i picked it up and said hello. it was her dad. he told me if i didnt leave her alone that her brothers would come after me, then just hung up. 

now idk what to do? i feel so bad for my gf because she has dealt with him her whole life and now she has to deal with this because of me. but we are so in love and we make eachother better. we want to be together forever. the plan was she would move in next fall, but now her father is saying i will never be a part of his family and he wants her to never talk to me. she is saying he doesnt matter and it's his loss if he doesnt want anything to do with her. she says we will always be together and if she loses her family because they won't even give me a chance than that's their loss.

i feel terrible. she has told me how her dad is but i always reminded her that it is her dad and i want them to have a good relationship. i told her we should live closer to her family because i want her to remain close to them, but now they want nothing to do with me. i just wish they knew how much i loved her and how i would never hurt her or do anything bad to her. i wish they could see me how i am now, but they won't give me a chance...

what should i do?

tl;dr my gfs father threatened me because he found out i did drugs when i was younger. even though i've been sober over 6 years he told my gf she cant see me. she told him she wouldn't stop and he went after her and threatened to blow my head off. he then called me tonight and threatened sending her brothers after me if i didnt leave her alone.

so this story might be a little bec, but it was so frustrating and a little sexist, so i'm gonna tell it anyway.

i have resting bitch face. if you're not familiar: this means that your natural, relaxed face looks in some way negative. like you're permanently angry or sad or whatever. my rbf looks like ""angela merkel is *so* done with your shit"". like ""i might be on my period, or i might have a handgrenade in my purse, you won't know which until it's too late"". like ""either we just ran out of chocolate or we ran out of room to bury all the bodies"". you get the gist. it's a little sad with a little bored and a little potential serial killer. i can't help it, it's just mah face!

i get my rbf from my spermdonor, mr einstein. so does yb, though he looks a little more ""eugene levy had a psychotic break and is coming to murder you"" than ""angela merkel"". so you'd think, with all the rbf going around in the family, that this would be a well understood fenomenon. unfortunately for me, the other rbf sufferers were male, and sexism is a thing. so them looking like potential serial killers: ok. me looking like a potential serial killer: not ok.

this resulted in the following interaction being had approximately 8 billion times:

op: \*reading or something\*

fam out of the blue: 'are you grumpy again?'

op: 'i'm not grumpy.'

fam: 'you *look* grumpy!'

op: 'i'm *not* grumpy!'

fam: 'see, you're overreacting, you *are* grumpy'

op: \*head explodes\*

**parenting tip:** if you are *actually* interested in what is bothering your child, this is *not* the way to find out.

to this day there are very, very few things that can make me want to spontaneously develop deadly laser eyes like the sentence *are you grumpy again*. this behavior became especially annoying when yb and ys were old enough to join in, and i started hearing this pretty much every single day. in 21 years (until i went nc) they never got the message that it was just. my. face.",16272.0,1525.0,0.95,2018-11-18 23:33:05,JCXIII-R,0.0,0.0,6.0,2352.0,387.0,241,0,0.42117646,0.06823529,0.030588236,0.04235294,0.007058823499999999,0.007058823499999999,0.16705883,0.009411764,0.06352941,0.002352941,0.023529412000000003,0.0,0.007058823499999999,0.030588236,0.07058824,0.06352941,0.030588236,0.023529412000000003,0.002352941,0.056470587999999995,0.004705882,0.10117647,0.02117647,0.018823529,0.004705882,0.016470589,0.10823529,0.025882352,0.075294115,0.011764706000000002,0.044705882999999995,0.009411764,0.05882353,0.014117646999999999,0.0,0.002352941,0.002352941,0.023529412000000003,0.037647057000000005,0.11058824,0.0,0.52235293,0.0,0.002352941,0.004705882,0.051764704,0.054117646,0.002352941,0.014117646999999999,0.009411764,0.06352941,0.011764706000000002,0.018823529,0.0,0.018823529,0.023529412000000003,0.037647057000000005,0.03529412,0.007058823499999999,0.011764706000000002,0.023529412000000003,0.025882352,0.016470589,0.105882354,0.09176469999999999,0.16941176,0.023529412000000003,0.12235294,0.0,0.007058823499999999,0.0,0.007058823499999999,0.02117647,0.0,0.007058823499999999,0.10823529,0.051764704,0.004705882,0.04,0.004705882,0.049411765999999996,0.17882353,0.007058823499999999,0.002352941,0.03529412,0

the closet mentality

being transgender or being gay goes more different than say racial or even opression of religious minorities. lgbt folks on the other hand is not just something so easy to work on, how can someone figure out your sexuality that easily in the first place? i think is more about social stigmatization(and i am talking mostly in the western world of course). i mean there is no slavery, there is no anti lgbt cop tirade, there is no affect of how your sexuality can also affect your entry to college as well.

a similar situation with my group as well(autistic people), we don’t experience opression. just a bit of social stigmatization and i am speaking from experience. but there is no “neurotypical” hate group out there to get me, is there? i have read that autistic people are of course more times than neurotypical counterparts to be victims of assault, bullying and even sexual harassment. but those are just stats. lgbt opression can more or so along the line of us. again, not trying to be a dick so i am sorry if this taken wrong.",368.0,1962.0,0.63,2018-04-26 04:45:49,Luciano700,0.0,0.0,13.0,1157.0,206.0,128,0,0.1298077,0.009615385,0.0,0.03846154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01923077,0.043269232000000005,0.009615385,0.009615385,0.0,0.01923077,0.072115384,0.115384616,0.04807692400000001,0.028846154,0.014423077,0.0,0.04807692400000001,0.0,0.11057692,0.028846154,0.009615385,0.01923077,0.0,0.1298077,0.04807692400000001,0.08653846400000001,0.0,0.0625,0.0048076925,0.08173077,0.0048076925,0.0048076925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009615385,0.14903846,0.0,0.58653843,0.0,0.014423077,0.0048076925,0.04807692400000001,0.014423077,0.0,0.024038462000000003,0.009615385,0.03846154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0048076925,0.033653848,0.028846154,0.0,0.009615385,0.0048076925,0.028846154,0.01923077,0.01923077,0.072115384,0.1298077,0.11057692,0.033653848,0.067307696,0.0048076925,0.009615385,0.0048076925,0.0048076925,0.0,0.024038462000000003,0.0,0.08173077,0.043269232000000005,0.0048076925,0.043269232000000005,0.0,0.01923077,0.17788461,0.009615385,0.024038462000000003,0.014423077,0

sure the hardships and marginalization are hard to spot directly at first, and don't assume either that people with higher functioning autism have easier too. that's only if you can practice so much self-control within yourself, otherwise you are still as likely to face a lot of hardship and bullying...

come on now, do you really just assume that we all got it easy going on? nobody really gives 2 shits about us, not even the so called sjws are batting an eye out on us anytime soon. stop assuming that autistic people got it easy going when you never stepped into their shoes, because even animals and the morbidly obese are getting way more attention than us.",368.0,1962.0,0.66,2018-12-08 21:55:45,Luciano700,0.0,0.0,19.0,1191.0,151.0,115,0,0.35714287,0.00952381,0.0,0.023809524,0.14761905,0.0,0.071428575,0.0,0.07619048,0.028571429,0.0,0.0,0.00952381,0.04761905,0.0952381,0.03809524,0.01904762,0.00952381,0.0,0.03809524,0.0,0.061904762,0.033333335,0.028571429,0.01904762,0.023809524,0.12857144,0.028571429,0.061904762,0.0,0.03809524,0.00952381,0.06666667,0.004761905,0.00952381,0.004761905,0.0,0.023809524,0.01904762,0.07619048,0.0,0.41904762,0.004761905,0.004761905,0.004761905,0.004761905,0.01904762,0.004761905,0.023809524,0.00952381,0.033333335,0.004761905,0.014285714,0.0,0.01904762,0.023809524,0.00952381,0.014285714,0.0,0.01904762,0.01904762,0.028571429,0.01904762,0.061904762,0.09047619,0.0952381,0.028571429,0.13809524,0.0,0.014285714,0.004761905,0.0,0.004761905,0.0,0.0,0.123809524,0.061904762,0.004761905,0.04285714400000001,0.004761905,0.057142857000000005,0.10952381,0.01904762,0.014285714,0.033333335,0
afltq1,tips for trimming nails?,41.0,3.0,24.0,Hedgehog,"pretty much just this question. my buddy loki isn’t very fond of me clipping his nails and i usually try to incorporate it into bath time (aka two birds with one stone), however recently he’s been starting to become extra hard to work with and doesn’t hold still. 

i was wondering if anyone has tips to make it easier? it has to be done either way, but i’d much prefer it to be as stress free as possible for him.

no jitters or anything, just calm. 

the only thing i need to break is the routine to go outside and have a cigarette and even when i take one there is no effect at all that i require.

theanine is what they should advertise for smokers to quit because this actually works.


edit: i guess i'm the only one since im beeing downvoted. works for me atleast. 
i crave it so much less with 400mg of theanine. if nothing else it's a good way to cut down and evetually quit.",334.0,513.0,0.54,2017-07-19 15:31:54,redditsmma,0.0,0.0,6.0,525.0,98.0,78,0,0.12244898,0.020408163,0.010204081,0.010204081,0.0,0.010204081,0.0,0.0,0.071428575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040816326,0.020408163,0.10204082,0.030612245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05102041,0.0,0.091836736,0.030612245,0.0,0.030612245,0.030612245,0.14285715,0.010204081,0.08163265,0.0,0.040816326,0.030612245,0.08163265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010204081,0.15306123,0.0,0.6122449000000001,0.020408163,0.0,0.0,0.091836736,0.0,0.020408163,0.010204081,0.020408163,0.071428575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020408163,0.030612245,0.010204081,0.0,0.0,0.020408163,0.0,0.020408163,0.010204081,0.10204082,0.13265306,0.1734694,0.030612245,0.091836736,0.0,0.030612245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010204081,0.040816326,0.0,0.040816326,0.010204081,0.020408163,0.19387755,0.0,0.040816326,0.0,0

the project itself is exciting and has huge amounts of potential, and there’s a good team backing it up.
these are perfect conditions for an extremely early adopter, and i’m ready to jump on mochimo when that main net comes out.

now, here’s what i want to know from you.

i love the enthusiasm of this team and the positive attitude. like they are genuinely excited about what they are discussing. it helps keep the listeners excited about it too. 

i feel like they discuss the story more too. obviously it's hard to discuss everything that happens, but they do a great job covering the whole story. 

i obviously love the other team too, i am just very pleased with these guys. i think you should keep it like this, but have the full team for cosmere episodes. because honestly the cosmere is this podcasts bread and butter. so have an all star team(craig, ryan, todd, megan and ken) for the cosmere, and two teams for other series like you are doing now.

836m2a,[help!] how can i help my autistic cousin?,7.0,8.0,42.0,autism,"hello there! i'm currently babysitting my aunts child with mild autism. i was wondering what we can do in general to help him become more and more functional so it's no too late to reduce some of the less functional habits.

right now, he usually eats frozen pizza only except for a serving oatmeal in the morning, which we put all kinds of vitamins in to compensate. his day usually consists of watching english cartoons even though we live in sweden. he's a kind of happy and lovely kid that's joyful and can speak to a degree but i'm always scared that there are things that we can help him with right now that might not be possible in the future. i'm asking you all here if you know anything that has increased the functionality of your or if there's any proven diet/way to help him. i'll just ask some questions but please try to help aswell, we just want his best.

should i find a way to feed him another diet? if so, how? is there any ""meta"" diet for autism?

should i try to talk to him a lot to help him develop his language?

should i teach him basic morals and ethics that he won't understand is wrong?

should i give him another medium to spend his time with so he can develop himself more? examples: games/puzzles that can  benefit him?

ak54cy,"oneplus 6, huawei honor v20, or another phone?",1.0,2.0,46.0,PickAnAndroidForMe,"\[uk\]

i currently have a galaxy s7 which i got september 2017.  a few months ago, i've been having problems with the charging, it only charges in specific positions and is getting slower with time.

i believe it's time for an upgrade as i have saved up a bit and am currently looking at mid-range phones. i have my eyes set on the oneplus6 (£399) and the honor v20 (£499). the most important feature i am looking for are good battery life, nice camera and dual-sim option. i'm  more inclined for the honor v20 as i quite like the camera punch hole.

my budget is around £500 though i probably could go up a bit but only if really needed.

any recommendations? maybe another phone which is similar to these devices (bonus points if it's cheaper)?",223.0,564.0,1.0,2019-01-26 23:12:34,Brit_in_Lux,0.0,0.0,8.0,747.0,136.0,97,0,0.20289855,0.028985507999999997,0.0,0.02173913,0.014492753999999998,0.0,0.028985507999999997,0.04347826,0.050724637,0.014492753999999998,0.0,0.0,0.02173913,0.072463766,0.050724637,0.050724637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07971015,0.0,0.11594203,0.014492753999999998,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.11594203,0.05797101599999999,0.072463766,0.0,0.036231883,0.036231883,0.07971015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028985507999999997,0.123188406,0.0,0.5072464,0.007246376999999999,0.014492753999999998,0.0,0.08695652,0.0,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.014492753999999998,0.050724637,0.0,0.0,0.02173913,0.014492753999999998,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.0,0.028985507999999997,0.036231883,0.04347826,0.04347826,0.08695652,0.10869565,0.13768116,0.050724637,0.13043478,0.0,0.028985507999999997,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.02173913,0.0,0.0,0.02173913,0.06521739,0.0,0.05797101599999999,0.0,0.05797101599999999,0.17391305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

i’ll give a brief version:

-lady speaks at the un regarding climate change
-the un pledges 3 billion to fight climate change
conclusion drawn was that
-the lady speaking caused the un to donate 3 billion dollars.

my argument is that the un didn’t hear this lady talk and then got together after for drinks and said “geee she’s got a point. okay, 3 billion!”

they had already planned to do so.

anyway, that’s neither here nor there. what, if any, is the fallacy called where the result was not due to the stated premises? other than just being invalid.",2903.0,6644.0,0.5,2019-03-04 19:38:13,NotAlsoShabby,0.0,0.0,3.0,708.0,127.0,93,0,0.19685039,0.031496063,0.007874016,0.05511811,0.023622047,0.007874016,0.0,0.0,0.047244094,0.007874016,0.015748031000000003,0.0,0.007874016,0.023622047,0.062992126,0.031496063,0.023622047,0.023622047,0.0,0.11023622,0.007874016,0.11811024,0.007874016,0.0,0.062992126,0.007874016,0.1496063,0.023622047,0.047244094,0.0,0.062992126,0.007874016,0.062992126,0.0,0.0,0.031496063,0.007874016,0.015748031000000003,0.09448819,0.09448819,0.0,0.54330707,0.0,0.031496063,0.0,0.031496063,0.015748031000000003,0.007874016,0.015748031000000003,0.031496063,0.062992126,0.007874016,0.0,0.015748031000000003,0.023622047,0.031496063,0.023622047,0.0,0.0,0.047244094,0.031496063,0.007874016,0.007874016,0.047244094,0.11023622,0.11023622,0.007874016,0.12598425,0.0,0.023622047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007874016,0.14173229,0.062992126,0.0,0.015748031000000003,0.007874016,0.047244094,0.19685039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

awscvv,haha my nmom who hasn't spoken to her sister in many months got her to speak to me on the phone about me being jobless.,1.0,1.0,119.0,raisedbynarcissists,"my aunty was not prepared to listen and i frankly don't tolerate that kind of shit for anyone. 

&#x200b;

what is more ironic is my nmom goes mental and forbids me to work if the job title is not up to her par haha. 

&#x200b;

eh but why did it get this bad? long story.

&#x200b;

specifically emotional abuse and now i have seen i was raped too but this was deeply suppressed. 

&#x200b;

it begins with childhood trauma, owning up to the fact that the last 20 years of seeing psychologists did jack shit. my 9 - 10 years of being on antidepressants which i struggle to get off fucken destroyed me and made me the lazy no good person i am today.

&#x200b;

however all of this could have of been avoided if the specialists were doing their fucken jobs. in the end i had adhd !!!!

&#x200b;

once i got the proper medication my parents fucken denied me from having as a child when the teachers made it known to them a few times there were behavioural issues with me i was able to unfuck myself !!!!

&#x200b;

i have been deeply self analysing myself and it has done wonders. my bipolar diagnosis and being told i have depression from a young age could be anything as far as i am concerned now as it is maybe learnt behaviour from a nut case narcisstic mom who decided to take on what her father started which was some deep abuse on anyone who is close. 

&#x200b;

every time i do something challenging and against something these psychs would say i get a piece of the picture or puzzle i had been longing for. 

&#x200b;

now that everything is documented too and is all on the table for my own eyes to see i can make sense of it properly as oppopsed to going to psychs and just yapping for 40 minutes then waiting a fortnight to yap again. this was never going to resolve shit for me.

&#x200b;

i have been able to access a lot of my repressed memories as i have began unpeeling layers of me. 

&#x200b;

i just want to own these memories and for them to be in front of me so that i can evaluate these incidents that have bothered me now as a grown adult at 34 and not 8 - \`10 when i was a child and maybe misinterpreted it etc...

&#x200b;

once i own all of this i can then bury it and never need to explore this past ever again.   


it also means all of this stress is lifted.

&#x200b;

further what is interesting is despite going to psychologists there was always going to be more i can admit to my ownself then to others. as it is there to protect me. how many years would i need to go to psychs to get to the bottom of this?  


$50,000 down the drain :(

&#x200b;

now my conscience is clear as fucken day light and i own me !!!

as for the job i could get one whenever but this personal issue of mine is something i keep on dragging and needed to get to the bottom of so that i don't let it influence me ever again and so that i acknowledge that it is now in the past and i did everything i could with it and should be proud as i didn't hide from myself.

i'm concerned that i'll be unable to work as hard as others because of the interplay between bipolar and stress.

do you guys know of any bipolar people who have been able to succeed under much stress/strain and long work hours?

i don't want to have an episode because i'm pushing 60 - 80 hours a week for success.

[april 20th]
hi, its me again. i posted about this problem way back in april where i had come home from a hard and extreme lower back workout (was almost passing out) without eating or drinking much that day. after some kidney pain a few hours later and fever it ended up with me going to the er having an elevated creatinine level. i went home just to sleep 2-3 hours just to come back to the er and having a creatinine level of 290-300. it ended up with me staying there for 5+ days and my levels basically went like a wave peaking and going down. i took creatine then (normal amounts) before the workout.

the doc blamed it on that or some stupid rat virus since he couldnt solve it. because of how we just waited the kidneys out and did nothing, i now have kidneys that hurt the second i dont treat them like a god. if i now drink too little water i get pain, caffeine with not much water and i exp pain again. sometimes when i jog a bit my kidneys to vibrate, which causes pain. i wasent like this before.

after a few months i workout again after long breaks and experience kidney pain when i do hard workouts especially concerning lower back like bad barbell biceps curls where i use a bit of my back on the last reps (stupid). and yea, i know the diff between kidney and back pain by now. so from april until now i experienced this phenomenon about 3-4 times.

[august 20th]
my friend is over from belgium and we go workout. he does chest i did legs/lowerback. i was feeling weak this workout aswell. my last excersize was this devil https://www.garage-gyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/back-extension-machine.jpg . after that last excersize i atart feeling light headed, half ""awake"" and i could not hear from my left ear. an hour after i hot some kidney pain again, was borderline er but the lazy person that i am and with my low trust in doctors (in my city) i figured if im going to lay in a bed and wait it out in the er, i might aswell stay home.

here is where shit gets interesting and real. my father does the exact same routine as my first time ending up in the hospital. he goes swimming and gets hell of a lower back workour for it. it ended up wity him going to the hospital and having high creatinine aswell. this is obviously a genetic problem, however the doctor refuses to acknowledge that.

[december 14th (3-4 days ago)]
i run th threadmill for 10 minutes, do some leg press. i almost feint after each sets of leg press. i get lightheaded each time and im very weak compared to what im normally supposed to lift. my last excersize messed me up, badly. you guessed it, its the devils machine itself https://www.garage-gyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/back-extension-machine.jpg . i was extremely lightheaded and had to stop my workout after 2-3 sets of this back extension machine. i cannot feel my arms and half my view is blavked out. i made it to the couch, sat doen and took a rest. when i got home and started to feel sick/kidney pain/fever i knew how the rest of this week would end up.

i end up in the er and stuck in a room for the rest of the week taking tests 24/7 again. the same old proseizure over again. 300 creatinine, pain etc.

my doctor never suspected rhabdolysis which i had to google. i asked him to take a ck test on the third day i was in. it was elevated and i had high phosphorus. yet, his reasoning on why it cannot be rhab is because he doesnt believe that you can get it from a simple workout.

what do i do from here? doc thinks that theres some variable that im hiding from him like suppliments or steroids with no basis or test results pointing at it simply because of the creatine i took the first time. im about to be sent out tomorrow since we all know that my values are going down and will go down.

1. hard workout after long break = high creatinine
2. back workouts then to be the cause
3. my father has the exact same problem
4. ck results elevated as i expected even tho doc was calling it a waste of time since he thought they would come out normal.

his main argument is that one workout cannot cause all of this.",191.0,613.0,0.72,2017-12-17 14:56:47,arviko,0.0,0.0,14.0,4263.0,793.0,386,0,0.15458937,0.0,0.0012077295,0.02294686,0.015700484,0.0,0.028985507999999997,0.012077293999999999,0.07004831,0.0012077295,0.002415459,0.0,0.004830918,0.04710145,0.06521739,0.04468599,0.007246376999999999,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.053140096,0.0012077295,0.06642512,0.06521739,0.020531401,0.02294686,0.010869565,0.09541063,0.031400967,0.059178744000000005,0.0,0.019323671,0.013285024,0.06642512,0.002415459,0.024154589,0.0,0.0,0.013285024,0.04347826,0.07487923,0.0012077295,0.5048309,0.036231883,0.002415459,0.012077293999999999,0.08091787,0.013285024,0.008454106,0.018115941,0.015700484,0.04951691,0.025362318,0.015700484,0.0,0.027777778,0.014492753999999998,0.037439615,0.004830918,0.006038646999999999,0.038647342,0.031400967,0.007246376999999999,0.031400967,0.10144927,0.12922706,0.15096618,0.020531401,0.20289855,0.004830918,0.014492753999999998,0.008454106,0.006038646999999999,0.002415459,0.0,0.012077293999999999,0.038647342,0.08454106,0.002415459,0.024154589,0.002415459,0.10507246,0.13888889999999998,0.0036231884999999996,0.009661836,0.002415459,0

9zrbmg,it’s okay to cuss around kids in public,38.0,35.0,39.0,unpopularopinion,"now, listen. if you are working with kids in a daycare or something then it is absolutely inappropriate to use profanity. but if you're in a public area, you should be able to use obscene language as you so please without yappy parents hounding you about it. people shouldn't have to censor themselves just because you decided to take your kid into the real world, it's not society's responsibility to raise your kid. your kids will learn what every swear word is by the time they reach the age of 8. it's inevitable. they will overhear it on tv, in public spaces, at school, etc. you will simply have to teach your kid not to repeat those words. 

seriously. kids won't turn into serial killers because they heard the word ''fuck''. they're *just words*. grow up.",2866.0,11706.0,0.8,2018-11-23 21:38:23,cruelcherry,0.0,0.0,8.0,764.0,136.0,98,0,0.22794117,0.080882356,0.0,0.04411765,0.0,0.0,0.014705882,0.0,0.0882353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014705882,0.007352941,0.05882353,0.029411765,0.007352941,0.014705882,0.0,0.04411765,0.007352941,0.11764706,0.007352941,0.0,0.029411765,0.022058823999999998,0.13970588,0.007352941,0.066176474,0.007352941,0.05147059,0.029411765,0.073529415,0.007352941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036764707,0.014705882,0.13970588,0.0,0.5808824,0.0,0.022058823999999998,0.0,0.0,0.014705882,0.0,0.014705882,0.007352941,0.05882353,0.007352941,0.0,0.0,0.014705882,0.036764707,0.022058823999999998,0.0,0.0,0.007352941,0.022058823999999998,0.007352941,0.04411765,0.11029412,0.15441176,0.16911764,0.007352941,0.13970588,0.0,0.007352941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007352941,0.0,0.22794117,0.080882356,0.007352941,0.029411765,0.029411765,0.04411765,0.1985294,0.0,0.036764707,0.080882356,0

she was a virgin, never done drugs or even drank and was very sheltered. she is really cool and fun and you wouldn't think she was sheltered, but because of how her father is and she went to a small private high school she didnt make many friends. i was the opposite. at the age of 16 i went from being an athlete to partying. i got into alcohol, and then drugs. by 17 i was a heroin addict. i used til i was 19. i went to treatment several times then got clean after i moved away. from there i got my life back i together. i stayed sober for a year before i started working and then i got my ged. i then got a better job working in medical manufacturing. it inspired me to go to school to become an engineer. math has always come easy to me and i loved the environment so i decided to pursue it. for the last three years i have been in school and am now at a university close to getting my bachelors done with. i am still with the manufacturing company because they treat me really well, work with my schedule and have given me a special position where i make really good money while i'm in school....

so i haven't drank or done drugs in over 6 years, have a great job, am almost done with school and for the last year i have been living very healthy and go to the gym almost daily....

her father is one of those really religious crazy parents and a crazy athlete parent. he has told her she cant date until shes done with medical school. she still lives at home because it's next to the university. she cant work because of her busy and demanding schedule with gymnastics and school, so she relies on her parents for money and stuff. i try to help her but she won't let me...

because of how her father is and because hes threatened her from dating she had to keep me a secret. her mother, sister(older doesnt live at home), brother(older doesnt live at home) and all her friends know about me though. her father has physically hurt her multiple times and she believes hes bipolar. he can go from a good dad to a violent asshole in a second. 

my gf and i are completely in love and everything was going amazing. her family supported us and everyone thought it was time to tell her father that she liked someone. 

she told her father several nights ago and he was happy for her. i was shook. he said he wanted to meet me and all that stuff. her mom has been supportive the whole time and was telling him how i seem like a good man. it was a huge relief that he now knew and accepted....

the next morning i wake up to multiple texts from my gf. basically he completely flipped the switch. a couple months ago my gfs sister did a background check and saw that i had a paraphernalia charge from 2011 on my record. the night my gf told her dad about us, she told her sister that she told her dad. i guess her sister, who acted like she supported us, called her dad and told him i was a ""druggy"". this is what caused her father to go insane. 

the whole family started fighting. her father went after my gf because she was defending me. her mom had to get between them so he didnt hurt her. my gf explained how it was something from my past and i am completely different now, but he didnt care. ge then started saying all these things he didnt like about me, and forbid her to see me... we are in love and she cant just stop seeing me. all we wanted was for him to give me the chance to meet him and then make up his decision. he said he would never meet me because i am never going to be a part of his family. he started calling me a perverted drug addict and demanded she told me to get lost. 

oh and he was also saying that because i was good looking that i wasn't actually a virgin. before i met my gf i was. up til i was 19 i had chances but never went through with them because when i was younger(12) an older girl pressured me into doing sexual stuff, and ever since then i had a horrible feeling of guilt every time i was about to have sex so i always backed out. which i'm glad of now. my gf was the first woman i didnt get this feeling with. we waited a few months before we had sex, but when we did i didnt get that feeling. i think it's because we are in love? anyway, he kept saying i was lying about that. he was attacking my character in every way.... he was also saying he would blow my head off if i didnt leave her alone. 

yesterday they kept fighting about it. i was on the phone with my gf and heard what her mom said:

mom: ""after what we learned yesterday i cant believe you feel the same:

gf: "" you cant judge someone based on stuff that happened more than 6 years ago. i fell in love with who he is now""

mom: ""oh yes you can. i thought you had higher standards""

gf: ""really mom? thanks! hes perfect now and you guys won't even give him a chance....""

it actually hurt hearing her mom say that. i had just bought her a couple christmas gifts the other day and was excited to give them to her. but my gf says those weren't her words and that her mom was also scared of her dad. 

just an hour ago my phone rang and it was my gfs house. i picked it up and said hello. it was her dad. he told me if i didnt leave her alone that her brothers would come after me, then just hung up. 

now idk what to do? i feel so bad for my gf because she has dealt with him her whole life and now she has to deal with this because of me. but we are so in love and we make eachother better. we want to be together forever. the plan was she would move in next fall, but now her father is saying i will never be a part of his family and he wants her to never talk to me. she is saying he doesnt matter and it's his loss if he doesnt want anything to do with her. she says we will always be together and if she loses her family because they won't even give me a chance than that's their loss.

i feel terrible. she has told me how her dad is but i always reminded her that it is her dad and i want them to have a good relationship. i told her we should live closer to her family because i want her to remain close to them, but now they want nothing to do with me. i just wish they knew how much i loved her and how i would never hurt her or do anything bad to her. i wish they could see me how i am now, but they won't give me a chance...

what should i do?

tl;dr my gfs father threatened me because he found out i did drugs when i was younger. even though i've been sober over 6 years he told my gf she cant see me. she told him she wouldn't stop and he went after her and threatened to blow my head off. he then called me tonight and threatened sending her brothers after me if i didnt leave her alone.

here's my boot order

i've tried disabling programs in start up (honestly nothing much) with no change and i'm not sure where to go from here... i've checked the system configuration and the boot time shows as 30 seconds if that helps (which is default).

awscvv,haha my nmom who hasn't spoken to her sister in many months got her to speak to me on the phone about me being jobless.,1.0,1.0,119.0,raisedbynarcissists,"my aunty was not prepared to listen and i frankly don't tolerate that kind of shit for anyone. 

&#x200b;

what is more ironic is my nmom goes mental and forbids me to work if the job title is not up to her par haha. 

&#x200b;

eh but why did it get this bad? long story.

&#x200b;

specifically emotional abuse and now i have seen i was raped too but this was deeply suppressed. 

&#x200b;

it begins with childhood trauma, owning up to the fact that the last 20 years of seeing psychologists did jack shit. my 9 - 10 years of being on antidepressants which i struggle to get off fucken destroyed me and made me the lazy no good person i am today.

&#x200b;

however all of this could have of been avoided if the specialists were doing their fucken jobs. in the end i had adhd !!!!

&#x200b;

once i got the proper medication my parents fucken denied me from having as a child when the teachers made it known to them a few times there were behavioural issues with me i was able to unfuck myself !!!!

&#x200b;

i have been deeply self analysing myself and it has done wonders. my bipolar diagnosis and being told i have depression from a young age could be anything as far as i am concerned now as it is maybe learnt behaviour from a nut case narcisstic mom who decided to take on what her father started which was some deep abuse on anyone who is close. 

&#x200b;

every time i do something challenging and against something these psychs would say i get a piece of the picture or puzzle i had been longing for. 

&#x200b;

now that everything is documented too and is all on the table for my own eyes to see i can make sense of it properly as oppopsed to going to psychs and just yapping for 40 minutes then waiting a fortnight to yap again. this was never going to resolve shit for me.

&#x200b;

i have been able to access a lot of my repressed memories as i have began unpeeling layers of me. 

&#x200b;

i just want to own these memories and for them to be in front of me so that i can evaluate these incidents that have bothered me now as a grown adult at 34 and not 8 - \`10 when i was a child and maybe misinterpreted it etc...

&#x200b;

once i own all of this i can then bury it and never need to explore this past ever again.   


it also means all of this stress is lifted.

&#x200b;

further what is interesting is despite going to psychologists there was always going to be more i can admit to my ownself then to others. as it is there to protect me. how many years would i need to go to psychs to get to the bottom of this?  


$50,000 down the drain :(

&#x200b;

now my conscience is clear as fucken day light and i own me !!!

&#x200b;

as for the job i could get one whenever but this personal issue of mine is something i keep on dragging and needed to get to the bottom of so that i don't let it influence me ever again and so that i acknowledge that it is now in the past and i did everything i could with it and should be proud as i didn't hide from myself.

9m1k8r,which approach do i follow?,3.0,3.0,27.0,dating_advice,"i hear so many things. i've been a browser of this subreddit as i am a male in a predicament.

i hear so many things. shower them with attention. make plans with them. be there for them. let them do the talking, or the first move. play hard to get.

which approach is the best approach?

i've been hanging outside with this girl for a while, every weekend and then some. she's hit me up at ten pm before, which isn't between the normal hours of work, or  has invited me to do things with her. she's also visited me at work, gave me chocolate, and we see each other often.

she's asked me when we were going to hang out or recommended the movies. we've been to the museum, and she's let me meet her childhood friend one week when she came to town to visit.

a78t51,i (m25) was just threatened by my gf's (f20) dad (m56) because he doesnt want me to see her,6.0,7.0,91.0,relationships,"my gf and i have been going out for almost a year. she is a college gymnast and student, and i work full time and am a student. she is black and i am white. 

she was a virgin, never done drugs or even drank and was very sheltered. she is really cool and fun and you wouldn't think she was sheltered, but because of how her father is and she went to a small private high school she didnt make many friends. i was the opposite. at the age of 16 i went from being an athlete to partying. i got into alcohol, and then drugs. by 17 i was a heroin addict. i used til i was 19. i went to treatment several times then got clean after i moved away. from there i got my life back i together. i stayed sober for a year before i started working and then i got my ged. i then got a better job working in medical manufacturing. it inspired me to go to school to become an engineer. math has always come easy to me and i loved the environment so i decided to pursue it. for the last three years i have been in school and am now at a university close to getting my bachelors done with. i am still with the manufacturing company because they treat me really well, work with my schedule and have given me a special position where i make really good money while i'm in school....

so i haven't drank or done drugs in over 6 years, have a great job, am almost done with school and for the last year i have been living very healthy and go to the gym almost daily....

her father is one of those really religious crazy parents and a crazy athlete parent. he has told her she cant date until shes done with medical school. she still lives at home because it's next to the university. she cant work because of her busy and demanding schedule with gymnastics and school, so she relies on her parents for money and stuff. i try to help her but she won't let me...

because of how her father is and because hes threatened her from dating she had to keep me a secret. her mother, sister(older doesnt live at home), brother(older doesnt live at home) and all her friends know about me though. her father has physically hurt her multiple times and she believes hes bipolar. he can go from a good dad to a violent asshole in a second. 

my gf and i are completely in love and everything was going amazing. her family supported us and everyone thought it was time to tell her father that she liked someone. 

she told her father several nights ago and he was happy for her. i was shook. he said he wanted to meet me and all that stuff. her mom has been supportive the whole time and was telling him how i seem like a good man. it was a huge relief that he now knew and accepted....

the next morning i wake up to multiple texts from my gf. basically he completely flipped the switch. a couple months ago my gfs sister did a background check and saw that i had a paraphernalia charge from 2011 on my record. the night my gf told her dad about us, she told her sister that she told her dad. i guess her sister, who acted like she supported us, called her dad and told him i was a ""druggy"". this is what caused her father to go insane. 

the whole family started fighting. her father went after my gf because she was defending me. her mom had to get between them so he didnt hurt her. my gf explained how it was something from my past and i am completely different now, but he didnt care. ge then started saying all these things he didnt like about me, and forbid her to see me... we are in love and she cant just stop seeing me. all we wanted was for him to give me the chance to meet him and then make up his decision. he said he would never meet me because i am never going to be a part of his family. he started calling me a perverted drug addict and demanded she told me to get lost. 

oh and he was also saying that because i was good looking that i wasn't actually a virgin. before i met my gf i was. up til i was 19 i had chances but never went through with them because when i was younger(12) an older girl pressured me into doing sexual stuff, and ever since then i had a horrible feeling of guilt every time i was about to have sex so i always backed out. which i'm glad of now. my gf was the first woman i didnt get this feeling with. we waited a few months before we had sex, but when we did i didnt get that feeling. i think it's because we are in love? anyway, he kept saying i was lying about that. he was attacking my character in every way.... he was also saying he would blow my head off if i didnt leave her alone. 

yesterday they kept fighting about it. i was on the phone with my gf and heard what her mom said:

mom: ""after what we learned yesterday i cant believe you feel the same:

gf: "" you cant judge someone based on stuff that happened more than 6 years ago. i fell in love with who he is now""

mom: ""oh yes you can. i thought you had higher standards""

gf: ""really mom? thanks! hes perfect now and you guys won't even give him a chance....""

it actually hurt hearing her mom say that. i had just bought her a couple christmas gifts the other day and was excited to give them to her. but my gf says those weren't her words and that her mom was also scared of her dad. 

just an hour ago my phone rang and it was my gfs house. i picked it up and said hello. it was her dad. he told me if i didnt leave her alone that her brothers would come after me, then just hung up. 

now idk what to do? i feel so bad for my gf because she has dealt with him her whole life and now she has to deal with this because of me. but we are so in love and we make eachother better. we want to be together forever. the plan was she would move in next fall, but now her father is saying i will never be a part of his family and he wants her to never talk to me. she is saying he doesnt matter and it's his loss if he doesnt want anything to do with her. she says we will always be together and if she loses her family because they won't even give me a chance than that's their loss.

i feel terrible. she has told me how her dad is but i always reminded her that it is her dad and i want them to have a good relationship. i told her we should live closer to her family because i want her to remain close to them, but now they want nothing to do with me. i just wish they knew how much i loved her and how i would never hurt her or do anything bad to her. i wish they could see me how i am now, but they won't give me a chance...

what should i do?

tl;dr my gfs father threatened me because he found out i did drugs when i was younger. even though i've been sober over 6 years he told my gf she cant see me. she told him she wouldn't stop and he went after her and threatened to blow my head off. he then called me tonight and threatened sending her brothers after me if i didnt leave her alone.

(i have a diagnosis and medication, but it doesn’t always work.) 

i’m wondering if it would be better to proactively let people know during my flares to counteract the disbelief after being confronted and because many professor, supervisors and what not just ignore it but might think i am sleeping, which could harm my professional and academic reputation.

the problem is when i have had such conversations,  they can be awkward and people tend to think i’m lying for whatever reason. which is also terrible for academic and professional development. when this happens these conversations can mar my self esteem and be unbelievably frustrating.

i was blown away. this is gonna be one of the anime that i can proudly show to people when they ask ""you watch anime?""

yeah. i watch this.

highly recommended just for the visuals alone. the story seems promising as well. i hope there is romance involved as it is my favorite genre.

i'm going to ask him for more tips like this. just wish i had found out a long time ago. it's different from just asking about oral, because this stops the guy from expecting a blowjob even when he won't go down on me. i considered just refusing to give blowjobs, but i think this could work instead.

i came up with an app that i wish existed, but being a developer i can see the incredibly complicated reasons why it doesn't.  doesn't matter though, we don't actually have to build the app.

it's a wood species identifier application.  basically, take a pic of a couple sides of your board and endgrain, and the app will tell you that you have eastern red cedar, for example.

i have (survey link) - this has been approved by the mods, and i'd really appreciate any help i can get on this, as i only need a handful of responses.

a5249a,looking for insight on the talk program in korea?,2.0,2.0,49.0,TEFL,"does anyone have any experience with the talk program in korea? the only posts i can find about it are quite old and i’m not sure if they are still relevant. 

i’ve applied but their application process doesn’t start til march of next year. i’ve applied for a 6 month contract, though their website says that those looking for 12 month contracts are given priority, so is it worth my while to change to 12 months for the sake of getting a position? any insight of what to expect in the program? from what i can tell from their website and contract details, it seems like a great opportunity, though the pay is on the lower end of the spectrum for teaching in asia but that doesn’t really bother me!

yes, there are trash mumble rappers out there right now. but there are trash artists in your genre too? 


hip hop is beautiful. when it is done right, with beautiful production, (like kanye wests mbdtf) or with great rapping, (like eminem’s marshall mathers lp) it is some amazing music.

their are still some amazing rappers out there. kanye west is still an amazing artist. kendrick lamar releases some great music. travis scott, a$ap rocky etc are all solid rappers.

9u4vum,describe your no-pmo strategy in 100 words or less!,3.0,8.0,51.0,NoFap,"hello all! i see lots and lots of posts on here with long detailed explanations about their strategies for success on no-fap, and most if not all of them are insightful and interesting, but often that doesn't cut it for people. let's see if we can boil down our strategies to just a couple bullet points, around 100 words or less, include your weakness too if you have the space. give me your elevator pitch! 

i can start us off.

&#x200b;

strategy:

* the only time you're in the bedroom is for sleeping for the night
* if you have to nap, do so in a public room without doors
* when in your room, power your phone completely off, have no other electronics
* necessary electronics are kept and charged in public rooms
* only touch down there when cleaning or relieving yourself
* know who you can contact in an emergency urge and get a quick response from (vital)

weakness:

* my work and life do not permit me to completely cut out technology, temptation is perpetual. idle scrolling will always lead to a trigger eventually

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

there we go! that's my strategy in 100 words. thank you to anyone else willing to post and share their methodology!",4407.0,171.0,0.83,2018-11-04 18:55:30,Spiffybumble,0.0,0.0,9.0,1166.0,211.0,141,0,0.20487805,0.019512195,0.009756098000000001,0.03902439,0.004878049000000001,0.019512195,0.06341463,0.009756098000000001,0.024390243,0.0,0.0,0.014634146,0.034146342,0.024390243,0.07804878,0.043902437999999995,0.034146342,0.0,0.0,0.043902437999999995,0.0,0.07804878,0.019512195,0.004878049000000001,0.019512195,0.029268292999999997,0.14634146,0.009756098000000001,0.08292683,0.0,0.058536585,0.019512195,0.107317075,0.0,0.004878049000000001,0.0,0.0,0.009756098000000001,0.004878049000000001,0.13170731,0.004878049000000001,0.5609755999999999,0.009756098000000001,0.004878049000000001,0.024390243,0.029268292999999997,0.0,0.0,0.014634146,0.014634146,0.029268292999999997,0.004878049000000001,0.0,0.0,0.009756098000000001,0.029268292999999997,0.009756098000000001,0.0,0.0,0.009756098000000001,0.019512195,0.029268292999999997,0.034146342,0.11707317,0.14634146,0.14634146,0.034146342,0.1609756,0.0,0.014634146,0.0,0.0,0.009756098000000001,0.0,0.0,0.13658537,0.09756097,0.0,0.053658538,0.014634146,0.048780486,0.12195122,0.024390243,0.014634146,0.048780486,0
as24lq,"i hate that most guys demand blowjobs, and refuse to let it go",3.0,43.0,62.0,TrueOffMyChest,"i keep telling them i'm not into blowjobs, and they ignore me and try to convince me that i can be. thankfully we're only texting when this happens, so it's not much stress. but it's starting to really annoy me. i'm just trying to find a hookup. so i tell them right away that i'm not interested in bjs, and they'll do everything they can to convince me to try it. they just say that i haven't been with the right guy, that i need to learn to like it, that they won't cum in my mouth and we can work up to that, and all these other ideas.



i've never been on a hookup (not a virgin, just haven't had casual sex), so i guess i was out of the loop. i've only had 1 past bf, but he really liked me so he'd never want to not listen to me...i'm wondering if i should just avoid hookups/random guys.



i have talked to guys who only want to go down on me and don't even want blowjobs...but as awesome as they sound, in my experience they push too hard. like they have a fetish. i'm really not prepared to deal with fetishes, and it makes me feel too nervous.

edit: apparently, my post comes off like i demand guys go down on me but refuse to give them blowjobs. that's definitely not what i'm talking about...",203.0,1950.0,1.0,2019-02-18 23:11:38,VisionGoku1,0.0,0.0,13.0,1207.0,237.0,138,0,0.23012552,0.07531381,0.0041841003,0.050209206,0.0,0.0,0.0041841003,0.008368201,0.087866105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016736401,0.025104603,0.09623431,0.050209206,0.029288704,0.0041841003,0.012552301,0.025104603,0.0041841003,0.12552302,0.037656903,0.0041841003,0.0041841003,0.020920502,0.17573221,0.016736401,0.07949791,0.0,0.07531381,0.025104603,0.07112971,0.0,0.008368201,0.0,0.0,0.012552301,0.033472802,0.18828452,0.020920502,0.6736401999999999,0.0,0.012552301,0.0,0.12552302,0.008368201,0.0,0.029288704,0.012552301,0.07531381,0.0041841003,0.029288704,0.0,0.016736401,0.054393305999999995,0.020920502,0.0041841003,0.0,0.0041841003,0.025104603,0.025104603,0.020920502,0.18828452,0.14225942,0.26359832,0.008368201,0.10460251,0.0,0.0,0.0041841003,0.0,0.0,0.033472802,0.008368201,0.12970711,0.06276151,0.0,0.033472802,0.046025105,0.020920502,0.24686192,0.008368201,0.012552301,0.0,0
9vu8sl,mr einstein and the tv remote aka the only time i ever really yelled at mr einstein,67.0,5.0,83.0,Justnofil,"words like 'parent' give me the heebiejeebies these days, so let's call my progenitors 'mr and mrs einstein'. i've been nc for 6+ years so don't worry :)

previous episode: [https://www.reddit.com/r/justnomil/comments/9v9bqe/mrs\_einstein\_and\_the\_holocaust\_movie\_aka/](https://www.reddit.com/r/justnomil/comments/9v9bqe/mrs_einstein_and_the_holocaust_movie_aka/)

\---

in this story i'm about 16. we had 1 tv in the house in the living room. i have 2 younger siblings, so it was a very frequent occurrance that we would hide the tv remote from each other. in hindsight this wasn't very funny, but it was presented to me as funny at the time (i'm autistic so i'm not always the best with social cues). this is the story of what happened when i tried it on mr einstein. *\[i'm getting anxious just thinking about this fucking story so pls be nice\]*

i'm home with mr einstein and ys. mrs e and yb are out. we're watching tv and it's commercial break, so everyone gets up and goes to the bathroom and whatnot. i decide to take the tv remote from where mr einstein was sitting and put it behind a plant pot. he comes back. starts looking for the remote. i'm standing in the (open plan) kitchen snickering, so he's onto me pretty quickly.

he asks me where the remote is. i feign ignorance. he tells me i have until the count of 3 to make the remote appear. i decide to call his bluff. (he doesn't seem angry, just annoyed.)

1...

2...

3!

he *pounces* on me, presses me against the kitchen counter and *twists my arm behind my back*.

i am so shocked, i scream. i've never screamed before in my life. he doesn't respond except to yell at me about where the remote is. i don't understand what's happening.

i scream again, louder. he keeps yelling at me. why is he doing this?? i'm so confused and shocked.

i scream again, as loud and high as i can. i have never felt so helpless before. einstein is still yelling about the remote. it finally clicks in my brain that he is *actually, honest to fucking god, using violence on me over a fucking tv remote.* so i tell him where it is.

he lets go, grabs the remote, and sits back down on the couch like nothing happened.

what. just. happened.

i stand in the kitchen for a little while, shaking, nursing my arm. slowly i work through my shock and my pain. and then i get angry.

to give you a little context: i n-e-v-e-r used to get angry. i was the most perfect little docile doormat you ever did see. i barely knew how to have an opinion when i was that age. but most of the einsteins abuse was psychological and emotional, which was very hard for an autistic teenager to parse and diagnose. physical violence, however, is very easily diagnosed as *wrong*. even i knew that. so i knew what just happened was *wrong*. and i got **angry**.

i stalked up to where he and ys where sitting and yelled over the tv: 'what. the. fuck. is wrong with you?!?? who twists their daughters arm over a tv remote?!?!? who does that?!?!?'

i know what you're thinking. stupid move right? but surpise surprise: he didn't actually beat me back into submission. i'm not sure if it's because ys was sitting there, or because i'd [threatened with cps over physical violence before](https://www.reddit.com/r/justnofil/comments/9qcn2j/mr_einstein_and_the_physical_abuse_i_never_tell/), or because i, you know, actually had a point. but he didn't explode again.

now, he didn't apologise of course. he just sort of mumbled something about the remote and me being stupid. then ys (the gc) chimed in with 'god stop yelling, why do you always have to be so dramatic??' because of course this was all my fault and had nothing to do with me being abused right in front of her. and i decided to count this as a win and retreated to my room. and it was furiously rugsweeped and never mentioned again.",16272.0,1525.0,0.97,2018-11-10 15:21:24,JCXIII-R,0.0,0.0,17.0,3823.0,660.0,344,0,0.34265736,0.047552448,0.005594406,0.034965035,0.00979021,0.0083916085,0.10209789999999999,0.016783217,0.0979021,0.01958042,0.0,0.0,0.0083916085,0.053146854,0.08531468,0.07552448,0.011188812,0.02937063,0.006993007,0.054545455,0.0,0.09230769400000001,0.026573427,0.005594406,0.013986014,0.018181818,0.095104896,0.02097902,0.08951049,0.002797203,0.027972028,0.002797203,0.07132867,0.0041958042,0.006993007,0.0083916085,0.0,0.0041958042,0.047552448,0.10769231,0.0,0.5608392,0.011188812,0.016783217,0.013986014,0.088111885,0.022377623,0.0041958042,0.02097902,0.027972028,0.047552448,0.01958042,0.032167833,0.0,0.012587412,0.022377623,0.05874126,0.016783217,0.0,0.011188812,0.02937063,0.016783217,0.03776224,0.13146853,0.11608391,0.17902099,0.005594406,0.15244755,0.002797203,0.012587412,0.00979021,0.0013986015,0.005594406,0.005594406,0.026573427,0.09090909,0.09230769400000001,0.005594406,0.018181818,0.0013986015,0.054545455,0.18181819,0.006993007,0.006993007,0.0083916085,0

awscvv,haha my nmom who hasn't spoken to her sister in many months got her to speak to me on the phone about me being jobless.,1.0,1.0,119.0,raisedbynarcissists,"my aunty was not prepared to listen and i frankly don't tolerate that kind of shit for anyone. 

&#x200b;

what is more ironic is my nmom goes mental and forbids me to work if the job title is not up to her par haha. 

&#x200b;

eh but why did it get this bad? long story.

&#x200b;

specifically emotional abuse and now i have seen i was raped too but this was deeply suppressed. 

&#x200b;

it begins with childhood trauma, owning up to the fact that the last 20 years of seeing psychologists did jack shit. my 9 - 10 years of being on antidepressants which i struggle to get off fucken destroyed me and made me the lazy no good person i am today.

&#x200b;

however all of this could have of been avoided if the specialists were doing their fucken jobs. in the end i had adhd !!!!

&#x200b;

once i got the proper medication my parents fucken denied me from having as a child when the teachers made it known to them a few times there were behavioural issues with me i was able to unfuck myself !!!!

&#x200b;

i have been deeply self analysing myself and it has done wonders. my bipolar diagnosis and being told i have depression from a young age could be anything as far as i am concerned now as it is maybe learnt behaviour from a nut case narcisstic mom who decided to take on what her father started which was some deep abuse on anyone who is close. 

&#x200b;

every time i do something challenging and against something these psychs would say i get a piece of the picture or puzzle i had been longing for. 

&#x200b;

now that everything is documented too and is all on the table for my own eyes to see i can make sense of it properly as oppopsed to going to psychs and just yapping for 40 minutes then waiting a fortnight to yap again. this was never going to resolve shit for me.

&#x200b;

i have been able to access a lot of my repressed memories as i have began unpeeling layers of me. 

&#x200b;

i just want to own these memories and for them to be in front of me so that i can evaluate these incidents that have bothered me now as a grown adult at 34 and not 8 - \`10 when i was a child and maybe misinterpreted it etc...

&#x200b;

once i own all of this i can then bury it and never need to explore this past ever again.   


it also means all of this stress is lifted.

&#x200b;

further what is interesting is despite going to psychologists there was always going to be more i can admit to my ownself then to others. as it is there to protect me. how many years would i need to go to psychs to get to the bottom of this?  


$50,000 down the drain :(

&#x200b;

now my conscience is clear as fucken day light and i own me !!!

&#x200b;

as for the job i could get one whenever but this personal issue of mine is something i keep on dragging and needed to get to the bottom of so that i don't let it influence me ever again and so that i acknowledge that it is now in the past and i did everything i could with it and should be proud as i didn't hide from myself.

an0kq3,losing at the right moment can be better than winning,26.0,29.0,53.0,SquaredCircle,"wins and losses matter in stories. losing at key moments is often used to build character and make winning later better. some key examples. 

bret hart losing to davey boy at summerslam 92. bret putting the home town boy over made him a fan favourite and allowed him to move onwards and upwards. 

jeff hardy losing that ladder match. ''climb the ladder kid, make your self famous.'' it would be many years before jeff would capture a wwe/wh title but his barvery and resolve and the beating he took secured his place as a fan favourite singles star. 

becky losing to sasha at takeover. becky was basically a nobody going into this match. everyone there just wanted to see sasha. becky was a star walking out of the match. from the moment she was crying beaten down after the match where the fans sang her entrance music she hasn't lost fan support.


what are other examples of losing being the best thing for a wrestler?
