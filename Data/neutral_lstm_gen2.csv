9wo0xa,lincoln should have punished the rebels more.,8.0,8.0,45.0,unpopularopinion,"hannibal of carthage knew how to gain a victory but not how to use it. that phrase always perplexed me until i thought about the civil war and how the confederate government and military were basically given a pardon when they lost.  now look at all the shit we deal with today as a society barely holding together, ready to tear each other apart any second now. if lincoln punished everyone down to every second lieutenant we would probably be living in a better society now. there would be hardly no more racism, black people would not have had to suffer so much injustice from sore losers and their descendants. donald trump definitely would not be president and may not even have been born here if it weren’t for the white supremacy that attracted his father.  equality would be decades ahead for the country.  it’s just depressing to think about how lincoln didn’t use his victory, he could have solved a lot of today’s problems.  and do t give me any shit about “oh the confederates were democrats and lincoln was a republican” i like my history burger with a big side order of context thank you very much.

7xcymt,which woman do you think was the best fit for dexter?,24.0,49.0,53.0,Dexter,"rita, lumen, hannah, or debra? 

this may be an unpopular opinion but i think debra was the best woman for dexter, she’s stuck with him through thick and thin even when she saw his true colours. hannah, in my opinion, just made dexter so weak. i think she destroyed his character in a way. since when does dexter turn weak as soon as there’s a hot girl strapped down to his table? and why would he keep her around after she tried to kill his sister?

aotm6e,tifu by turning my 7 year old neighbor into a rebel,340.0,42.0,51.0,tifu,"this happened a few months ago when i was visiting my parents. i’m also on mobile, sorry for bad formatting. 

backstory: our neighbors (friends of my parents) have a 7 year old son, who was born prematurely. he’s very bright and has a lively personality, but just by looking at him you couldn’t tell that he’s older than 5 at most. due to being so small physically, he’s still in kindergarten and hasn’t started attending school (recommended by their doctor).

now, here’s how i fucked up:

his parents asked me to watch him for about an hour - which is something that i’ve never done prior to this day. i have no experience babysitting and never really talked to the little guy before, but i was fine with it. how hard could it be?

it started out fine. we played a little and eventually he came around to tell me about his experiences in kindergarten - apparently they like to play pretend there. some of them play dragons and others play dragon riders, how to train your dragon - style. he told me that he’s never allowed to play a cool dragon or dragon rider because he’s so small and admits that he gets bullied and is sometimes sad about this. 

naturally, i thought it would be wise to tell him that this is not okay. he had every right to play whichever dragon he wanted to play as, that the kids needed to be fair and let everyone have a chance to be who they wanted to be and how he shouldn’t let them decide for him. i gave him a whole speech about not listening to the bullies, how he’s not worth any less than them and that he should be ‘the master of his own fate’. (not my exact words, just hard to translate from my native language. you get the gist of it though)

eventually he heads back home and not an hour later his parents ring the doorbell. at first they thanked me sarcastically, before becoming visibly mad and telling me the following:

apparently, the little guy took my words to heart and when his parents tried to put their otherwise obedient and sweet son to bed, he rebelled and said that he was his own master and didn’t need to listen to them. he would, from this day forward, make his own decisions and go to bed when he felt like it. 

his parents left upset and since then, he’s apparently become pretty rebellious - but on the bright side also very confident. 

the parents still think that i told the boy to rebel against them on purpose and don’t believe my side of the story. 

tl;dr - i told my 7 year old neighbor to stand up to bullies who were being mean to him for being smaller than the others. instead, he started rebelling against his parents who now don’t like me.

antdzo,"it took me over a year to get my 1st job, all because no one told me about availability",1.0,0.0,87.0,TrueOffMyChest,"i'm just reminiscing...it's been years since then, but i'll never forget the level of stress i had. i just wanted to work in retail, but no matter how many times i filled out applications i was always denied. i put down all different slots of hours, looked up exact shift times, asked and googled for tips on how to get hired. but people rarely mentioned availability.

so i eventually found tips online about open availability. i had thought that i could never have that since i needed other ppl to drive me. it was impossible to work random hours. 

i finally, finally found one day a thread about how you can have open availability but then still tell the manager your preference for shifts. 

so you can technically work 24/7, but if your preference is for the midshift, then you'll only be scheduled for midshift 90% of the time. the other 10% of the time, you'll just cover any shift people call out of or that the manager desperately needs filled.

and that's exactly what happened to me. i worked midshift, and only closed or opened once every few weeks. i felt like i was in a dream.

i had filled out dozens of applications for no reason at all. none of them had open availability. i didn't know. when i found out the truth, i filled out only 10 applications, had 2 interviews at different stores, and finally got hired.

so it ended well. but i wasted so much of my time, and i had thought i was just a failure or that the economy was terrible. my parents even told me that. but the truth was that i just didn't know the rules.",203.0,1950.0,0.6,2019-02-06 19:54:15,VisionGoku1,0.0,0.0,19.0,1538.0,285.0,159,0,0.16724738,0.027874565,0.0,0.045296166,0.0,0.0,0.010452962,0.0,0.08362369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017421603,0.020905923,0.09756097,0.024390243,0.0034843206,0.0,0.006968640999999999,0.048780486,0.0,0.09756097,0.0,0.0,0.020905923,0.034843206,0.17421603,0.010452962,0.094076656,0.0,0.05923345,0.027874565,0.05574913,0.0034843206,0.0034843206,0.0,0.0,0.024390243,0.11149826,0.07317073,0.0,0.5818814999999999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09756097,0.006968640999999999,0.0,0.038327526,0.017421603,0.045296166,0.0034843206,0.0,0.010452962,0.006968640999999999,0.024390243,0.013937281999999999,0.0034843206,0.0034843206,0.031358887,0.006968640999999999,0.010452962,0.031358887,0.12195122,0.12195122,0.16724738,0.027874565,0.18118466,0.0,0.006968640999999999,0.0034843206,0.0034843206,0.0034843206,0.0,0.0,0.05923345,0.07665505,0.0,0.020905923,0.0034843206,0.09756097,0.19163764,0.0,0.05574913,0.020905923,0

we dated a while so knowing her (i knew her really well) it must’ve broke her heart to see me block her out of her life completely. i feel bad but it was for the best for me.

sexual harassment/assault? much easier to get away with when mega rich. 

in so many court cases the rich were treated unfairly due to their money. 


also, if their crime isn’t that bad, they can just pay bail and never have to serve a day in prison.

asioyl,"the easy patient riser: i help nurses and other healthcare professionals get heavy patients fdom sitting in a wheelchair to standing anywhere, without electricity, in order to prevent injury to caretakers back.",8.0,1.0,210.0,Lightbulb,"my school is having an innovation challenge, grand prize is 3000 dollars, and i need the money for a surgery my insurance won't cover, so i am trying really hard and would love your input.

my mom has been a nurse for over 40 years, and as she has gotten older she's started to have issues with her back. some research shows that over 80% of nurses will have back problems later in their lives. talking to nurses i have found that they feel the greatest stain on their back occurs trying to lift patients from sitting to standing (free body diagrams have shown this to be true, to strain put on a back at that angle trying to move people who can be up to 600lbs is insane). 

the health care industry is obviously huge, and it's only growing with the population. these people take care of you literally since before you're even born. growing obesity in america only adds to the need for a way to lift patients.

the actual design behind the wheelchair is pretty simple. a hydraulic lift under the chair will push it up and tilt the chair (much like the electronic lift chair recliners you commonly see) and tilt the patient up and onto their feet. it's powered by a pump in front that the nurse will push with her foot. it being in front so she can face the patient and steady them as they get up. a simple handle in back will bring the chair back down. the rest of the design will be simple to keep it easy to clean and durable.

 all in all it works more or less like a hydraulic lift table, but at an angle. it is geared twords overweight patients because those are the ones most likely to cause injury. while there are standing wheelchairs on the market, they all have lower weight capacity, rely on electronics, and are very clearly not designed for hospital use. 

so that's a quick overview, if you have any questions please ask, it's good practice for judging, and any recommendations or help you could offer i would absolutely love.",8924.0,11596.0,0.81,2019-02-20 04:22:58,peterjmonday,0.0,0.0,32.0,1941.0,359.0,210,0,0.11699165,0.019498607,0.0,0.0362117,0.0,0.0,0.0027855153000000002,0.011142061000000002,0.04735376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019498607,0.058495822999999995,0.050139274000000005,0.04735376,0.008356546,0.0,0.0027855153000000002,0.08077995,0.0027855153000000002,0.11420613,0.050139274000000005,0.013927577,0.011142061000000002,0.019498607,0.09749304,0.033426184,0.06128134,0.0,0.016713092,0.019498607,0.07799443,0.0027855153000000002,0.008356546,0.016713092,0.0,0.016713092,0.013927577,0.1281337,0.0,0.5459609999999999,0.03064067,0.0,0.0,0.019498607,0.0027855153000000002,0.008356546,0.008356546,0.0027855153000000002,0.04735376,0.0,0.0,0.013927577,0.019498607,0.005571030500000001,0.008356546,0.0,0.0,0.008356546,0.013927577,0.038997214,0.0362117,0.06963788,0.15041783,0.11699165,0.03064067,0.14206128,0.0,0.016713092,0.0027855153000000002,0.0027855153000000002,0.005571030500000001,0.0,0.013927577,0.08077995,0.09749304,0.0,0.0362117,0.019498607,0.04178273,0.18941504,0.0,0.019498607,0.016713092,0

atkisa,i've been slowly finding out how much people lie on reddit,18.0,13.0,58.0,TrueOffMyChest,"i really liked a fairly popular poster so i always looked for their comments. but one day i saw them post about their mental health. they said they had 5 different mental illness diagnoses. and when i went deeper into their post history, i found all these different stories about abuse. abuse from friends, family, strangers, partners, etc. it all went way past the line of sounding believable when i put all the stories together, so i finally had to realize that they must've lied about everything.

so now when i see someone post a trauma story, i click on their account to find out more. 90% of the time, they're also posting all these outrageous stories that just don't add up. some people talk about their dramatic memories in every single comment they make.

i never knew people wanted attention that badly. you'd think they'd feel bad for tricking everyone in the comments to give advice and sympathy.",203.0,1950.0,0.89,2019-02-22 19:46:18,VisionGoku1,0.0,0.0,11.0,908.0,159.0,111,0,0.15723270000000003,0.031446543,0.0,0.050314464,0.0,0.0,0.006289308,0.0,0.06918239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050314464,0.10062893,0.056603774,0.031446543,0.025157232,0.0,0.03773585,0.0,0.044025157,0.018867925,0.0,0.006289308,0.062893085,0.17610063,0.025157232,0.062893085,0.0,0.025157232,0.006289308,0.050314464,0.006289308,0.006289308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805031,0.0754717,0.018867925,0.47169809999999995,0.018867925,0.018867925,0.006289308,0.062893085,0.0,0.0,0.056603774,0.018867925,0.056603774,0.012578616,0.0,0.006289308,0.018867925,0.012578616,0.044025157,0.0,0.0,0.025157232,0.044025157,0.012578616,0.006289308,0.13836478,0.11320755,0.19496855,0.056603774,0.16352202,0.0,0.006289308,0.006289308,0.0,0.018867925,0.0,0.0,0.22012578,0.056603774,0.0,0.018867925,0.06918239,0.06918239,0.15723270000000003,0.0,0.0,0.006289308,0

awo0pu,three in one,13.0,0.0,12.0,nosleep,"i couldn't afford college so i took several jobs outside of high school. first i worked for a gas station for a year, which i enjoyed. i could sneak out beer out the back and not get in trouble. then i worked for a soda factory. which was pretty cool considering they could pay for my school once had i been there another few years. but there attendance policy was insane. i went to work with the stomach virus and they wouldn't let me go home. i had to quit working every twenty minutes either cause i had to shit or puke. they gave me hell about vomit on my uniform and my productivity being low. eventually i stormed out. 

i took a break when my sister died. she just turned 14 and hung herself. we had her stay at an asylum for a few years because she was determined clowns were out to get her and see seen them. it put so much stress on our family. my mom took up smoking and my dad began drinking jim beam more than usual. he got on disability after a forklift accident.

i took a job as a custodian for that mental institution. they knew me and they did do everything they could to help sis. i did spend a lot of time cleaning puke and poop.  poop was always smeared on the walls of rooms.

i definitely did see some horrific things. the worst thing i seen was an old woman chugging a fresh pot of coffee. it didn't even faze her. i've seen some cradle feces as it if were a baby. they gave me one rule and not to talk to a man at the end of the hall. his name was john.

johnny had a condition that he believed he was himself, satan, or a child at times. they showed me footage of him reading faulkner while sipping tea, him laughing in the floor playing with a ball, and he would sit there and wreck havoc. he convinced patients to kill themselves.

well i avoided him until recently. i was instructed to clean his room while he was strapped down. he wasn't allowed to see patients anymore for obvious reasons.

he had his eyes closed when i walked in and security followed me in. i cleaned up candy wrappers they snuck medicine in. cleaned the toilet. and set out a new pad to sleep on. security changed it later.

i turned around and he was sitting up. restraints off. he started talking like we probably would. security walked over 

""alright jon were going to leave now. no trouble needed.""

he stared in my eyes. ""the mind is a funny thing. when you think about your breathing, you have to make yourself breathe. when you think about your body moving, you have to make your body move. you can't think. same for blinking.""

""yeah that's strange ain't it.""

""your sisters mind was quite fun.""

my mouth dropped. according to his records he didn't get here until four years after her death.

""the clowns were real. and they know your name too. except they aren't clowns. some walk among us.""

i turn around and security smiled ear to ear. black pupils. ""hey john, what's your name again?"" they both started to laugh.

somehow i sprinted out fast enough. they didnt chase me.

9qaavk,"hi friends, i am hoping to get the perspectives of as many lgbtq people as i can",12.0,10.0,80.0,lgbt,"hello reddit,

long story short, i am a straight, cis-gender female and i try as hard as i can to be a good ally to the lgbtq+ communities. i was talking to a friend of mine about how we wish there were more young adult literature for lgbtq+ youth (similar to books like simon vs. the homosapien's agenda), and my friend suggested i write one, as i write all the time for fun. i thought this was a great idea, but i wanted to make sure i got as many opinions as possible from lgbtq+ individuals to ensure that i am not overstepping anything, speaking over people, etc. 

in that light, my friend and i created a survey that i am using to attempt to make sure my information is correct. i have posted the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlsfn1rqkxqr1vj5zbbpvufxki87gg7t-o71ip5yfulfraz9daq/viewform?usp=sf_link) \- i am really sorry if this kind of post is not welcome here, but i love reddit and have been able to get a wide range of viewpoints from people on here for my work before, and so i was hoping that some of you would be interested in taking this survey. 

thank you so much for your time!",75244.0,734.0,0.88,2018-10-22 07:12:02,CatherineConstance,0.0,0.0,17.0,1117.0,197.0,123,0,0.2,0.004651163,0.0,0.05116279,0.013953488,0.004651163,0.06511628,0.018604651,0.037209302,0.004651163,0.0,0.0,0.018604651,0.07906977,0.041860465,0.055813953,0.041860465,0.0,0.0,0.046511628,0.0,0.07906977,0.004651163,0.0,0.023255814,0.018604651,0.13488372,0.041860465,0.074418604,0.0,0.027906977000000003,0.023255814,0.0883721,0.0,0.004651163,0.004651163,0.0,0.009302326,0.041860465,0.0883721,0.018604651,0.5023255999999999,0.0,0.004651163,0.0,0.09767442,0.013953488,0.0,0.023255814,0.004651163,0.037209302,0.018604651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009302326,0.004651163,0.013953488,0.0,0.004651163,0.013953488,0.05116279,0.004651163,0.11627907,0.13953489,0.15348837,0.023255814,0.074418604,0.0,0.023255814,0.0,0.004651163,0.004651163,0.0,0.0,0.09767442,0.046511628,0.0,0.03255814,0.0,0.023255814,0.15813954,0.004651163,0.018604651,0.013953488,0

70azz1,uk ticket competition scam?,32.0,13.0,27.0,Metal,"i couldn't think of a better word for it than scam, it's not so much a scam but a little sneaky. 

last month, i entered a competition for a metal festival in birmingham that had alestorm headlining. didn't think too much about it, just entered on facebook. alestorm is my sisters favourite band, and i don't really like them. 

anyway, i won tickets! i looked into it, 6 tickets apparently, i'd never won anything in my life. i was shaking a little (yeah go on laugh at me, i feel silly anyway). so i look a little more and they want £10 a ticket booking fee. okay, i wasn't planning on spending £60 but i already told my sister i'd won and my parents wanted to go too. so i booked it. i mean, i never win anything and the fact that i won made it feel like i should appreciate it and just go. 

since then, i've seen about 20 different people post about winning the competition, and they keep deleting and renewing the facebook ad every time it gets so many comments. 

i feel quite duped. i looked into the tickets and the prices are only £40 for tickets with the fee. i impulse purchased because i felt i had won something. 

i don't know, are they literally selecting everyone who entered? has anyone else 'won'? is this something that everyone knows about except me? what is going on with this?

edit: if i lived nearby i would probably just go and not think too much of it, but we live 100 miles away and it's going to cost a fair bit for accommodation. they offered some ""vip"" rooms for ""reduced prices"" in the winner e-mail.

ah4gdd,tipping culture needs to be abolished.,9.0,17.0,38.0,unpopularopinion,"while tipping certainly isn't mandatory, it's definitely something that is expected whenever you go out somewhere to eat or drink. i understand that some waiters/waitresses make like $2 per hour depending on where you're from, but that doesn't mean you're obligated to throw them extra money for a job they chose when they could have applied to any fast-food joint and gotten paid the full minimum wage. where i live, waiters get paid the full wage, yet tipping is still expected because...well, i dunno. i hear the argument ''they provided you with a service, why not help them out?'' being thrown around a lot which i think is the most ludicrous argument that is uttered from only the most sanctimonious people, or just people with herd-mentality who do what is socially expected of them without question. 

i just want to ask these people...do you tip the cashier you scanned and bagged all your items and completed your transaction? she provided you with a service. do you tip the retail associate who assisted you with finding the product you were looking for? do you leave a tip for the fast-food worker who prepared your order? all of these people are living off of minimum wage and nobody expects them to be tipped. what separates these workers from waiters/waitresses, or hosts/hostesses? these jobs aren't any more laborious than the ones i listed above. there's nothing laborious about greeting you at the door, guiding you to the bathrooms, booking reservations, or serving to you food/drinks. 

if tipping waiters and hosts is considered a must, then i sure as hell hope you're also tipping the cashier at walmart who bagged your items or the mcdonald's worker who made your coffee, fries, and big mac. once tipping is considered a must-do, and you're regarded as a monster if you choose not to partake, tipping culture is no longer an act of kindness but rather pity charity work. people won't bat an eye if you walk by a homeless person without tossing him a couple dollars but will put you on par with satan if you choose not to leave a tip.

aiuusk,being a cop is tough,28.0,7.0,20.0,nosleep,"yeah, i've been a cop for nashville, tennessee the past twenty three years come tomorrow. i have seen a lot of messed up stuff. i usually just deal with drunk tourist but there's a lot worse i've seen. i've dealt with people robbing homes, helped rape victims, dodged bullets. hell i just tried giving a guy a warning ticket for his tail light being out and he shot at me. luckily, i moved out of the way and had back up come asap. the guy had three pounds of heroin, a baggie full of hydrocodone, a dime bag of weed, about four thousand dollars rolled up, and of course a handgun that was not registered in his name. but i have seen worse....

i've had calls of people seeing ghost, answered a woman who screamed a black eyed child was on her doorstep, and a lot of other scary stuff. i haven't really seem anything though.

but back of last october i seen a pale man walking on the road. i just left the local doughnut shop (go ahead and laugh.) but the man was well dressed. black suit. green tie. and had a fedora on his head.

""son of a bitch probably is trying to be the next big star."" i said to myself. 

i figured i ought to pick him up and take him back to the station. the man was probably drunk and we were on a rough side of town. i would have felt guilty pulling his body out of ditch.

i pull to the side of the road and get out. i motion for him to come here as he obliged.

""come on son. i'll take you to the station get you some hot coffee. you can sober up."" he got in the back seat with not problem.

""did you have a lot of liquor tonight son""

he replied in a rather whiney voice. ""what is liquor?""

i figured this guy was probably pulling my leg. this town is full of it. i just kinda laughed and started driving.

it was pretty cold outside actually but a peaceful drive. only another fifteen minutes away. i looked back and seen he was wearing sunglasses.

""you can take those off ya know. it's dark out here buddy.""

""i prefer they stay on.""

""what's your name?""

""i've been told martin.""

""ya like music, martin? we're in the capital of it all.""

""sure.""

i started playing some classic country and merle haggard came on. i started humming the song mama tried.

""whatcha think martin?""

""i like it. i will have to see him play.""

""he's been dead for a few years.""

the car got awkwardly quiet. we were only ten minutes away. i felt a terrible creeping presence. i've never had people stay this quiet that were intoxicated or high. 

""so what's your business in nashville? are you gonna be the next big star?""

""no"" he lit a cigarette. ""no smoking in the c-"" i shouted

""i'm here for my mission."" he took off his sun glasses and fedora. i looked in my mirror and seen he had black eyes and a third eye that was more human looking. he had an two antennas on the top of his head.

""sweet mother of mary!!"" i shouted while swerving

he snapped and the car was parked all the way at the station.

""my species plan on coming down here. we want to settle on this planet.""

""what the sam hill?"" 

""who's sam? is that your name? anyway. we won't kill those who resist. but those who don't will be placed in our camps and work us while we further plans.""

""camps?""

""there is much work sam. much work to do indeed. we need full cooperation. some will have to impregnate out female species and some of us will do the same to yours. we want to create a new of half man and half us. we need some to keep our buildings in order. and some will be slaves. some will help lead. we want this planet tovbe dominate.""

""why?"" i nervously gulped. ""we're they only planet with life?""

""silly humans. you have it all wrong. there's so much in space that you are unaware of. theres many planets. many indeed. we will set base here while we work to take on the others.""

i felt vomit creasing to my mouth and he started to snicker.

""come with us, sam. if you agree to come when we decide to pick you up. you won't be a slave.""

""why would i be a-""

""because you seem bigger than the average sized human. we would have you clean our ships. but i like you.""

he transported to the front of the seat and listened to me scream. i grabbed at my gun.

he put his cold hand over mine.

atkisa,i've been slowly finding out how much people lie on reddit,18.0,13.0,58.0,TrueOffMyChest,"i really liked a fairly popular poster so i always looked for their comments. but one day i saw them post about their mental health. they said they had 5 different mental illness diagnoses. and when i went deeper into their post history, i found all these different stories about abuse. abuse from friends, family, strangers, partners, etc. it all went way past the line of sounding believable when i put all the stories together, so i finally had to realize that they must've lied about everything.

so now when i see someone post a trauma story, i click on their account to find out more. 90% of the time, they're also posting all these outrageous stories that just don't add up. some people talk about their dramatic memories in every single comment they make.

i never knew people wanted attention that badly. you'd think they'd feel bad for tricking everyone in the comments to give advice and sympathy.",203.0,1950.0,0.89,2019-02-22 19:46:18,VisionGoku1,0.0,0.0,11.0,908.0,159.0,111,0,0.15723270000000003,0.031446543,0.0,0.050314464,0.0,0.0,0.006289308,0.0,0.06918239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050314464,0.10062893,0.056603774,0.031446543,0.025157232,0.0,0.03773585,0.0,0.044025157,0.018867925,0.0,0.006289308,0.062893085,0.17610063,0.025157232,0.062893085,0.0,0.025157232,0.006289308,0.050314464,0.006289308,0.006289308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805031,0.0754717,0.018867925,0.47169809999999995,0.018867925,0.018867925,0.006289308,0.062893085,0.0,0.0,0.056603774,0.018867925,0.056603774,0.012578616,0.0,0.006289308,0.018867925,0.012578616,0.044025157,0.0,0.0,0.025157232,0.044025157,0.012578616,0.006289308,0.13836478,0.11320755,0.19496855,0.056603774,0.16352202,0.0,0.006289308,0.006289308,0.0,0.018867925,0.0,0.0,0.22012578,0.056603774,0.0,0.018867925,0.06918239,0.06918239,0.15723270000000003,0.0,0.0,0.006289308,0

836m2a,[help!] how can i help my autistic cousin?,7.0,8.0,42.0,autism,"hello there! i'm currently babysitting my aunts child with mild autism. i was wondering what we can do in general to help him become more and more functional so it's no too late to reduce some of the less functional habits.

right now, he usually eats frozen pizza only except for a serving oatmeal in the morning, which we put all kinds of vitamins in to compensate. his day usually consists of watching english cartoons even though we live in sweden. he's a kind of happy and lovely kid that's joyful and can speak to a degree but i'm always scared that there are things that we can help him with right now that might not be possible in the future. i'm asking you all here if you know anything that has increased the functionality of your or if there's any proven diet/way to help him. i'll just ask some questions but please try to help aswell, we just want his best.

should i find a way to feed him another diet? if so, how? is there any ""meta"" diet for autism?

should i try to talk to him a lot to help him develop his language?

should i teach him basic morals and ethics that he won't understand is wrong?

should i give him another medium to spend his time with so he can develop himself more? examples: games/puzzles that can  benefit him?

thanks for helping him out! much love!

9d7k0i,my cousin was struck by a drunk driver,0.0,1.0,38.0,legaladvice,"tl;dr drunk driver hit my cousin. lawyer up or let insurance cover it? 

my cousin was hit by a drunk driver while entering her vehicle. her car was totalled and she went flying. she is doing alright in that she is alive, but she has a long road ahead of her in terms of recovery. 

my family seems to think her car insurance company is going to deal with the whole legal battle, but she has dental surgery, drugs, physio, lost wages and everything in between that i don't think they are considering. we are canadian, and don't often think about suing individuals, but i'm not sure we have a choice because she needs to recover and find a way to pay for her life while she does.

do we need to hire a personal injury lawyer or will car insurance cover all of it?

atkisa,i've been slowly finding out how much people lie on reddit,18.0,13.0,58.0,TrueOffMyChest,"i really liked a fairly popular poster so i always looked for their comments. but one day i saw them post about their mental health. they said they had 5 different mental illness diagnoses. and when i went deeper into their post history, i found all these different stories about abuse. abuse from friends, family, strangers, partners, etc. it all went way past the line of sounding believable when i put all the stories together, so i finally had to realize that they must've lied about everything.

so now when i see someone post a trauma story, i click on their account to find out more. 90% of the time, they're also posting all these outrageous stories that just don't add up. some people talk about their dramatic memories in every single comment they make.

i never knew people wanted attention that badly. you'd think they'd feel bad for tricking everyone in the comments to give advice and sympathy.",203.0,1950.0,0.89,2019-02-22 19:46:18,VisionGoku1,0.0,0.0,11.0,908.0,159.0,111,0,0.15723270000000003,0.031446543,0.0,0.050314464,0.0,0.0,0.006289308,0.0,0.06918239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050314464,0.10062893,0.056603774,0.031446543,0.025157232,0.0,0.03773585,0.0,0.044025157,0.018867925,0.0,0.006289308,0.062893085,0.17610063,0.025157232,0.062893085,0.0,0.025157232,0.006289308,0.050314464,0.006289308,0.006289308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805031,0.0754717,0.018867925,0.47169809999999995,0.018867925,0.018867925,0.006289308,0.062893085,0.0,0.0,0.056603774,0.018867925,0.056603774,0.012578616,0.0,0.006289308,0.018867925,0.012578616,0.044025157,0.0,0.0,0.025157232,0.044025157,0.012578616,0.006289308,0.13836478,0.11320755,0.19496855,0.056603774,0.16352202,0.0,0.006289308,0.006289308,0.0,0.018867925,0.0,0.0,0.22012578,0.056603774,0.0,0.018867925,0.06918239,0.06918239,0.15723270000000003,0.0,0.0,0.006289308,0

awscvv,haha my nmom who hasn't spoken to her sister in many months got her to speak to me on the phone about me being jobless.,1.0,1.0,119.0,raisedbynarcissists,"my aunty was not prepared to listen and i frankly don't tolerate that kind of shit for anyone. 

&#x200b;

what is more ironic is my nmom goes mental and forbids me to work if the job title is not up to her par haha. 

&#x200b;

eh but why did it get this bad? long story.

&#x200b;

specifically emotional abuse and now i have seen i was raped too but this was deeply suppressed. 

&#x200b;

it begins with childhood trauma, owning up to the fact that the last 20 years of seeing psychologists did jack shit. my 9 - 10 years of being on antidepressants which i struggle to get off fucken destroyed me and made me the lazy no good person i am today.

&#x200b;

however all of this could have of been avoided if the specialists were doing their fucken jobs. in the end i had adhd !!!!

&#x200b;

once i got the proper medication my parents fucken denied me from having as a child when the teachers made it known to them a few times there were behavioural issues with me i was able to unfuck myself !!!!

&#x200b;

i have been deeply self analysing myself and it has done wonders. my bipolar diagnosis and being told i have depression from a young age could be anything as far as i am concerned now as it is maybe learnt behaviour from a nut case narcisstic mom who decided to take on what her father started which was some deep abuse on anyone who is close. 

&#x200b;

every time i do something challenging and against something these psychs would say i get a piece of the picture or puzzle i had been longing for. 

&#x200b;

now that everything is documented too and is all on the table for my own eyes to see i can make sense of it properly as oppopsed to going to psychs and just yapping for 40 minutes then waiting a fortnight to yap again. this was never going to resolve shit for me.

&#x200b;

i have been able to access a lot of my repressed memories as i have began unpeeling layers of me. 

&#x200b;

i just want to own these memories and for them to be in front of me so that i can evaluate these incidents that have bothered me now as a grown adult at 34 and not 8 - \`10 when i was a child and maybe misinterpreted it etc...

&#x200b;

once i own all of this i can then bury it and never need to explore this past ever again.   


it also means all of this stress is lifted.

&#x200b;

further what is interesting is despite going to psychologists there was always going to be more i can admit to my ownself then to others. as it is there to protect me. how many years would i need to go to psychs to get to the bottom of this?  


$50,000 down the drain :(

&#x200b;

now my conscience is clear as fucken day light and i own me !!!

&#x200b;

as for the job i could get one whenever but this personal issue of mine is something i keep on dragging and needed to get to the bottom of so that i don't let it influence me ever again and so that i acknowledge that it is now in the past and i did everything i could with it and should be proud as i didn't hide from myself.

9v8pyo,"help, i spilled a cup of water on parent's macbook..",2.0,5.0,52.0,macbook,"i was watching some crummy t.v show and i spilled water onto the macbook. i instantly ran and grabbed a towel and turned the computer upside town (the computer had been turned off by myself during this time). i accidentally kept turning it on whilst i wiped the keyboard, and then i used a hairdryer and a vacuum which worked well. however, i turned it back on - which i now know i shouldn't have. i went onto a guest user as for when i would try to type the password random letters would appear. once on the guest user i opened notes and saw that the tab key, ,a, s, d, 1 had been affected. so i took the d key off - i was panicked! i tried to dry its insides but broke it. it's been on and off a few times as of when mum came. i told her to just leave it upside down. she said they won't repair the d key as the computer has water tabs (what?) that mean that when they see the water has affected the computers they won't repair it. is this true? any advice?

no jitters or anything, just calm. 

the only thing i need to break is the routine to go outside and have a cigarette and even when i take one there is no effect at all that i require.

theanine is what they should advertise for smokers to quit because this actually works.


edit: i guess i'm the only one since im beeing downvoted. works for me atleast. 
i crave it so much less with 400mg of theanine. if nothing else it's a good way to cut down and evetually quit.",334.0,513.0,0.54,2017-07-19 15:31:54,redditsmma,0.0,0.0,6.0,525.0,98.0,78,0,0.12244898,0.020408163,0.010204081,0.010204081,0.0,0.010204081,0.0,0.0,0.071428575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040816326,0.020408163,0.10204082,0.030612245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05102041,0.0,0.091836736,0.030612245,0.0,0.030612245,0.030612245,0.14285715,0.010204081,0.08163265,0.0,0.040816326,0.030612245,0.08163265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010204081,0.15306123,0.0,0.6122449000000001,0.020408163,0.0,0.0,0.091836736,0.0,0.020408163,0.010204081,0.020408163,0.071428575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020408163,0.030612245,0.010204081,0.0,0.0,0.020408163,0.0,0.020408163,0.010204081,0.10204082,0.13265306,0.1734694,0.030612245,0.091836736,0.0,0.030612245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010204081,0.040816326,0.0,0.040816326,0.010204081,0.020408163,0.19387755,0.0,0.040816326,0.0,0

axaak6,"aita for cutting through red carpets, film sets and fashion shoots on the streets of new york city when i'm late and they are on public streets/sidewalks/parks?",0.0,8.0,160.0,AmItheAsshole,"does it matter if somebody asks me not to?

does it matter if my office or house can only be accessed through the area that has been cut off? 

otherwise, i  have two frequently occurring examples when it wasn't blocking my apartment or office:

example 1: most frequently this occurs when i'm heading or leaving my best friend's house. for whatever reason fashion shows, award show red carpets and film/tv shoots keep happening in the area in front of her apartment building, and so i've accidentally cut through weird red carpets before trying to leave in a hurry (no one told me not too, and i was confused what was happening. but i didn't have time to figure out if there was a way to go around because i had somewhere to be.) ; so i charged through the chaos) and one film shoot, which the production assistant asked me to go a different way when trying to get to my friend's apartment, but there was no way around it to get in.

example 2: i  used to go to school in nyu, and they would always have film sets all over the washington square area, and production assistants blocking off spaces in the park or space by the west 4th station when they weren't even filming at the moment. so if i was running late for class (which i would be very late for if i took their proposed detour), i would just walk past the pa's with my headphones even though i knew they were trying to ask me to walk around the park.

several times, i've been yelled at by security guys. ironically  always in situations where they are blocking the only exit or entrance, and when no one told me to go around the set or fashion show paparazzi area to begin with. but i usually respond with ""sorry, i'm late,"" and keep walking. i feel like i might be an asshole, and i also feel like the entertainment and fashion industry are assholes for expecting people to change their lives for their commercial gain.",678.0,11.0,0.5,2019-03-04 20:13:55,conspicuous_error,0.0,0.0,27.0,1882.0,349.0,194,0,0.13753581,0.028653296,0.008595988,0.04011461,0.0,0.0,0.0028653296,0.014326648,0.028653296,0.0057306592,0.0057306592,0.0028653296,0.017191976,0.034383952999999995,0.08022922,0.034383952999999995,0.0,0.008595988,0.0028653296,0.048710603,0.0,0.09455588,0.008595988,0.0057306592,0.017191976,0.008595988,0.13753581,0.017191976,0.103151865,0.0,0.06303725,0.025787966000000002,0.034383952999999995,0.0028653296,0.0057306592,0.0028653296,0.0,0.008595988,0.05730659,0.09742121,0.0028653296,0.57020056,0.0028653296,0.0028653296,0.020057306,0.08309455,0.0057306592,0.0,0.014326648,0.028653296,0.031518622999999996,0.020057306,0.0057306592,0.0,0.034383952999999995,0.022922637000000003,0.022922637000000003,0.0,0.0,0.017191976,0.025787966000000002,0.011461318500000001,0.0057306592,0.106017195,0.14326647,0.14040114,0.008595988,0.18911175,0.0,0.020057306,0.0028653296,0.0028653296,0.017191976,0.0,0.0028653296,0.051575933,0.09169055,0.0057306592,0.05730659,0.020057306,0.06303725,0.18624642,0.0,0.031518622999999996,0.0,0
9fw4f2,"i want an intimate ""expensive"" wedding, he wants a massive ""cheap"" wedding. how do we choose?",17.0,28.0,93.0,weddingplanning,"we are in the beginning stages of planning and are getting a little overwhelmed at the cost of everything. 

i have a huge family and he has a whole pile of people who may as well be family. all in all, if we were to invite all of them, it would be 204 people. these are people who grew with us and raised us.

if we were to go with just our immediate families and our very closest friends, it would be 40 people (did i mention i have a big family?)

anyways, my guy and i are struggling with that. we can either throw an amazing party for 40 people for around $10k or we can have all of our loved ones celebrate with us with a shitty party for $20k.

i'm leaning towards the intimate wedding because it feels more like us and he's leaning more towards the big bash because he thinks we can do it on the cheap by making it into a potluck or just have someone on a bbq flipping costco burgers (i'm not down for that).

how do we find the compromise? there is no in between. there is only 40 or 204 because of the whole ""we can't invite them and not them"" thing. we could easily invite 300+ people if money were no issue, but we aren't comfortable with footing that bill.

70jauo,"apparently, i'm rude for making sure my 4 week old doesn't get sick.",556.0,36.0,68.0,JUSTNOMIL,"sorry for formatting, typing this up on mobile with a baby attached to my tits. this is long so...
tl:dr-mil invited people to my house without asking and then got upset because i kept myself and my child away from everyone, including a sick 4yr old.

surprisingly, isn't about cotten-eye-no! this is about my mil, who i usually have no problems with besides a few bec moments. i've called her charo since day one, the lady is hispanic, never shuts up and talks a mile a minute.

for those who don't know, charo lives with me. she stays to herself, a good help around the house. she doesn't really do anything to qualify as a jnmil, she just annoys me with little things like never shutting up, buys things we already have in the kitchen (why do i need two jars of unopened mayo, charo??) she does a lot of business in florida, where she's lived for the last 20something years so she knows quite a few people down there. well, she was in miami for a couple weeks, doing her thing right before irma hit. the day before she's supposed to be back, she tells hubs that she's bringing family friend(ff) and her three girls (g1 who is 12,g2 who is 10, g3 who is 4) back with her to outrun the hurricane. okay, i wish she had asked but i'm not going to say no, they have nowhere else to go. lo ain't had his shots yet, so we have to be careful around the kids, especially the youngest one. i tell hubs this, he says no problem, just keep him away from them. okay, cool. to me, that means locking myself and lo up in my bedroom because that's the only room the kids ain't allowed to be in. 

now, i find out, that a high school friend(hf) of hubs is also gonna stay with us. hf has family in a town over, but they don't have internet because they're old. no problem, what's one more person?  come on over. 

before i get to the main point of this post, i'm gonna bitch about some other stuff. on to the bullets!

•the oldest two kids camped out in my tv room during their stay. we found half eaten food in the couch, panties on the floor and drinks spilled without even an attempt to be cleaned. neither charo nor ff felt it necessary to correct the kids. 

•g2 would not leave lo(when i actually came downstairs) or my animals alone, despite me telling her to do so. charo nor ff thought to make her stop. 

•charo and ff would take off and leave g1 and g2 at my house without asking if i would watch them. i don't know these kids, this is my house. i'll watch them, just ask me first. 

•g3 would constantly scream, she's scared of dogs. i have two pups. not her fault, 4yr olds are gonna scream when scared. charo and ff, again, did nothing but let her scream.

now, onto the point of this post! g3 had a cold(one that she eventually gave my husband). good thing i've decided to lock me and lo in the room! i'm not trying to deal with a 4 week old baby with a cold, i'm barely sleeping as it is. i only come down for meals and to talk to hf a bit. usually i bring lo with me and just don't put him down and stay in a different room from the kids. a few days pass, hurricane threat is over, ff and the kids leave, charo goes out shopping. my house is quiet for once. so me, lo and hf chill out in the tv room, watch narcos and talk. this is how i find out i'm rude. 

hf-""i remember that charo used to talk a lot, but i didn't know she talked so much shit!""

me-""what do you mean?"" 

hf-""well, to be honest, she talked about you. said you were rude for not coming down much and keeping the baby with you.""

me-""ah, well, i'd rather be rude than have lo get sick.""

hf-""yeah, i feel you."" and we continue watching narcos. 

i'm sorry, charo, that i quarantined myself and my child because he hasn't had shots and i don't want him to get sick. i really don't care.",13190.0,33305.0,0.98,2017-09-16 23:48:15,dixiegal_gonewild,0.0,0.0,13.0,3756.0,728.0,381,0,0.23450135,0.03908356,0.0013477089,0.071428575,0.010781671000000001,0.006738544399999999,0.005390835500000001,0.016172506,0.06469002,0.005390835500000001,0.013477089,0.0,0.0026954177,0.047169812,0.06469002,0.045822102999999996,0.014824796999999999,0.009433961999999999,0.005390835500000001,0.056603774,0.006738544399999999,0.09973046,0.020215634,0.005390835500000001,0.013477089,0.010781671000000001,0.11320755,0.016172506,0.06199461,0.0,0.041778973999999997,0.017520215,0.057951484000000004,0.008086253,0.006738544399999999,0.03504043,0.0,0.01212938,0.03638814,0.14150943,0.0026954177,0.5808625,0.008086253,0.009433961999999999,0.020215634,0.074123986,0.018867925,0.006738544399999999,0.018867925,0.016172506,0.045822102999999996,0.008086253,0.009433961999999999,0.0040431265,0.028301887,0.043126684000000005,0.030997304,0.0040431265,0.005390835500000001,0.020215634,0.022911051,0.014824796999999999,0.02425876,0.1361186,0.14420485,0.1819407,0.014824796999999999,0.15768194,0.0,0.009433961999999999,0.009433961999999999,0.0040431265,0.006738544399999999,0.0013477089,0.04043127,0.12668464,0.08221024,0.0040431265,0.016172506,0.008086253,0.052560645999999996,0.19946092,0.006738544399999999,0.0040431265,0.006738544399999999,0

i love the enthusiasm of this team and the positive attitude. like they are genuinely excited about what they are discussing. it helps keep the listeners excited about it too. 

i feel like they discuss the story more too. obviously it's hard to discuss everything that happens, but they do a great job covering the whole story.

7cwui1,"3 months postpartum, here's what ive learned so far.",183.0,51.0,52.0,BabyBumps,"had my little boy back in august, he just hit 3 months old yesterday. for the rest of you first time mom's, let me tell you what i've learned so far. 

vaseline has been my best friend. put some on their butt after a diaper change, keeps the poo from sticking to them. making it easier to clean and helping prevent possible diaper rash. 

swaddle sacks are a godsend if you can't figure out how to keep their little arms from busting out of a swaddled blanket. i even have a couple that turn into regular sleep sacks for when he's done with the arm binding.

if you're breastfeeding, a feeding pillow(i have a boppy) is wonderful support. get the positioning right, and you can even use both of your hands for other things. works great for bottle feeding, too.

a car seat with a separate base. saved me all the hassle of unbuckling and rebuckling a car seat. i can just pop it off the base and carry the car seat in. not to mention, you don't worry as much about whether it's installed correctly. 

a bouncer. i didn't get anything fancy. just a cheap bouncer. i can take him with me all around the house and not wonder where i'm gonna set him. makes it easy to take him into the bathroom with me if i got to shower.

receiving blankets. tons of them. they're great for everything. burp cloths, swaddling, car seat covers, changing pad. i've used them for nearly everything. 

clamping high chair. i take it everywhere. no need to worry about if where you're going out to eat has a high chair or room for a stroller. i usually clip it to the inside of a booth, no worries about a high chair getting in the way of people passing by or a busy waiter. 

if you're bottle feeding, for all that is good, please get a bottle warmer. it saves you so much time and hassle, especially in the middle of the night. 

having a fussy baby who just won't sleep? put him in a swing, i was gifted a mamaroo and i wouldn't give it up for the world. it's saved me many nights. 

if you're planning on a vaginal birth, consider adult diapers. the giant overnight pads may not cut it for the after birth bleeding.

ladies, postpartum depression is real. it's serious. i spent some time in a mental health facility because my depression got way too serious. there's a difference between baby blues and ppd. if you think you may have it, talk to your ob, they'll tell you what you can do. message me, i'll talk to you, i'll listen. 
 

i'm sure i'm missing something else, this already has gotten too long. anyone has any questions, message me. i'll do my best to respond. 

edit: also, cradle cap happens! you haven't done anything wrong. i had a nurse while i was in the hospital tell me that cradle cap happens because parents don't wash their babys head. not true. it's just one of those things. i've found using regular old baby shampoo and one of these brushes helped get rid of it in about a week. https://www.amazon.com/dp/b011evxiie/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_d5zcab07mfc9h",13190.0,33305.0,0.98,2017-11-14 18:43:44,dixiegal_gonewild,0.0,0.0,9.0,2953.0,538.0,300,0,0.21376811,0.05253623,0.0018115942000000002,0.04347826,0.0,0.0018115942000000002,0.018115941,0.0036231884999999996,0.09057971,0.0018115942000000002,0.0,0.0,0.009057971,0.048913042999999996,0.05253623,0.04347826,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.0054347827,0.07608695,0.0,0.09963768,0.036231883,0.02173913,0.018115941,0.018115941,0.11231884,0.016304348,0.050724637,0.0,0.038043477,0.016304348,0.054347824,0.009057971,0.0054347827,0.0036231884999999996,0.0,0.018115941,0.032608695,0.13043478,0.0018115942000000002,0.5326086999999999,0.010869565,0.0018115942000000002,0.009057971,0.061594203,0.007246376999999999,0.007246376999999999,0.012681159,0.014492753999999998,0.05797101599999999,0.0018115942000000002,0.012681159,0.0036231884999999996,0.027173912,0.023550725,0.018115941,0.0054347827,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.007246376999999999,0.025362318,0.012681159,0.117753625,0.12137681,0.17572464,0.02173913,0.13768116,0.0,0.028985507999999997,0.0036231884999999996,0.0054347827,0.0,0.0036231884999999996,0.010869565,0.106884055,0.072463766,0.0018115942000000002,0.041666668,0.012681159,0.041666668,0.18115942,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.032608695,0
8gn7k2,my phone having major charging problems,2.0,0.0,39.0,AndroidQuestions,"htc on a9

rooted

  


my phone frankly had been a little bitch lately, excuse my french. so here's my slightly specific and strange issue:

  


charging from my portable battery causes my phone screen to be consistently on, i'm pretty sure it's because the charge is disconnecting and reconnecting every few seconds. my first rational thought was to replace my portable battery, i'm using an anker 20100mah portable charger, so i contacted their support and asked if i could get mine replaced, they sent me a new one, without asking for my old one back (anker is awesome). but using my new portable charger, i have the same problem. so now i'm, 99.9% sure my phone is the problem.

  


the weirder part is, when plugged into any outlet, these problems disappear, except for a slow charging.

  


now, i'm thinking of replacing the battery, but i'm wondering if there's some software solutions.

  


is there a way to keep my screen from waking up when plugging it in?

ahzti1,"addressing the dating profile posted by my mother, bribery with her hen's eggs and other rumors you may have heard about me.",140.0,25.0,124.0,HaveWeMet,"originally, i didn't intend to address this situation openly, as i never anticipated my *senile* mother's [dating advert for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/havewemet/comments/ahmf2d/after_an_unfavorable_amount_of_noncooperation_on/) to gain so much attention. 

after someone unexpectedly called me up and asked me out on a date, i knew that something must be up - especially seeing how i've never talked to this person before. *incidentally*, just days before, i taught my mother how to use a computer. so, i put two and two together and found her post. 

**if you're thinking about asking me out and/or proposing and impregnating me in hopes of getting 3-10 of my mother's hens eggs, please refrain from doing so.** 

i appreciate you trying to help my mom see her dream of me having my own kids come true, but i'm also just human and am only looking for sincere and genuine connections, not someone who is only talking to me after being bribed. *with eggs.*

thank you.

&#x200b;

*addition:* i've seen some wild claims and rumors about me following her post, so just to clarify:

1. ^(i didn't have my tubes tied (where did this even come from?))
2. ^(i'm currently not in a relationship (unless i'm unaware of it))
3. ^(i haven't expressed romantic interest in anyone recently but i am certainly open to the idea of being someone's partner. (i mean, don't we all just want love in the end?))
4. ^(there's been speculations about my sexuality. i support anyone on their journey to find love, but i've only ever been romantically attracted to men. maybe the future will bring something unexpected, who knows, but as of now i'm pretty sure that i'm straight... (to the sweet person that expressed interest in me, you know who you are: i am very flattered and have never read such caring and lovely words by anyone, thank you. i am sincerely sorry that i can't return your feelings and wish you all the best))
5. ^(i have never dated anyone just to steal their lunch money.) 

~~mom, if you ever post shit like that again, i'll take away your damn library card.~~ please ignore any further posts by my mother if she tries to find me a man again. she's very old and senile.

5rfrql,an idea for a new dead space type of game,5.0,7.0,41.0,DeadSpace,"i had actually thought of making a kind of fan made game set in the dead space universe, but will have completely different characters, new necromorphs and entirely new story altogether. the working title for this idea is ""made whole"" in reference to the unitologists and the marker itself saying ""make us whole"".

also the game would probably be in 1st person, seeing as re7 did so well in that department. there would be no hud, yet the ammo counter on the side of the weapons would stay the same.

7xj19f,the beatles is overrated,56.0,78.0,24.0,unpopularopinion,"i posted this earlier, but this time i'm going to elaborate on exactly *why* i think they're overrated. (note: i don't think their music is utter garbage. just overrated.)

while there's no denying that the beatles made a huge cultural impact and revolutionized music, none of this makes them the most talented band to have ever graced the planet. they're often glorified for their originality but they've been successfully sued three separate times for ripping off the music of other bands. even the new york time's put them on blast for ripping off other bands' sounds. fans act like every beatles song they crapped out was sent straight down from heaven. not all of their music consisted of poetic brilliance. for most of their career they adhered to a very pop-sounding and simplistic style; they steadily and consistently produced easy, simplistic, and repetitive songs and lyrics, rarely ever deviating from their accustomed tone and evolving. now i'm going to touch upon the band's musical talent as individuals. none of the beatles were exceptionally talented at music instruments. they were mediocre or slightly above average at best. yes, john lennon and paul mccartney could play the piano, but does anyone truly and whole-heatedly believe that either of them were ''the best guitar-players of all-time''? neither of them would even make it to the top 100 pianists of that century. would any of you care to argue that george harrison was on par with jimi hendrix, stevie ray vaughn, or van halen? 

the fact that they were the first mass-marketed band that garnered a massive fanbase does not automatically make them the best band of all time. yes, the beatles was the best band of the 60s; they were the first of their generation to bring forth the new, refreshing, and simplistic music style that they did, so of obviously they were going to be the best in that specific domain. there was hardly any competition at the time. had they emerged a decade later, they would've just been another band in the 70s, easily being outshined by some of the more great and talented bands of that era such as ac/dc, zeppelin, aerosmith, rush, etc. in terms of lyrical content, vocals, and overall musical talent, they certainly do not measure up to many of these classic 70s rock bands.

popularity, success, and cultural influence doesn't equate superiority in talent. there are far too many bands that completely blow the beatles out of the water if we're really juxtaposing musical dexterity and lyrical content. the beatles' were not an awful or untalented band. but if you truly examine their musical talent in all areas (vocals, writing, instruments) then you'll see that they're pretty average. the quality of their music does mirror the oversize of their fanbase and that's what makes their music overrated. many beatles fans act like cult objects wherein they think that everyone, no matter where you are from, *must* agree that the beatles was the best band of all time and that everyone should give them a great deal of respect and reverence. the beatles were just a mainstream teeny bop boy band from the 60s.",2866.0,11706.0,0.75,2018-02-14 18:05:01,cruelcherry,0.0,0.0,4.0,3120.0,527.0,292,0,0.17448406,0.039399624,0.0018761726000000002,0.052532833,0.009380863,0.0,0.009380863,0.007504690400000001,0.046904314,0.0037523452000000003,0.0,0.0037523452000000003,0.024390243,0.054409005,0.046904314,0.06566604,0.0018761726000000002,0.0018761726000000002,0.0,0.07129456,0.005628518000000001,0.08255159,0.0018761726000000002,0.0,0.015009381,0.03564728,0.12382739,0.033771105,0.056285176,0.0,0.03564728,0.015009381,0.05065666,0.0,0.0018761726000000002,0.0,0.0,0.009380863,0.045028143,0.060037524,0.0,0.5046904000000001,0.0,0.030018762,0.0,0.009380863,0.005628518000000001,0.0018761726000000002,0.009380863,0.005628518000000001,0.05065666,0.056285176,0.0018761726000000002,0.0018761726000000002,0.013133208,0.020637898000000002,0.0037523452000000003,0.0,0.0,0.007504690400000001,0.033771105,0.060037524,0.03564728,0.07317073,0.12382739,0.12382739,0.041275796000000003,0.11257035,0.0018761726000000002,0.018761726,0.0,0.0,0.0018761726000000002,0.0,0.0,0.11257035,0.052532833,0.0,0.028142588,0.054409005,0.046904314,0.12382739,0.0018761726000000002,0.013133208,0.007504690400000001,0

edit: for the trolls/discouraging people, literally any salary thread for new grads in this sub in the  past 5 years shows this can be done and is often done.  i'm fairly good at algos/leetcode and will be studying that a lot more m",1154.0,3805.0,0.21,2019-02-08 15:22:12,MMcDeer,0.0,0.0,16.0,777.0,135.0,98,0,0.13768116,0.028985507999999997,0.007246376999999999,0.036231883,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.014492753999999998,0.014492753999999998,0.02173913,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.0,0.028985507999999997,0.050724637,0.007246376999999999,0.028985507999999997,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.0,0.072463766,0.0,0.10144927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050724637,0.02173913,0.04347826,0.0,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.072463766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014492753999999998,0.036231883,0.13043478,0.0,0.45652175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06521739,0.0,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.007246376999999999,0.04347826,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.014492753999999998,0.014492753999999998,0.007246376999999999,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.0,0.014492753999999998,0.007246376999999999,0.02173913,0.0,0.06521739,0.13768116,0.10869565,0.06521739,0.17391305,0.0,0.036231883,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.0,0.028985507999999997,0.07971015,0.0,0.04347826,0.0,0.07971015,0.16666667,0.0,0.123188406,0.0,0
au0ojo,"going through a rough mental period, not sure how to approach parents",5.0,3.0,69.0,needadvice,"as mentioned in the title, i (20f) am going through a very hard time currently mental health wise. i’ve never been formally diagnosed and have never gone to a professional/doctor to seek help, but i have an eating disorder and suspect some form of depression and anxiety as well. i’m in my final year of college, studying history and english, and it’s all getting a bit too much for me to cope with. 

i’m in the final semester of the year, and my exams are in about 3 months. i’m completely run down with stress about everything, both academically and personally, and really don’t know how much more of it i can deal with. i really want to defer my exams for this semester, because i’m afraid of either failing or not getting the marks that i want. i’m afraid to approach my parents about it because i fear they won’t understand and will push me to complete them anyway. they pay for my fees and they pay for my accommodation (my college is away from home) which is why i’m wary of bringing it up. if i were to defer my exams it wouldn’t cost anything extra as the fees for the year have already been paid. i really want to go to a professional to try better myself, and if i were to defer i would get a job so i wouldn’t just be living off my parents for the year. i don’t feel like i have the time or energy to deal w my mental state as well as doing college, it’s a one or the other type situation im in. so either i defer and try deal w my issues or i continue w college and sideline my mental health until i’m finished. 

i’m really quite lost at the moment, and any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated.

ax9um2,name this fallacy,0.0,7.0,17.0,askphilosophy,"hi everyone, i had got myself into an argument, which is long since over, regarding an issue where a result has been attributed to an unfounded reason.

i’ll give a brief version:

-lady speaks at the un regarding climate change
-the un pledges 3 billion to fight climate change
conclusion drawn was that
-the lady speaking caused the un to donate 3 billion dollars.

my argument is that the un didn’t hear this lady talk and then got together after for drinks and said “geee she’s got a point. okay, 3 billion!”

they had already planned to do so.

anyway, that’s neither here nor there. what, if any, is the fallacy called where the result was not due to the stated premises? other than just being invalid.",2903.0,6644.0,0.5,2019-03-04 19:38:13,NotAlsoShabby,0.0,0.0,3.0,708.0,127.0,93,0,0.19685039,0.031496063,0.007874016,0.05511811,0.023622047,0.007874016,0.0,0.0,0.047244094,0.007874016,0.015748031000000003,0.0,0.007874016,0.023622047,0.062992126,0.031496063,0.023622047,0.023622047,0.0,0.11023622,0.007874016,0.11811024,0.007874016,0.0,0.062992126,0.007874016,0.1496063,0.023622047,0.047244094,0.0,0.062992126,0.007874016,0.062992126,0.0,0.0,0.031496063,0.007874016,0.015748031000000003,0.09448819,0.09448819,0.0,0.54330707,0.0,0.031496063,0.0,0.031496063,0.015748031000000003,0.007874016,0.015748031000000003,0.031496063,0.062992126,0.007874016,0.0,0.015748031000000003,0.023622047,0.031496063,0.023622047,0.0,0.0,0.047244094,0.031496063,0.007874016,0.007874016,0.047244094,0.11023622,0.11023622,0.007874016,0.12598425,0.0,0.023622047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007874016,0.14173229,0.062992126,0.0,0.015748031000000003,0.007874016,0.047244094,0.19685039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

i’m not sure if this is unique to my fc but in mine, production is based on unique asins and fast starts after breaks. so i found an aisle with a lot of unique asins that if i cycle count them really fast i get my production really high and fuck around for the rest of the week. when it comes to fast starts i just leave a count loaded in my scanner and don’t submit it until the very last minute before break.

apb1b9,"draw me for free! no? well, your art sucks and i hate it anyways!",156.0,19.0,65.0,ChoosingBeggars,"reading all of these art related stories reminded me of a particular story that has happened to me recently.

now, i don’t consider myself a professional artist. college art courses and a lot of free time have taught me a thing or two and i do consider my art skills to be somewhat decent. it’s one of the few things where i can shut off completely and just enjoy the process. recently, i started using my ipad to create digital art after only having worked on paper.

now, my best friend loves anime. it’s a style that i haven’t drawn in since my early high school weeb days - however, i was looking forward to surprising her with an anime-styled digital drawing of herself. just for context, my limited experience with digital art and my ipad as a canvas made the whole drawing process take a few hours. 

after sending the finished drawing to my now gleeful friend, she excitedly asked me if she could share it on her social media - which i didn’t mind. 

the whole thing really got me into drawing on my ipad and i began experimenting with a few styles - anime, cartoon, disney, you name it. nothing very serious and mainly just shutting off from every day stress and depression. 

queue cb. cb is a guy that i met online years ago and quite frankly, he left a salty taste in my mouth and we haven’t spoken since he lied about something major. a few days after my friend posted the picture and tagged me, we had the following conversation (translated from german) :

**cb** : hey, i saw your art of [my friends name] on instagram, do you have any more like that? i love anime. 

**me** : hi! didn’t expect to hear from you, haha. yeah, i actually drew myself as well, do you want to see?

**cb** : yes

*so, i send him the picture.*

**cb** : that’s awesome. i really want to have something similar as my profile picture for instagram, with my tattoos and everything. 

**me** : cool, good luck :)

**cb** : lol i guess i’ll have to be more direct then. i want you to draw me like that

**me** : it takes me a long time to create a drawing like that, i don’t have a lot of experience or the best equipment - i’m doing it all on my ipad. took me a couple of hours to make these.

**cb** : that’s fine

**me** : no, i mean that i’m not really up to it. sorry

**cb** : lmao, you drew [my friends name], too. it’ll be good practice for you. 

**me** : [my friends name] is my best friend and she didn’t demand me to draw it. that’s a little different and i’m working on another project right now anyways.

**cb** : dude, don’t be a grinch. anime isn’t that hard to draw.

**me** : so do it yourself? lol

**cb** : i enjoyed your style. just do it, i’ll share it on my page as well 

**me** : ... so i’ll get more people that i don’t speak to demanding free art because reasons? 

**cb** : lol mind your attitude. art is meant to be shared with others and enjoyed together 

*at this point, i’d like to mention that cb is a tattoo artist in training. it’s not like he’s oblivious to the world of art and he’s pretty good at drawing as well.*

**me** : tattoo’s are art, do you do them for free because art is meant to be shared and enjoyed together?

**cb** : that’s different, i do it professionally and you’re obviously a lot more arrogant than i remember. to be honest, it’s really not that good anyways and the fact that it took you hours to complete is laughable. i can see why we stopped talking and don’t want to repeat the mistake of messaging you again - i was nothing but nice to you and your attitude got you blocked. 



well, he didn’t block me and i can still see his stuff. maybe he’s waiting for one last reply or me falling to my knees and begging him to let me draw him. who knows, we’ll never find out.

a7uc2q,"honestly if you're anti-sjw, isn't rap music the best way to go?",0.0,65.0,64.0,KotakuInAction,"well to give my point, think about it. on one hand, rappers are some of the most aloof people on the planet. considering rap music is mostly a symbolism of black culture this gives you the protected class status, but also the same time when sjws and leftists have tried going after rap before, their momentum was weak against them(the 2007 oprah interview for example)

i love how it is so politically in-correct, it pisses both leftists and conservatives technically at the same time. attacking rappers doesn't always seem to succeed from either side.

rap culture goes big time against conservative values as well such as small government, religious fundamentalism, code of law, etc. is not just against liberal values as most people often overlook 

looking at it from a misguided point of course, it is basically the ultimate weapon against idenity politics if you go by the values it promotes and whatnot. 

honestly, while i think rap is usually too hostile and vulgar, i have no desire to shame people who enjoy the genre big time. why? because like i said it is the ultimate tool against idenity politics and the music sometimes  gives some very powerful, yet misguided messages anyways...

if you're against pc culture big time, then you shouldn't be too bothered by rap. i understand again the level of vulgarity and hostility the music has to offer, but just remember these are all messages about black culture if you look at them in a more emphasized manner.

but but but, before this goes down the crapper, i will just mention that at all costs i do not tolerate everything that rap music promotes of course.",368.0,1962.0,0.33,2018-12-20 06:29:11,Luciano700,0.0,0.0,12.0,1621.0,279.0,171,0,0.12811388,0.010676157,0.0,0.0569395,0.0035587188,0.0,0.0,0.007117437700000001,0.046263345,0.0035587188,0.0,0.0,0.017793594,0.07829182,0.081850536,0.06405694,0.010676157,0.021352312999999998,0.0035587188,0.06049822,0.0,0.06405694,0.014234875,0.007117437700000001,0.010676157,0.021352312999999998,0.14946619,0.046263345,0.085409254,0.0,0.06049822,0.017793594,0.085409254,0.0,0.0035587188,0.0,0.0035587188,0.010676157,0.014234875,0.09252669,0.0,0.5124555000000001,0.0035587188,0.03914591,0.0,0.02846975,0.014234875,0.0,0.021352312999999998,0.014234875,0.049822062,0.035587188,0.0,0.0035587188,0.014234875,0.017793594,0.02846975,0.0,0.007117437700000001,0.007117437700000001,0.0569395,0.035587188,0.053380784,0.0569395,0.13879004,0.10676157,0.03202847,0.14234875,0.007117437700000001,0.014234875,0.0035587188,0.0,0.014234875,0.0,0.0,0.10320285,0.06405694,0.0035587188,0.042704627,0.010676157,0.06405694,0.12455516,0.0,0.046263345,0.017793594,0
60k9w9,discontinuing cannabis brings on hypomania?,4.0,4.0,43.0,BipolarReddit,"first off, today is the six year anniversary of me being psychotic and since i consider that one of the most important days of my life, i name today psychosis day. happy psychosis day to those who have made any sort of change for the better in regards to this illness. 

for better or for worse i have been smoking cannabis for the last several years. there rarely goes a period of time more than a week that i don't smoke cannabis. several months ago, i discovered that by quitting cannabis for more than a week coupled with high levels of exercise (biking, hiking, weightlifting — sometimes all three in a day) brings on hypomania. a couple months later it happens again. i discontinued cannabis use about a week ago and began exercising intensely and lo and behold — i have had three days of hypomania. 

now, i love hypomania. while i can consistently be a lazy piece of shit while depressed and i lack motivation while at a baseline, hypomania has me feeling like i'm on some sort of natural adderall without most of the negatives, except impatience and some irritability. i'm up early and working hard. exercising a lot. lots of reading. tons of seeing the friends. seeing inherent beauty in the world. music sounds better, food tastes better, sex feels better — why smoke weed when hypomania feels better than weed? i'm on all my meds. and very rarely miss a dose. 

i'm gearing up for a crash but this is the third time i have been hypomanic (recently) and it has clearly been brought on by discontinuing cannabis and high levels of exercise. not one or the other, but both combined. 

provided i monitor myself and have others around me monitor me, is it okay to periodically quit weed and increase my levels of physical activity to bring on these bouts of hypomania? if anything, i am being more cautious by not using cannabis — a potent psychoactive. 

i'll certainly tell my psych. about this but what do you guys think? is this sustainable?",16652.0,12901.0,0.72,2017-03-21 02:01:49,sdraz,0.0,0.0,5.0,1953.0,348.0,200,0,0.13662791,0.017441861,0.0,0.037790697000000005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011627907,0.058139537000000005,0.011627907,0.0,0.0,0.034883723,0.069767445,0.034883723,0.05523256,0.0058139535,0.0029069766999999997,0.0058139535,0.06104651,0.0029069766999999997,0.07848837,0.046511628,0.0029069766999999997,0.020348838,0.011627907,0.12790698,0.05232558,0.06395349,0.0,0.04360465,0.0058139535,0.06395349,0.0,0.011627907,0.0,0.0,0.0029069766999999997,0.029069768,0.10755814,0.0058139535,0.5,0.023255814,0.0058139535,0.0,0.07848837,0.0058139535,0.014534884,0.020348838,0.011627907,0.049418606,0.017441861,0.0029069766999999997,0.0,0.020348838,0.014534884,0.020348838,0.0,0.0,0.020348838,0.034883723,0.034883723,0.014534884,0.08139535,0.14825581,0.13081396,0.05232558,0.18604651,0.0,0.017441861,0.008720931,0.0058139535,0.014534884,0.0029069766999999997,0.0,0.020348838,0.058139537000000005,0.0029069766999999997,0.040697675,0.0,0.10755814,0.14244185,0.0,0.008720931,0.0029069766999999997,0

need help deciding whether on getting a computer science degree, or double major with comp sci and comp engineering, or comp sci and electrical engineering.

then there’s electrical, i heard the work culture sucks for electrical engineers, etc. i might go into it or something but who knows. 

edit: i’d like to add that i want a life, so i really don’t want to work more then 40 hours a week and still make a decent living.

a7uc2q,"honestly if you're anti-sjw, isn't rap music the best way to go?",0.0,65.0,64.0,KotakuInAction,"well to give my point, think about it. on one hand, rappers are some of the most aloof people on the planet. considering rap music is mostly a symbolism of black culture this gives you the protected class status, but also the same time when sjws and leftists have tried going after rap before, their momentum was weak against them(the 2007 oprah interview for example)

i love how it is so politically in-correct, it pisses both leftists and conservatives technically at the same time. attacking rappers doesn't always seem to succeed from either side.

rap culture goes big time against conservative values as well such as small government, religious fundamentalism, code of law, etc. is not just against liberal values as most people often overlook 

looking at it from a misguided point of course, it is basically the ultimate weapon against idenity politics if you go by the values it promotes and whatnot. 

honestly, while i think rap is usually too hostile and vulgar, i have no desire to shame people who enjoy the genre big time. why? because like i said it is the ultimate tool against idenity politics and the music sometimes  gives some very powerful, yet misguided messages anyways...

if you're against pc culture big time, then you shouldn't be too bothered by rap. i understand again the level of vulgarity and hostility the music has to offer, but just remember these are all messages about black culture if you look at them in a more emphasized manner.

but but but, before this goes down the crapper, i will just mention that at all costs i do not tolerate everything that rap music promotes of course.",368.0,1962.0,0.33,2018-12-20 06:29:11,Luciano700,0.0,0.0,12.0,1621.0,279.0,171,0,0.12811388,0.010676157,0.0,0.0569395,0.0035587188,0.0,0.0,0.007117437700000001,0.046263345,0.0035587188,0.0,0.0,0.017793594,0.07829182,0.081850536,0.06405694,0.010676157,0.021352312999999998,0.0035587188,0.06049822,0.0,0.06405694,0.014234875,0.007117437700000001,0.010676157,0.021352312999999998,0.14946619,0.046263345,0.085409254,0.0,0.06049822,0.017793594,0.085409254,0.0,0.0035587188,0.0,0.0035587188,0.010676157,0.014234875,0.09252669,0.0,0.5124555000000001,0.0035587188,0.03914591,0.0,0.02846975,0.014234875,0.0,0.021352312999999998,0.014234875,0.049822062,0.035587188,0.0,0.0035587188,0.014234875,0.017793594,0.02846975,0.0,0.007117437700000001,0.007117437700000001,0.0569395,0.035587188,0.053380784,0.0569395,0.13879004,0.10676157,0.03202847,0.14234875,0.007117437700000001,0.014234875,0.0035587188,0.0,0.014234875,0.0,0.0,0.10320285,0.06405694,0.0035587188,0.042704627,0.010676157,0.06405694,0.12455516,0.0,0.046263345,0.017793594,0

so, this is what i commented on r/trans. as you can see, nothing rude, just my opinion on the article and court ruling, basically i think 14 is to young to transition medically, much less for the court to over rule the parents decision on the matter. not that it's to young to know, not that the parents shouldn't be referring to their kid by their pronouns or name of be seeking mental health professionals, just that it isn't right for a court of law to force parents to give their kids cross sex hormones. within minuets i was banned.

7cwui1,"3 months postpartum, here's what ive learned so far.",183.0,51.0,52.0,BabyBumps,"had my little boy back in august, he just hit 3 months old yesterday. for the rest of you first time mom's, let me tell you what i've learned so far. 

vaseline has been my best friend. put some on their butt after a diaper change, keeps the poo from sticking to them. making it easier to clean and helping prevent possible diaper rash. 

swaddle sacks are a godsend if you can't figure out how to keep their little arms from busting out of a swaddled blanket. i even have a couple that turn into regular sleep sacks for when he's done with the arm binding.

if you're breastfeeding, a feeding pillow(i have a boppy) is wonderful support. get the positioning right, and you can even use both of your hands for other things. works great for bottle feeding, too.

a car seat with a separate base. saved me all the hassle of unbuckling and rebuckling a car seat. i can just pop it off the base and carry the car seat in. not to mention, you don't worry as much about whether it's installed correctly. 

a bouncer. i didn't get anything fancy. just a cheap bouncer. i can take him with me all around the house and not wonder where i'm gonna set him. makes it easy to take him into the bathroom with me if i got to shower.

receiving blankets. tons of them. they're great for everything. burp cloths, swaddling, car seat covers, changing pad. i've used them for nearly everything. 

clamping high chair. i take it everywhere. no need to worry about if where you're going out to eat has a high chair or room for a stroller. i usually clip it to the inside of a booth, no worries about a high chair getting in the way of people passing by or a busy waiter. 

if you're bottle feeding, for all that is good, please get a bottle warmer. it saves you so much time and hassle, especially in the middle of the night. 

having a fussy baby who just won't sleep? put him in a swing, i was gifted a mamaroo and i wouldn't give it up for the world. it's saved me many nights. 

if you're planning on a vaginal birth, consider adult diapers. the giant overnight pads may not cut it for the after birth bleeding.

ladies, postpartum depression is real. it's serious. i spent some time in a mental health facility because my depression got way too serious. there's a difference between baby blues and ppd. if you think you may have it, talk to your ob, they'll tell you what you can do. message me, i'll talk to you, i'll listen. 
 

i'm sure i'm missing something else, this already has gotten too long. anyone has any questions, message me. i'll do my best to respond. 

edit: also, cradle cap happens! you haven't done anything wrong. i had a nurse while i was in the hospital tell me that cradle cap happens because parents don't wash their babys head. not true. it's just one of those things. i've found using regular old baby shampoo and one of these brushes helped get rid of it in about a week. https://www.amazon.com/dp/b011evxiie/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_d5zcab07mfc9h",13190.0,33305.0,0.98,2017-11-14 18:43:44,dixiegal_gonewild,0.0,0.0,9.0,2953.0,538.0,300,0,0.21376811,0.05253623,0.0018115942000000002,0.04347826,0.0,0.0018115942000000002,0.018115941,0.0036231884999999996,0.09057971,0.0018115942000000002,0.0,0.0,0.009057971,0.048913042999999996,0.05253623,0.04347826,0.007246376999999999,0.0,0.0054347827,0.07608695,0.0,0.09963768,0.036231883,0.02173913,0.018115941,0.018115941,0.11231884,0.016304348,0.050724637,0.0,0.038043477,0.016304348,0.054347824,0.009057971,0.0054347827,0.0036231884999999996,0.0,0.018115941,0.032608695,0.13043478,0.0018115942000000002,0.5326086999999999,0.010869565,0.0018115942000000002,0.009057971,0.061594203,0.007246376999999999,0.007246376999999999,0.012681159,0.014492753999999998,0.05797101599999999,0.0018115942000000002,0.012681159,0.0036231884999999996,0.027173912,0.023550725,0.018115941,0.0054347827,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.007246376999999999,0.025362318,0.012681159,0.117753625,0.12137681,0.17572464,0.02173913,0.13768116,0.0,0.028985507999999997,0.0036231884999999996,0.0054347827,0.0,0.0036231884999999996,0.010869565,0.106884055,0.072463766,0.0018115942000000002,0.041666668,0.012681159,0.041666668,0.18115942,0.0,0.007246376999999999,0.032608695,0

asxncv,i just realized that i was an anorexic,2.0,0.0,38.0,self,"i know i know it sounds stupid how you don't realize something like that, but hear me out.

as some of you may know since i've posted this story a few times, a few years ago i was manipulated and mentally abused and have struggled since in getting back to a state of ""normal"". things during that time were very foggy in my memory. today i remembered a day where i was eating lunch and only ate one apple that day. other people were begging me to eat more but i said no, i felt in control then. that's where the problem was. i come from a family of skinny people, but this was different. remembering that day allowed me to remember more of what happened that year, i lost almost 15 pounds while already severely underweight. it made me feel good, i wanted to get the numbers lower and now i see how wrong it was. i was starving myself, my body became malnourished but i wanted to be thinner. during the time i believed i was in control and thought everything was fine, but it wasn't. after i broke free from the abuse my body naturally regained the weight and then some, causing me to freak out, but i eventually came to terms with it. i know many anorexics have a hard time breaking the habits they built while starving themselves, for me it just clicked i guess.

these realizations came as a result of talking to one of my friends who also just happens to be post-anorexic as well. we were talking about doing a health kick before summer and talking about our diet plans. that's when everything from the past clicked. what a time to be alive. hopefully don't make the same mistakes again",1802.0,4174.0,1.0,2019-02-21 04:43:29,urboi_nookyt,0.0,0.0,8.0,1589.0,298.0,177,0,0.12374582,0.020066888999999997,0.0,0.036789298,0.0033444815999999996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05685619,0.0,0.006688963000000001,0.0,0.006688963000000001,0.07023411,0.06688963,0.05685619,0.013377926000000002,0.010033444499999999,0.0033444815999999996,0.05685619,0.0,0.08026755599999999,0.04682274,0.006688963000000001,0.040133777999999995,0.006688963000000001,0.16387960000000001,0.040133777999999995,0.08026755599999999,0.0033444815999999996,0.030100334,0.016722406999999998,0.06020067,0.0033444815999999996,0.013377926000000002,0.0,0.0,0.020066888999999997,0.10702341,0.09030101,0.0033444815999999996,0.5819398,0.016722406999999998,0.016722406999999998,0.0033444815999999996,0.10367893,0.006688963000000001,0.033444813999999996,0.050167225,0.026755853,0.08026755599999999,0.0033444815999999996,0.0,0.006688963000000001,0.010033444499999999,0.013377926000000002,0.040133777999999995,0.0,0.0033444815999999996,0.010033444499999999,0.033444813999999996,0.016722406999999998,0.02341137,0.12374582,0.13043478,0.20401338,0.02341137,0.14715719,0.0,0.010033444499999999,0.006688963000000001,0.010033444499999999,0.0033444815999999996,0.0,0.0,0.06354515,0.036789298,0.0033444815999999996,0.02341137,0.006688963000000001,0.10033445,0.2173913,0.006688963000000001,0.0,0.006688963000000001,0
a9d0jn,why do black conservatives obsessively moan and whine about rap music and never go after the root of the problem?,7.0,6.0,113.0,MGTOW,"don't get me wrong, i am not saying they're sjw-minded and nor think rapping about violence against women is cool, but a big talking point with black conservatives is how degrading rap culture is to women and is holding them back, yet these dipshits never seem to talk about the root cause of the problem which is black feminism and the absence of positive male empowerment figures... and not only that, but is the damn women who perpetuate the bad boys in the fucking first place smhhhhh

but nah let's just whine and bitch about how rap is sexist, homophobic, pro-violence, and not go after the real causes which are black feminism, the lack of fathers and the rise of the welfare state. holy shit, tupac and 50 cent are real black republicans, not these bandwagoners who are trying too hard to just sound white and please their white counterparts so bad...

don't get me wrong though, i totally have more appreciation for a black conservative than a liberal one, because they own more responsibility and logic than a black liberal, but it amazes me how they have the balls to call out rap culture and not go after the root of the problem. 

tupac had way more red pills than any other black conservatives today

my mom is trying to guilt me into having her at the hospital when i'm in labour and she is ignoring me every time i ask her if she's let my uncle know she'll be staying with them while she's in town.  she would be a great help, but i can't play favorites between my parents.

my dad is trying to guilt me into having him stay with us when the baby comes.  he would not be a help.  he is messy and takes energy away from me.  i love him dearly, but he's exhausting due to his untreated depression.

my step mom is trying to guilt me into having her come with three teenage boys, none of whom are vaccinated, and stay at my house the week of my due date because we live close to the mountains and she wants to go skiing over march break.  re: messy, loud, germy as hell and constant attention required... and seriously?  during my due date?

my fil is trying to guilt me into having his new gf meet the baby at the hospital.  i loved my mil, who passed away in a terrible accident two years ago and i don't know or care for this new woman, that i have met once.  she is good for him, so i support the relationship.  it doesn't mean i need her as a spectator when i'm passing massive clots and leaking from everywhere.

au8m90,i'm worried about hooking up with a guy who won't care if i get off,4.0,18.0,67.0,TrueOffMyChest,"i really don't want to be used for sex. but it's like it's impossible not to be. all i keep reading are horrible stories from women about this. some of them say they don't need to orgasm from sex to enjoy it, but that won't work for me. i've never masturbated and not orgasmed, and my previous bf always loved it when i got off.

&#x200b;

i've been trying for weeks to get a hookup, but i keep backing out. i don't particularly want another relationship right now. also on a hookup, i would definitely feel really jealous he got off and i didn't. it makes me feel...honestly, kind of broken. like it's proof that i shouldn't be having sex like this, because i'm not a man.

&#x200b;

my last worry is that he might really like that he used me for sex. like if i don't get off, he'll call me a whore and all that. i've seen guys brag about cumming too fast on purpose with their hookups...they think it's funny to humiliate her by not letting her cum or enjoy the sex at all. should i just fake orgasms?",203.0,1950.0,0.83,2019-02-24 16:51:19,VisionGoku1,0.0,0.0,15.0,1003.0,192.0,123,0,0.253886,0.08290155,0.0,0.03626943,0.0,0.0,0.020725388,0.0,0.098445594,0.005181347,0.0,0.010362694,0.015544041000000001,0.025906736,0.06735751,0.062176164000000006,0.031088082000000003,0.010362694,0.015544041000000001,0.025906736,0.0,0.12953368,0.06735751,0.015544041000000001,0.025906736,0.041450776,0.20725389,0.025906736,0.062176164000000006,0.0,0.06735751,0.041450776,0.07253886,0.0,0.010362694,0.015544041000000001,0.0,0.015544041000000001,0.041450776,0.16580309999999998,0.010362694,0.6217617,0.0,0.005181347,0.0,0.103626944,0.010362694,0.0,0.015544041000000001,0.005181347,0.07772021,0.0,0.03626943,0.0,0.005181347,0.062176164000000006,0.031088082000000003,0.005181347,0.0,0.0,0.020725388,0.031088082000000003,0.005181347,0.15025906,0.15025906,0.22797927,0.025906736,0.08290155,0.0,0.020725388,0.0,0.0,0.005181347,0.062176164000000006,0.025906736,0.098445594,0.041450776,0.005181347,0.031088082000000003,0.020725388,0.041450776,0.23834197,0.0,0.005181347,0.0,0

>a similar rationale was taught to members of greek life at my university. all fraternities/sororities had to attend a mock rape trial where we were taught 2 main points.

&#x200b;

>the first was that it was impossible to consent to sex with any alcohol or drugs in your system. any sexual relations that take place under the influence can be considered rape even if there was consent at the time of the act.

&#x200b;

>the second was that any type of persuasion after an initial no (even if its just assurance of discretion or non-sluttiness) that leads to a yes is considered rape

adl2rj,love poems in my mail?,129.0,4.0,22.0,HaveWeMet,"i’ve recently started receiving love letter and poems in my mail. to be honest, i’m 99% sure that they’re not meant for me, since i haven’t dated anyone in years and am not aware of what would have ignited this flame of passion in someone. 

here’s a small excerpt for the poet to recognize:


*your lips are sweet,*

*so tender to touch.*

*the rose color in your cheeks,*

*when you start to blush*

*the love i feel*

*has never been more strong.*

*to be parted from you,*

*my love, it is wrong.*

if these letters are from you, i’m just giving you a heads up that they’re ending up in my mailbox and possibly not reaching the person you obviously care for so deeply. i mean, don’t get me wrong, it feels really nice to receive them, but i’m pretty sure that they’re not meant for me.

8zmeta,things skeksis has done lately to bug the everlivin' daylights out of me.,52.0,12.0,73.0,JUSTNOMIL,"so a couple posts ago, i made a list of things that my mil, skeksis, does that bothers me. she doesn't often do any one thing that warrants a single post, they just all kinda add up until i'm sure i'm gonna challenge her to trial by stone.

* i have a tendency to let lo play with whatever he finds interesting, as long as it doesn't pose a danger to him, of course. skeksis, on the other-hand, will take said thing out of his sight or remove it from wherever he is playing(never out of his hands, we would fight if she did) and won't let him have it because ""she doesn't like him playing with it"". this has included a box that my cell phone came in, a pot( both of these because he likes to try and stick his feet in them), a rain stick( because he put it in his mouth and made himself gag, which he has done with his own hands and literally anything else you can give him) and a medicine bottle that was empty but i filled it with rice and made sure the cap was screwed on tightly(she just didn't like it).
* lo is in a weird stage where 10m clothes don't fit him and 12m are just *slightly* to big. nothing crazy like [vincent adultman](https://goo.gl/images/sgqija) or something, just that legs are maybe half an inch longer than he is? i came home from the gym yesterday to find my child crawling around his playarea sans footed onsie that i left him in. my house is cold, because i'm actually a yeti, and i have wooden floors. why is my child naked? ""he was tripping over his onsie, so i took it off of him"" okay, valid concern. but maybe he was tripping because he's just now learning to walk? regardless of what the reason was, if she took off his clothes, she should have at least put a different outfit on him along with some socks to keep his feet warm.
* she keeps buying outfits with the word ""brother"" on them for lo. ""best brother"" ""little brother"" ""big brother"" she says it's just because she likes the outfit itself, not necessarily what it says. okay, but i don't like it. i've put him in one that says ""big brother"" just because i needed lo to wear something while i did his laundry and my family thought i was trying to tell them that i was pregnant again. it also doesn't help that she has called him ""her baby"" before and that i've heard her refer to herself as mama(this could be a slip-up due to her being old and losing her mind) so i'm kinda petty about it.
* took a short 1.5hr road-trip with skeksis, lo and hubs this weekend. skeksis sat in the back with lo. lo is ready for a nap, he'll fall asleep on the road. she kept insisting that she needed a blanket to cover his car seat because there was too much light and it was keeping him awake. no, he doesn't. no, there's not. he has no trouble falling asleep when it's just me or hubs driving him around during the day and it's too damn hot to cover up his car seat. give him his chupón and leave him alone, he will go to sleep. sure enough, she gives him the passi and starts diddling on her phone and he's out.
* constantly complains about it being too cold in the house. yeah, i keep it cool in here because i'm a yeti, but never below 69'f(and that's pushing it, even for me.) go put on a pair of sweatpants or a sweater and shush.
* calls my son her ""prince"", i hate it. i think it's gross. my bff calls her husband her king and her son her prince and it makes me gag. if you're one of those people, you do you, i just don't like it.

that's all i can think of today. thanks for listening, llamas.",13190.0,33305.0,0.92,2018-07-17 19:05:19,dixiegal_gonewild,0.0,0.0,13.0,3481.0,680.0,353,0,0.22060958,0.047895502,0.0,0.04934688,0.0043541365,0.0,0.018867925,0.020319303,0.04934688,0.0043541365,0.026124817999999998,0.0,0.008708273,0.040638607,0.055152394,0.052249637,0.014513788,0.008708273,0.0,0.044992745,0.005805515,0.10159652,0.029027576,0.02322206,0.021770682000000003,0.013062408999999999,0.09869376,0.014513788,0.0754717,0.0,0.027576197,0.013062408999999999,0.05079826,0.017416546,0.013062408999999999,0.03773585,0.0,0.007256894,0.04644412,0.11030479,0.0014513788,0.5994195,0.0029027576,0.01161103,0.007256894,0.052249637,0.015965167,0.0014513788,0.01161103,0.01161103,0.07837445,0.010159652,0.07837445,0.0014513788,0.03338171,0.026124817999999998,0.021770682000000003,0.007256894,0.0,0.010159652,0.029027576,0.030478954,0.018867925,0.16255443,0.11756168,0.24092889,0.014513788,0.13352685,0.0,0.008708273,0.005805515,0.0043541365,0.0043541365,0.0043541365,0.09724238,0.16545719,0.069666184,0.0029027576,0.027576197,0.005805515,0.030478954,0.18432511,0.0014513788,0.005805515,0.005805515,0

9d7k0i,my cousin was struck by a drunk driver,0.0,1.0,38.0,legaladvice,"tl;dr drunk driver hit my cousin. lawyer up or let insurance cover it? 

my cousin was hit by a drunk driver while entering her vehicle. her car was totalled and she went flying. she is doing alright in that she is alive, but she has a long road ahead of her in terms of recovery. 

my family seems to think her car insurance company is going to deal with the whole legal battle, but she has dental surgery, drugs, physio, lost wages and everything in between that i don't think they are considering. we are canadian, and don't often think about suing individuals, but i'm not sure we have a choice because she needs to recover and find a way to pay for her life while she does.

do we need to hire a personal injury lawyer or will car insurance cover all of it?

atkisa,i've been slowly finding out how much people lie on reddit,18.0,13.0,58.0,TrueOffMyChest,"i really liked a fairly popular poster so i always looked for their comments. but one day i saw them post about their mental health. they said they had 5 different mental illness diagnoses. and when i went deeper into their post history, i found all these different stories about abuse. abuse from friends, family, strangers, partners, etc. it all went way past the line of sounding believable when i put all the stories together, so i finally had to realize that they must've lied about everything.

so now when i see someone post a trauma story, i click on their account to find out more. 90% of the time, they're also posting all these outrageous stories that just don't add up. some people talk about their dramatic memories in every single comment they make.

i never knew people wanted attention that badly. you'd think they'd feel bad for tricking everyone in the comments to give advice and sympathy.",203.0,1950.0,0.89,2019-02-22 19:46:18,VisionGoku1,0.0,0.0,11.0,908.0,159.0,111,0,0.15723270000000003,0.031446543,0.0,0.050314464,0.0,0.0,0.006289308,0.0,0.06918239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050314464,0.10062893,0.056603774,0.031446543,0.025157232,0.0,0.03773585,0.0,0.044025157,0.018867925,0.0,0.006289308,0.062893085,0.17610063,0.025157232,0.062893085,0.0,0.025157232,0.006289308,0.050314464,0.006289308,0.006289308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805031,0.0754717,0.018867925,0.47169809999999995,0.018867925,0.018867925,0.006289308,0.062893085,0.0,0.0,0.056603774,0.018867925,0.056603774,0.012578616,0.0,0.006289308,0.018867925,0.012578616,0.044025157,0.0,0.0,0.025157232,0.044025157,0.012578616,0.006289308,0.13836478,0.11320755,0.19496855,0.056603774,0.16352202,0.0,0.006289308,0.006289308,0.0,0.018867925,0.0,0.0,0.22012578,0.056603774,0.0,0.018867925,0.06918239,0.06918239,0.15723270000000003,0.0,0.0,0.006289308,0
81f1md,people trying to guilt me into things vent,94.0,14.0,42.0,BabyBumps,"let me preface this by saying that i am continuously setting boundaries and am being mostly successful.  due to being the youngest, and a mostly passive person, my boundaries aren't always being heard with receptive ears.  i just need to vent in a safe place.

my mom is trying to guilt me into having her at the hospital when i'm in labour and she is ignoring me every time i ask her if she's let my uncle know she'll be staying with them while she's in town.  she would be a great help, but i can't play favorites between my parents.

my dad is trying to guilt me into having him stay with us when the baby comes.  he would not be a help.  he is messy and takes energy away from me.  i love him dearly, but he's exhausting due to his untreated depression.

my step mom is trying to guilt me into having her come with three teenage boys, none of whom are vaccinated, and stay at my house the week of my due date because we live close to the mountains and she wants to go skiing over march break.  re: messy, loud, germy as hell and constant attention required... and seriously?  during my due date?

my fil is trying to guilt me into having his new gf meet the baby at the hospital.  i loved my mil, who passed away in a terrible accident two years ago and i don't know or care for this new woman, that i have met once.  she is good for him, so i support the relationship.  it doesn't mean i need her as a spectator when i'm passing massive clots and leaking from everywhere.

836m2a,[help!] how can i help my autistic cousin?,7.0,8.0,42.0,autism,"hello there! i'm currently babysitting my aunts child with mild autism. i was wondering what we can do in general to help him become more and more functional so it's no too late to reduce some of the less functional habits.

right now, he usually eats frozen pizza only except for a serving oatmeal in the morning, which we put all kinds of vitamins in to compensate. his day usually consists of watching english cartoons even though we live in sweden. he's a kind of happy and lovely kid that's joyful and can speak to a degree but i'm always scared that there are things that we can help him with right now that might not be possible in the future. i'm asking you all here if you know anything that has increased the functionality of your or if there's any proven diet/way to help him. i'll just ask some questions but please try to help aswell, we just want his best.

should i find a way to feed him another diet? if so, how? is there any ""meta"" diet for autism?

should i try to talk to him a lot to help him develop his language?

should i teach him basic morals and ethics that he won't understand is wrong?

should i give him another medium to spend his time with so he can develop himself more? examples: games/puzzles that can  benefit him?

thanks for helping him out! much love!

algkh5,any advice for nighttime binging?,0.0,8.0,33.0,loseit,"ok so a little backstory first: i'm a 6'1"" 26 year old guy who weighed 320lbs less than a year ago. i am now sitting at 202lbs. since last february i have been working out, and eating healthy. i lift weights 4 days a week, play basketball ever yday and do incline walking almost every day. i get around 90-150 minutes of exercise a day....

the last several months have been slow. i am still losing but it's been really slow. i get my exercise in every day, and eat good and keep my calories where i want them... except in the middle of the night. i wake up and almost sleep eat. i'm aware of it, but cant stop myself. it's usually healthier foods like oatmeal, string cheese, oatmeal squares cereal(i've had to stop buying this because i sleep eat it so much) or other stuff like that, but it adds up when i eat a 300 calorie bowl of cereal and 200 calories worth of string cheese in the night. last night we literally had no food so i went to the vending machine in my apartment and got flaming hot cheetos, gardettos and pop tarts. i ate all the gardettos, half the cheetos and one pop tart. i would never eat that crap during the day, but when i wake up hungry i have to eat....

could i be working out too much? i spend hours in the gym/court a day. usually at night before i go to bed too. the hunger i feel when i wakeup is equivalent to getting the munchies after you smoke bud...

any advice? i haven't gained weight, but my progression has really slowed.

my mom gave me a ride to my ob appointment. i was having an ultrasound and she asked if she could come back with me to see. nope, dh and i decided a while back that only him and i would be allowed to come back and see the baby ultrasounds. cue cbf and a silent ride to the doc. 

about 5 minutes before arriving at the office, she asks if i'm even gonna call her when i go into labor. wtf? yeah, someone will call you and let you know but only after i've been admitted, i don't need you hovering over me through the entire labor period. cue the wailing, ""why do you keep pushing me away? why can't i be there the whole time? mil will be there the whole time!"" well, mil kinda lives with me, so... (not to mention if i tell mil to leave me alone, she will) ""i want to be there! why won't you let me be there for you? i had my mom with me the whole time i was in labor, i want to be there!"" i told her nope, i could be in labor for 12hrs or 2, either way, i don't want people hanging around, asking me all kinda questions, i won't have the patience to deal with your bullshit. i'm about to push a human out of my kuka, i don't want anyone but dh around me. it's what i want, what i'm comfortable with. 
""but what about meeeee?""

at this point we arrived at the doctor and i just got out and went inside to check in. she sat in the car for a few minutes until it got too hot for her out there.

this is the same woman who got butthurt because i don't want her in the delivery room and when i told her that i won't be accepting any visitors for, at the very least, an hour after delivery, including family. because saying absolutely no visitors after going through the most strenuous event in my life, wanting time with my newborn and husband is clearly me trying to push her away. 

edit: i still need a name for her, something that expresses her victim complex, something that screams ""everything is about me!"" any ideas?

need help deciding whether on getting a computer science degree, or double major with comp sci and comp engineering, or comp sci and electrical engineering.

i heard that comp engineering doesn’t have that many jobs, (most of the jobs are in software) but i love hardware. i also love software as well, i love coding but i don’t see myself doing that 8 hours per day 5 days a week.

then there’s electrical, i heard the work culture sucks for electrical engineers, etc. i might go into it or something but who knows. 

edit: i’d like to add that i want a life, so i really don’t want to work more then 40 hours a week and still make a decent living.

considering that a human being is completely “tied” to the brain which controls everything in our body (movement, speech, right or wrong concepts, behavior treats) how can a ghost, that lacks this very core, can move, talk, open door/windows, have the concept of right or wrong (wanting to hurt/help people) and other human like traits that are controlled by a brain?

i know it’s considered a supernatural thing, but is there a logical/scientific explanation that can be attributed to the concept of ghosts?

avhawe,could jeremiah and jerome have been switching places all this time?,15.0,8.0,67.0,Gotham,"i saw someone have this theory, and it does sound possible. they didn't have much evidence, so does anyone have any evidence for why this could be true?

&#x200b;

my small points:

&#x200b;

i think it's interesting how jeremiah is so obsessed with bruce being his brother, almost like he's used to working in a brotherly duo.

&#x200b;

or if you look at the interrogation scene in season 1 and how jerome acts...he doesn't act like someone who grew up on the street and part of a circus with extremely abusive and neglectful parents. he acts very similar to how jeremiah acts, at least for a few minutes. and it's strange that both twins are so obsessed with bruce. it's almost like they've both been involved with the wayne family for a long time somehow.

&#x200b;

jeremiah even said once that dr.lee was a close friend of bruce's, and everyone in the comments was wondering why he would think that since she and bruce barely interacted on screen. could jeremiah have had the wrong idea, because he was actually informed with the wrong details from jerome before his death?

&#x200b;

jeremiah says that he was already crazy and the gas did nothing...but since he spent all his time in the maze, what crazy things could he have done? it's not like he had a criminal reputation. gotham wasn't really in chaos until jerome came into the picture. what was jeremiah really doing in his spare time?",203.0,1950.0,0.94,2019-02-27 21:27:27,VisionGoku1,0.0,0.0,11.0,1399.0,246.0,151,0,0.21370968,0.04032258,0.0040322579999999995,0.028225806000000003,0.0,0.0,0.04032258,0.0,0.06451613,0.016129031999999998,0.0,0.02016129,0.0040322579999999995,0.044354837,0.076612905,0.044354837,0.024193548,0.0040322579999999995,0.008064515999999999,0.06048387,0.0,0.14112903,0.0,0.0,0.03629032,0.02016129,0.17741935,0.028225806000000003,0.076612905,0.0040322579999999995,0.03629032,0.02016129,0.048387095,0.016129031999999998,0.0,0.0040322579999999995,0.0,0.0,0.08467742,0.08064516,0.0040322579999999995,0.6008064999999999,0.0,0.012096774,0.0040322579999999995,0.012096774,0.0,0.0,0.028225806000000003,0.032258063999999996,0.076612905,0.0040322579999999995,0.06048387,0.0040322579999999995,0.008064515999999999,0.02016129,0.03629032,0.0,0.0,0.008064515999999999,0.028225806000000003,0.008064515999999999,0.012096774,0.08064516,0.13306452,0.15725806,0.032258063999999996,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.008064515999999999,0.0040322579999999995,0.016129031999999998,0.0,0.05645161,0.13306452,0.07258064,0.0,0.052419352999999995,0.008064515999999999,0.044354837,0.19354838,0.0,0.0040322579999999995,0.0040322579999999995,0
7u8hhj,how are we the racist bigots when...,26.0,6.0,36.0,The_Donald,"nearly all the black people at the state of the union wouldn't stand at all. a bunch of them didn't even come. because they hate trump. it doesn't matter what trump does, they hate him because he's a white conservative... in my book that's racism. 

the left is the only party that still cares about race and ethnicity because they see them as votes to get. you think they care about the dreamers? only as far as their vote goes. that's why it's hilarious how the left calls us racists because we want to secure our border, but they go and pander for as many minority votes as they can get. 

it feels so amazing watching my president stand in front of the world and declare americans as his first priority. he truly loves america!

i was blown away. this is gonna be one of the anime that i can proudly show to people when they ask ""you watch anime?""

yeah. i watch this.

highly recommended just for the visuals alone. the story seems promising as well. i hope there is romance involved as it is my favorite genre.

it was a relief to hear my doctor say the depression and addicitons i had in life was secondary due to my frustration of a non cohesive mind.

i'm just looking forward to functioning like an adult.  it took me 38 years to muster enough courage to do this.  now i hope it works.

in my world there are two dwarven kingdoms residing on opposite mountain ranges in an east to west spectrum of the continent. the two kingdoms are incredibly similar in culture excepting the language. the eastern dwarves worship the lighting god dalagog, but the western dwarves are a blank slate.

so my question is this: how could there be two separate kingdoms of very similar cultures on opposite ends of the continent? what caused them to divide? do the western dwarves serve a different deity? was there a cultural rift? give me your ideas!

amfsld,aita for being upset with my girl because she thinks i’m cheating.,0.0,10.0,66.0,AmItheAsshole,"so my girl and i have dates for five years and lately our relationship has been great. however, she’s had trust issues with me from the jump to where even if provided with no evidence she will act towards me like it actually happened.

it upsets me because she cheated when we were first started dating and i’ve had plenty of opportunities to get my revenge but i always chose not to because that’s not who i am. so the closes thing i’ve done to “cheating” was dming a celebrity and saying she’s gorgeous. just because it was my own inner self saying “got you” with out actually doing anything because i’d hate to hurt her. plus she’s told me celebrities she’s found attractive so it’s not that big of a deal. 

basically it seems like anytime i’m away from or with friends “i never prove to her she can trust me”. but i don’t get too drunk when i go out per her request. i avoid contact with females that find me attractive and overall i’m just a loyal as bf. but because “i don’t help her trust me”it’s my fault that she feels like this and i need to do more for her to trust me. personally i feel like i do enough for us to have been together for five years and me always be loyal to her and constantly have to tell her i’m loyal i think should be enough. so am i that asshole for being upset and thinking she’s always overreacts when it’s comes to her thinking i’m not loyal?",449.0,508.0,0.5,2019-02-02 18:46:56,GlassDanimalz,0.0,0.0,12.0,1379.0,266.0,150,0,0.14606741,0.06741573,0.0,0.0037453184000000002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041198503,0.0037453184000000002,0.029962547000000003,0.0,0.014981274,0.04494382,0.07116105,0.07865169,0.04868914,0.018726591,0.011235955,0.018726591,0.0,0.15355805,0.007490637,0.0037453184000000002,0.018726591,0.018726591,0.13483146,0.02247191,0.10861423,0.0,0.04494382,0.011235955,0.11985019,0.0,0.011235955,0.07116105,0.0,0.0037453184000000002,0.052434456,0.17228465,0.011235955,0.670412,0.0,0.007490637,0.0,0.123595506,0.007490637,0.0037453184000000002,0.037453182,0.018726591,0.059925094000000005,0.011235955,0.0037453184000000002,0.0,0.014981274,0.029962547000000003,0.037453182,0.0037453184000000002,0.0,0.011235955,0.018726591,0.041198503,0.018726591,0.20224719,0.13483146,0.26217228,0.007490637,0.10486891,0.0,0.02247191,0.02247191,0.0037453184000000002,0.0,0.0,0.06367041,0.15355805,0.029962547000000003,0.0037453184000000002,0.02247191,0.0,0.059925094000000005,0.23595506,0.011235955,0.0,0.0037453184000000002,0
a9yu4x,mr&mrs einstein and how i ruined our expensive vacations,71.0,16.0,56.0,JUSTNOFAMILY,"words like 'parent' give me the heebiejeebies these days, so let's call my progenitors 'mr and mrs einstein'. i've been nc for 6+ years so don't worry :)

previous episode: [https://www.reddit.com/r/justnofamily/comments/a4krii/mrmrs\_einstein\_and\_the\_navy\_blue\_wall\_aka\_karma/](https://www.reddit.com/r/justnofamily/comments/a4krii/mrmrs_einstein_and_the_navy_blue_wall_aka_karma/)

\---

i just remembered this ridiculous thing and i wanted to tell you about it. let me set the scene for you.

mr and mrs einstein were both from justno families, and even before the einsteins went nc with them they tried to avoid them as much as possible. because of this, every year we went on vacation the entire 2 weeks of the winter holidays. we were on some beach somewhere every winter, as far away from the justno as possible (*spoiler alert: they brought enough of their own justno along to last us through the winter*). this way, they wouldn't have to figure out christmas / newyears with either family, problem solved. at least, that's what we did until i was about 12.

so what happened? did the einsteins run out of money? *nope*. did their stinginess finally win out? *maybe, but that's not what they told me*. did they realise, having gone nc with mr e's side of the family a few years before, that the worst assholes were no longer part of the christmas equation, so maybe they wouldn't have to flee the country? now, that might've been reasonable, but again *not what they told me.* 

no, according to them, we didn't go on expensive vacations anymore because *we kids didn't appreciate it* \*pointed look at me, the sg\*.

so what was the problem? little primary school age me, and my 2 younger siblings, spent **so much time** hanging around our hotel room. \*more pointed looks at me\* hanging around, reading books (yeah that one was definitely meant for just me). all my siblings and i did was swim in the pool, read books, and play on our gameboys. you know maybe because we were all under 12??? and apparently, because i could read books at home, *i didn't appreciate our vacation.* 

i'm sorry karen, what did you want me to do??? plop my ass on a tourbus and see ya later? use my pocket money to go paragliding? ask out the hot bartender and have a good time? what do you want from me

shout out in the comments if you would thank the lord for a child who would just quietly read a book while you were chilling on a beach somewhere instead of running around like they're on meth.

avtlhk,i am (probably) about to be president of my universities pride alliance. any advice of suggestions?,8.0,2.0,99.0,asktransgender,"i go to a rather large state university, and i am not usually the gsa club type, but they needed a president and i can do it and i am passionate about trying to increase understanding of lgbt (mostly trans) people, so here we are. we meet once a week, the voting is tonight, and looking at my competition i am pretty sure i will win. i am trans and gay myself, so i am really excited at being on the executive board because i will be the first transgender president and i will be able to really help others.

anyways, what ativities would you like to see? what changes would you want to see? what do you think your gsa club is lacking? what do you like or dislike? 

i want to bring us out of the shadows. we keep the meeting times kinda secret, we don't table or advertise very much, we don't have a social media or anything of note to spread the word about us. i think we need to get a lot more open, i mean i am not going to force anyone to come out or anything, but in the area we are hate crimes are not really a worry, so i feel like keeping the meetings and more or less the clubs existance a secret is hurting not helping. i think tabling in the union at least twice a month to increase awareness and just allow people to ask questions would be a great thing to start doing. getting a social media and just saying like ""today we decorated cookies, look at these cute designs"" and just having a picture of those would be great.

we also very much have an atmosphere of ""i dont want to offend anyone"" in the room at all times. we ask first name and pronouns, but never get very personal in that regard. i think also asking for everyones identity in a way such as ""say your name and pronouns, and if you would like your identity"" would be great. we would specify on the first day or so that it is completely optional and you dont have to, and anyone is welcome in the club even if you are straight or questioning. nobody cares if it changes. it would just help take away that feeling of wanting to know but not wanting to ask that seems to be there. 

i also think that we should add a day to talk about mental health, especially autism. i am seeing more and more people in the lgbt community affected by autism and there is deffinetly a few in our group. talking about that and how it can affect sexuality and gender as well as things like depression or eating disorders i think would be a good thing. also i want to talk about the high rates of abuse and pedophillia in the lgbt community, we may not like it, but it is important.

lastly i want to start getting our local resources together. we have a little room they gave us (its really just a coat closet) but i want to get the local resources together so we know where to go and such, if the pride alliance isn't your place then there are other places to go. i want our weekly emails about out meetings to also include events about what is going on in the local community. that usually isn't a whole lot, but there are things. 

anyways let me know what you think or suggest! thank you!",8923.0,11594.0,0.92,2019-02-28 19:19:54,peterjmonday,0.0,0.0,16.0,3048.0,592.0,274,0,0.10641892,0.0067567569999999995,0.0,0.035472974,0.0,0.0033783784999999998,0.0,0.0067567569999999995,0.037162162,0.0067567569999999995,0.010135135,0.0,0.013513513999999999,0.04054054,0.08277027,0.0472973,0.06587838,0.0050675673,0.0016891892,0.06587838,0.0,0.10304054,0.010135135,0.0,0.013513513999999999,0.010135135,0.17905405,0.02195946,0.096283786,0.0,0.05912162,0.045608107,0.11486486,0.0,0.0050675673,0.0,0.0033783784999999998,0.013513513999999999,0.0050675673,0.16385135,0.0,0.6097973000000001,0.0016891892,0.0033783784999999998,0.0050675673,0.0472973,0.0067567569999999995,0.0033783784999999998,0.033783782000000005,0.013513513999999999,0.06081081,0.010135135,0.0,0.0,0.018581081,0.02364865,0.011824325,0.0016891892,0.0016891892,0.008445946,0.018581081,0.033783782000000005,0.02027027,0.10810811,0.11824324,0.16891892,0.025337837999999998,0.11824324,0.0,0.02195946,0.0016891892,0.0033783784999999998,0.010135135,0.0050675673,0.0,0.12837838,0.06587838,0.0,0.052364863,0.0033783784999999998,0.033783782000000005,0.2179054,0.035472974,0.016891891000000003,0.02195946,0

axaak6,"aita for cutting through red carpets, film sets and fashion shoots on the streets of new york city when i'm late and they are on public streets/sidewalks/parks?",0.0,8.0,160.0,AmItheAsshole,"does it matter if somebody asks me not to?

does it matter if my office or house can only be accessed through the area that has been cut off? 

otherwise, i  have two frequently occurring examples when it wasn't blocking my apartment or office:

example 1: most frequently this occurs when i'm heading or leaving my best friend's house. for whatever reason fashion shows, award show red carpets and film/tv shoots keep happening in the area in front of her apartment building, and so i've accidentally cut through weird red carpets before trying to leave in a hurry (no one told me not too, and i was confused what was happening. but i didn't have time to figure out if there was a way to go around because i had somewhere to be.) ; so i charged through the chaos) and one film shoot, which the production assistant asked me to go a different way when trying to get to my friend's apartment, but there was no way around it to get in.

example 2: i  used to go to school in nyu, and they would always have film sets all over the washington square area, and production assistants blocking off spaces in the park or space by the west 4th station when they weren't even filming at the moment. so if i was running late for class (which i would be very late for if i took their proposed detour), i would just walk past the pa's with my headphones even though i knew they were trying to ask me to walk around the park.

several times, i've been yelled at by security guys. ironically  always in situations where they are blocking the only exit or entrance, and when no one told me to go around the set or fashion show paparazzi area to begin with. but i usually respond with ""sorry, i'm late,"" and keep walking. i feel like i might be an asshole, and i also feel like the entertainment and fashion industry are assholes for expecting people to change their lives for their commercial gain.",678.0,11.0,0.5,2019-03-04 20:13:55,conspicuous_error,0.0,0.0,27.0,1882.0,349.0,194,0,0.13753581,0.028653296,0.008595988,0.04011461,0.0,0.0,0.0028653296,0.014326648,0.028653296,0.0057306592,0.0057306592,0.0028653296,0.017191976,0.034383952999999995,0.08022922,0.034383952999999995,0.0,0.008595988,0.0028653296,0.048710603,0.0,0.09455588,0.008595988,0.0057306592,0.017191976,0.008595988,0.13753581,0.017191976,0.103151865,0.0,0.06303725,0.025787966000000002,0.034383952999999995,0.0028653296,0.0057306592,0.0028653296,0.0,0.008595988,0.05730659,0.09742121,0.0028653296,0.57020056,0.0028653296,0.0028653296,0.020057306,0.08309455,0.0057306592,0.0,0.014326648,0.028653296,0.031518622999999996,0.020057306,0.0057306592,0.0,0.034383952999999995,0.022922637000000003,0.022922637000000003,0.0,0.0,0.017191976,0.025787966000000002,0.011461318500000001,0.0057306592,0.106017195,0.14326647,0.14040114,0.008595988,0.18911175,0.0,0.020057306,0.0028653296,0.0028653296,0.017191976,0.0,0.0028653296,0.051575933,0.09169055,0.0057306592,0.05730659,0.020057306,0.06303725,0.18624642,0.0,0.031518622999999996,0.0,0

aqzlm5,i discovered awhile ago that both my parents copy things they see on tv,2.0,1.0,71.0,TrueOffMyChest,"it's pretty weird...or is it common?

my father likes to steal movie lines and pretend like it was his idea or memory. one time he said my grandmother/his mother told him she hated him, and i saw the kid character from one of his favorite movies say the exact phrase he did. i looked the character up and he was the same age my father said he was in the ""memory."" mostly my dad just takes phrases from movies and acts like he thought of them himself. even when i show him the scenes, he refuses to admit he copied them word for word.

my mother has favorite youtubers, and she'll copy their whole sentences. like say the youtuber hates a star. my mom will say she hates the star too, using the exact same words that the youtuber did. she won't even change a single word.",203.0,1950.0,1.0,2019-02-15 20:30:51,VisionGoku1,0.0,0.0,14.0,770.0,147.0,91,0,0.15436241,0.020134227,0.0,0.026845637999999998,0.0,0.0,0.006711409399999999,0.0,0.08053691,0.006711409399999999,0.013422818999999999,0.0,0.0,0.046979867,0.040268455,0.060402684000000005,0.0,0.020134227,0.0,0.08053691,0.0,0.0738255,0.0,0.0,0.013422818999999999,0.013422818999999999,0.093959734,0.033557046,0.053691275,0.0,0.013422818999999999,0.0,0.040268455,0.046979867,0.0,0.053691275,0.0,0.020134227,0.0738255,0.0738255,0.0,0.53691274,0.0,0.033557046,0.0,0.060402684000000005,0.0,0.0,0.040268455,0.006711409399999999,0.026845637999999998,0.020134227,0.11409396,0.0,0.006711409399999999,0.006711409399999999,0.033557046,0.0,0.0,0.020134227,0.053691275,0.026845637999999998,0.026845637999999998,0.20134228,0.08053691,0.22818792,0.013422818999999999,0.046979867,0.0,0.013422818999999999,0.0,0.0,0.020134227,0.0,0.12080537,0.24832214,0.013422818999999999,0.0,0.026845637999999998,0.020134227,0.020134227,0.18120806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
atx98f,did any one find it sad that they had to look for alternative people in their life to be something of a family or mum or father role whilst their own were at home?,42.0,6.0,163.0,raisedbynarcissists,"a lot didn't make sense to me at the time but now definitely does at 34 and after being at a close friends wedding today.

i thanked his family who were ever so loving to me tonight and always had me over at theirs. then they would invite me for christmas, easter etc...then it clicked why i did this and emotionally i almost cried.

that genuinely means a lot to me as i saw that despite both parents being split. they could all function and my friend accepting he has 2 dad's. his real dad who he lives with and his step dad too who even did a speech at his wedding tonight as he is a great guy.

unfortunately my family would frown upon a family like this as they don't see the value. they just think they broke their shame by divorcing so they are not good people.

what is ironic the girl he was marrying also a friend of mine her parents are those type. both indirectly split 20 years ago. dad lives in granny flat back of house but when people are over they put on a fake front and pretend d everything is ok. then it is back to abusing kids and pretending.

so sad.

70azz1,uk ticket competition scam?,32.0,13.0,27.0,Metal,"i couldn't think of a better word for it than scam, it's not so much a scam but a little sneaky. 

last month, i entered a competition for a metal festival in birmingham that had alestorm headlining. didn't think too much about it, just entered on facebook. alestorm is my sisters favourite band, and i don't really like them. 

anyway, i won tickets! i looked into it, 6 tickets apparently, i'd never won anything in my life. i was shaking a little (yeah go on laugh at me, i feel silly anyway). so i look a little more and they want £10 a ticket booking fee. okay, i wasn't planning on spending £60 but i already told my sister i'd won and my parents wanted to go too. so i booked it. i mean, i never win anything and the fact that i won made it feel like i should appreciate it and just go. 

since then, i've seen about 20 different people post about winning the competition, and they keep deleting and renewing the facebook ad every time it gets so many comments. 

i feel quite duped. i looked into the tickets and the prices are only £40 for tickets with the fee. i impulse purchased because i felt i had won something. 

i don't know, are they literally selecting everyone who entered? has anyone else 'won'? is this something that everyone knows about except me? what is going on with this?

edit: if i lived nearby i would probably just go and not think too much of it, but we live 100 miles away and it's going to cost a fair bit for accommodation. they offered some ""vip"" rooms for ""reduced prices"" in the winner e-mail.

a7uc2q,"honestly if you're anti-sjw, isn't rap music the best way to go?",0.0,65.0,64.0,KotakuInAction,"well to give my point, think about it. on one hand, rappers are some of the most aloof people on the planet. considering rap music is mostly a symbolism of black culture this gives you the protected class status, but also the same time when sjws and leftists have tried going after rap before, their momentum was weak against them(the 2007 oprah interview for example)

i love how it is so politically in-correct, it pisses both leftists and conservatives technically at the same time. attacking rappers doesn't always seem to succeed from either side.

rap culture goes big time against conservative values as well such as small government, religious fundamentalism, code of law, etc. is not just against liberal values as most people often overlook 

looking at it from a misguided point of course, it is basically the ultimate weapon against idenity politics if you go by the values it promotes and whatnot. 

honestly, while i think rap is usually too hostile and vulgar, i have no desire to shame people who enjoy the genre big time. why? because like i said it is the ultimate tool against idenity politics and the music sometimes  gives some very powerful, yet misguided messages anyways...

if you're against pc culture big time, then you shouldn't be too bothered by rap. i understand again the level of vulgarity and hostility the music has to offer, but just remember these are all messages about black culture if you look at them in a more emphasized manner.

9vhuk1,i want to hear from you!,4.0,6.0,24.0,lgbt,"hello friends. i have posted a survey here a couple of times in the past few weeks (here's the [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlsfn1rqkxqr1vj5zbbpvufxki87gg7t-o71ip5yfulfraz9daq/viewform?usp=sf_link) if anyone wants to take it that hasn't). the purpose of the survey, and of this post, is to find out what people who are lgbtq+ want to see more of in literature representation-wise. i am a cis-het, white female, and i like to write for fun. a friend of mine told me they wanted to see more literature with lgbtq+ characters, and suggested i write a book to help make that happen. i loved that idea, and am now in the process of doing it. however, since i am straight and cis, i am trying to be very careful not to speak over anyone or step on any toes. that said, if you would take the survey, and/or share any experiences you've had and things you'd like to see more of in popular culture, that would be immensely helpful.

duration of complaint: month.

alright so i woke up one day about a month ago and it felt like something was very off with the first steps i took off my bed. i realized that i do not feel that my leg is ""there"" as much as my left leg. it's not on my skin but my muscles feel weak/not there. i thought i was making my mind up but the difference is 100% still there. secondly, i randomly dropped about 3 items everyday for that week. i had an overall weakness that week and thought it would be over but my grip strength is gone and my right leg still has lower feeling.  and some other side notes:
i cannot clench my fists anymore with strength.
fatigue
joint pain is common, i'm very inactive though.

i have a history of kidney pain whenever i exercise. was put in the hopital for extremely high creatinine levels after the excersises. still affects me today whenever i am dehydrated or i excert myself my kidneys hurt.

a78t51,i (m25) was just threatened by my gf's (f20) dad (m56) because he doesnt want me to see her,6.0,7.0,91.0,relationships,"my gf and i have been going out for almost a year. she is a college gymnast and student, and i work full time and am a student. she is black and i am white. 

she was a virgin, never done drugs or even drank and was very sheltered. she is really cool and fun and you wouldn't think she was sheltered, but because of how her father is and she went to a small private high school she didnt make many friends. i was the opposite. at the age of 16 i went from being an athlete to partying. i got into alcohol, and then drugs. by 17 i was a heroin addict. i used til i was 19. i went to treatment several times then got clean after i moved away. from there i got my life back i together. i stayed sober for a year before i started working and then i got my ged. i then got a better job working in medical manufacturing. it inspired me to go to school to become an engineer. math has always come easy to me and i loved the environment so i decided to pursue it. for the last three years i have been in school and am now at a university close to getting my bachelors done with. i am still with the manufacturing company because they treat me really well, work with my schedule and have given me a special position where i make really good money while i'm in school....

so i haven't drank or done drugs in over 6 years, have a great job, am almost done with school and for the last year i have been living very healthy and go to the gym almost daily....

her father is one of those really religious crazy parents and a crazy athlete parent. he has told her she cant date until shes done with medical school. she still lives at home because it's next to the university. she cant work because of her busy and demanding schedule with gymnastics and school, so she relies on her parents for money and stuff. i try to help her but she won't let me...

because of how her father is and because hes threatened her from dating she had to keep me a secret. her mother, sister(older doesnt live at home), brother(older doesnt live at home) and all her friends know about me though. her father has physically hurt her multiple times and she believes hes bipolar. he can go from a good dad to a violent asshole in a second. 

my gf and i are completely in love and everything was going amazing. her family supported us and everyone thought it was time to tell her father that she liked someone. 

she told her father several nights ago and he was happy for her. i was shook. he said he wanted to meet me and all that stuff. her mom has been supportive the whole time and was telling him how i seem like a good man. it was a huge relief that he now knew and accepted....

the next morning i wake up to multiple texts from my gf. basically he completely flipped the switch. a couple months ago my gfs sister did a background check and saw that i had a paraphernalia charge from 2011 on my record. the night my gf told her dad about us, she told her sister that she told her dad. i guess her sister, who acted like she supported us, called her dad and told him i was a ""druggy"". this is what caused her father to go insane. 

the whole family started fighting. her father went after my gf because she was defending me. her mom had to get between them so he didnt hurt her. my gf explained how it was something from my past and i am completely different now, but he didnt care. ge then started saying all these things he didnt like about me, and forbid her to see me... we are in love and she cant just stop seeing me. all we wanted was for him to give me the chance to meet him and then make up his decision. he said he would never meet me because i am never going to be a part of his family. he started calling me a perverted drug addict and demanded she told me to get lost. 

oh and he was also saying that because i was good looking that i wasn't actually a virgin. before i met my gf i was. up til i was 19 i had chances but never went through with them because when i was younger(12) an older girl pressured me into doing sexual stuff, and ever since then i had a horrible feeling of guilt every time i was about to have sex so i always backed out. which i'm glad of now. my gf was the first woman i didnt get this feeling with. we waited a few months before we had sex, but when we did i didnt get that feeling. i think it's because we are in love? anyway, he kept saying i was lying about that. he was attacking my character in every way.... he was also saying he would blow my head off if i didnt leave her alone. 

yesterday they kept fighting about it. i was on the phone with my gf and heard what her mom said:

mom: ""after what we learned yesterday i cant believe you feel the same:

gf: "" you cant judge someone based on stuff that happened more than 6 years ago. i fell in love with who he is now""

mom: ""oh yes you can. i thought you had higher standards""

gf: ""really mom? thanks! hes perfect now and you guys won't even give him a chance....""

it actually hurt hearing her mom say that. i had just bought her a couple christmas gifts the other day and was excited to give them to her. but my gf says those weren't her words and that her mom was also scared of her dad. 

just an hour ago my phone rang and it was my gfs house. i picked it up and said hello. it was her dad. he told me if i didnt leave her alone that her brothers would come after me, then just hung up. 

now idk what to do? i feel so bad for my gf because she has dealt with him her whole life and now she has to deal with this because of me. but we are so in love and we make eachother better. we want to be together forever. the plan was she would move in next fall, but now her father is saying i will never be a part of his family and he wants her to never talk to me. she is saying he doesnt matter and it's his loss if he doesnt want anything to do with her. she says we will always be together and if she loses her family because they won't even give me a chance than that's their loss.

i feel terrible. she has told me how her dad is but i always reminded her that it is her dad and i want them to have a good relationship. i told her we should live closer to her family because i want her to remain close to them, but now they want nothing to do with me. i just wish they knew how much i loved her and how i would never hurt her or do anything bad to her. i wish they could see me how i am now, but they won't give me a chance...

what should i do?

tl;dr my gfs father threatened me because he found out i did drugs when i was younger. even though i've been sober over 6 years he told my gf she cant see me. she told him she wouldn't stop and he went after her and threatened to blow my head off. he then called me tonight and threatened sending her brothers after me if i didnt leave her alone.

as pc digital gaming and public transportation rise, will both items become obsolete by then? how will retro cars and video games do in the near future?

836m2a,[help!] how can i help my autistic cousin?,7.0,8.0,42.0,autism,"hello there! i'm currently babysitting my aunts child with mild autism. i was wondering what we can do in general to help him become more and more functional so it's no too late to reduce some of the less functional habits.

right now, he usually eats frozen pizza only except for a serving oatmeal in the morning, which we put all kinds of vitamins in to compensate. his day usually consists of watching english cartoons even though we live in sweden. he's a kind of happy and lovely kid that's joyful and can speak to a degree but i'm always scared that there are things that we can help him with right now that might not be possible in the future. i'm asking you all here if you know anything that has increased the functionality of your or if there's any proven diet/way to help him. i'll just ask some questions but please try to help aswell, we just want his best.

should i find a way to feed him another diet? if so, how? is there any ""meta"" diet for autism?

should i try to talk to him a lot to help him develop his language?

should i teach him basic morals and ethics that he won't understand is wrong?

987uru,so i saw a doctor today after 38 years and he put me on meds,1.0,17.0,60.0,ADHD,"all i want to do now is start reading books and getting my life in order.  but i don't want to take on too much too fast.

it was a relief to hear my doctor say the depression and addicitons i had in life was secondary due to my frustration of a non cohesive mind.

i'm just looking forward to functioning like an adult.  it took me 38 years to muster enough courage to do this.  now i hope it works.  

edit:  i was tempted to start meds tonight but i will wait till morning.  i'm more excited to see how i will react and how it helps me.  i just want to absorb absorb absorb.

9xuvvg,overlord reminded me of the thing (1982),3.0,0.0,40.0,horror,"i need a second viewing of overlord because my first was ruined by my own expectations, i'm just glad i was able to recognize a fucking good movie.  what i expected was a fun romp with classic zombies, what i got instead was creature movie gold.  see the zombies in overlord are not really zombies in the traditional sense, they have more in common with mutants and monsters if that makes any sense.  

overlord is a slow burn with the backdrop being nazi occupied france in the middle of an invasion and it all fits together perfectly.  the nazi zombies are not a mindless horde to keep at bay but hit and miss experiments that sometimes retain their intelligence or are mindless beasts that will attack friend or foe alike.  the protagonists adapt to their situations very well with corporal ford stealing the show!  his cold persistence to get the job done is nothing more than movie magic. 

and the villain,  pilou asbaek, perfect for an ss nazi captain rapist.  my favorite line from that movie ""i'm going to win this one, corporal.""

9tftyg,bandit camp exploit!! be wary! i don't know how it works.,27.0,15.0,57.0,playrust,"players are able to kill you both are inside of the bandit camp, but they won't be shot by bandits. they can also loot you.

&#x200b;

in the main scrap building, there is the staircase where you can walk up/down stairs. we died multiple times in that room (and once outside of it) to the same players (i saw their name tag on death screen). minutes later, they were on the couch gambling without being shot at.

&#x200b;

huge exploit.

&#x200b;

they also called me a thot.

&#x200b;

edit: my buddy said that he saw the arrows coming from the air, like there is a place where you will be 'invisible' and you can shoot from. he said it was in a part of the building that was outside looking down that staircase.

aux3ur,i don’t have many friends or that “best friend” and it’s slowly making me depressed.,21.0,9.0,84.0,confessions,"my “best friend” was actually my girlfriend until we broke it off a few weeks ago, she was all i hung out with and we would do everything together.

i’m 19 but i talk to 0 of my high school buddies. i wouldn’t even call them “buddies”. i never really had that many friends in high school.

in college i have a couple friends, but they are just ordinary friends and i’m not really close with them (idk if i could be close with them)

i’ve been trying to make new friends but some people are either really mean or just aren’t interested in companionship. 

this loneliness of having no one to snap or text or hang out with on weekends is slowly getting to me. i used to be such a happy guy but each day that goes by i’m slowly starting to lose my mental toughness.

i’ve been having sleeping trouble for the past few years on and off, usually a few months of being incapable of falling/staying asleep followed by a month or two of a regular sleeping pattern, and then it returns to being unable to sleep again. for the past 6 months or so i’ve been incapable of sleeping. it takes me at least 5-6 hours after going to bed to finally fall asleep, and the rare time i do fall asleep quickly i can’t stay asleep for more than 3/4 hours at a time. i’ve tried everything i can think of to fix it but nothing has worked - i’ve tried regular exercise, changing my diet, cutting caffeine, staying out of bed during non sleeping times, staying away from phone/screens for an hour before trying to sleep. none of it has worked, anything that has helped at all quickly stops working after a few days and i’m back to square one again. on nights that i haven’t been able to sleep at all i’ve tried staying up all day so that i might sleep early that night and get back into a regular routine but i always end up waking up after about 3 hours anyway and am then awake all night again. 

last night i took a sleeping tablet (1mg of lormetazepam) to try get to sleep at a reasonable time but it never worked. this was my first time ever taking any sleep medication so it’s not due to a tolerance being built up. i felt somewhat drowsy about 30 minutes after taking the tablet but that wore off and i remained awake for hours, not falling asleep until about 7/8am as per usual.

what could be causing this?

7zbjk9,i need some help with itunes.,5.0,6.0,29.0,MoviesAnywhere,so i linked my movies anywhere to itunes a while ago. had all of them showing perfectly. then i noticed only a few movies showed up. so i did the logical thing and unlinked and relinked it. it didn't work. i then looked at my purchased movies. all of them were there. they weren't going to my library though. in the past when i had to unlink and relink itunes it didn't take long for all the movies to show up in the library. i had to individually download all of them to my library and they are still downloading. can anyone help me fix it so it just smoothly transfers all of the movies at once?,4013.0,1189.0,0.81,2018-02-22 04:52:00,TheGuyWhoLovesMovies,0.0,0.0,6.0,597.0,117.0,70,0,0.11965812,0.025641026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08547009,0.008547009,0.0,0.0,0.017094018,0.008547009,0.08547009,0.008547009,0.008547009,0.0,0.0,0.05982906,0.0,0.08547009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051282052,0.12820514,0.0,0.102564104,0.0,0.034188036,0.0,0.051282052,0.0,0.008547009,0.0,0.0,0.025641026,0.11111111,0.034188036,0.0,0.63247865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094017096,0.0,0.0,0.025641026,0.008547009,0.05982906,0.05982906,0.0,0.008547009,0.017094018,0.025641026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008547009,0.04273504400000001,0.008547009,0.025641026,0.13675214,0.14529915,0.1965812,0.051282052,0.16239317,0.0,0.017094018,0.0,0.0,0.034188036,0.0,0.0,0.06837607,0.07692308,0.0,0.017094018,0.04273504400000001,0.06837607,0.11965812,0.0,0.04273504400000001,0.0,0
8rbo9g,just an idea for the forsaken story missions,5.0,4.0,44.0,destiny2,"this may just be my own opinion or idea but who else would want to see the forsaken missions not allow you to be in a fireteam?
the reason i am asking this is mainly from what the trailer description gave us: ""beyond the vanguard’s authority, you’ll venture into the reef alone and take justice into your own hands.""
and since you were personally sent to accompany cayde and since he's the most liked character of destiny, it'd make sense to have it set as a somewhat ""personal"" journey to avenge his death.

8zmeta,things skeksis has done lately to bug the everlivin' daylights out of me.,52.0,12.0,73.0,JUSTNOMIL,"so a couple posts ago, i made a list of things that my mil, skeksis, does that bothers me. she doesn't often do any one thing that warrants a single post, they just all kinda add up until i'm sure i'm gonna challenge her to trial by stone.

* i have a tendency to let lo play with whatever he finds interesting, as long as it doesn't pose a danger to him, of course. skeksis, on the other-hand, will take said thing out of his sight or remove it from wherever he is playing(never out of his hands, we would fight if she did) and won't let him have it because ""she doesn't like him playing with it"". this has included a box that my cell phone came in, a pot( both of these because he likes to try and stick his feet in them), a rain stick( because he put it in his mouth and made himself gag, which he has done with his own hands and literally anything else you can give him) and a medicine bottle that was empty but i filled it with rice and made sure the cap was screwed on tightly(she just didn't like it).
* lo is in a weird stage where 10m clothes don't fit him and 12m are just *slightly* to big. nothing crazy like [vincent adultman](https://goo.gl/images/sgqija) or something, just that legs are maybe half an inch longer than he is? i came home from the gym yesterday to find my child crawling around his playarea sans footed onsie that i left him in. my house is cold, because i'm actually a yeti, and i have wooden floors. why is my child naked? ""he was tripping over his onsie, so i took it off of him"" okay, valid concern. but maybe he was tripping because he's just now learning to walk? regardless of what the reason was, if she took off his clothes, she should have at least put a different outfit on him along with some socks to keep his feet warm.
* she keeps buying outfits with the word ""brother"" on them for lo. ""best brother"" ""little brother"" ""big brother"" she says it's just because she likes the outfit itself, not necessarily what it says. okay, but i don't like it. i've put him in one that says ""big brother"" just because i needed lo to wear something while i did his laundry and my family thought i was trying to tell them that i was pregnant again. it also doesn't help that she has called him ""her baby"" before and that i've heard her refer to herself as mama(this could be a slip-up due to her being old and losing her mind) so i'm kinda petty about it.
* took a short 1.5hr road-trip with skeksis, lo and hubs this weekend. skeksis sat in the back with lo. lo is ready for a nap, he'll fall asleep on the road. she kept insisting that she needed a blanket to cover his car seat because there was too much light and it was keeping him awake. no, he doesn't. no, there's not. he has no trouble falling asleep when it's just me or hubs driving him around during the day and it's too damn hot to cover up his car seat. give him his chupón and leave him alone, he will go to sleep. sure enough, she gives him the passi and starts diddling on her phone and he's out.
* constantly complains about it being too cold in the house. yeah, i keep it cool in here because i'm a yeti, but never below 69'f(and that's pushing it, even for me.) go put on a pair of sweatpants or a sweater and shush.
* calls my son her ""prince"", i hate it. i think it's gross. my bff calls her husband her king and her son her prince and it makes me gag. if you're one of those people, you do you, i just don't like it.

that's all i can think of today. thanks for listening, llamas.",13190.0,33305.0,0.92,2018-07-17 19:05:19,dixiegal_gonewild,0.0,0.0,13.0,3481.0,680.0,353,0,0.22060958,0.047895502,0.0,0.04934688,0.0043541365,0.0,0.018867925,0.020319303,0.04934688,0.0043541365,0.026124817999999998,0.0,0.008708273,0.040638607,0.055152394,0.052249637,0.014513788,0.008708273,0.0,0.044992745,0.005805515,0.10159652,0.029027576,0.02322206,0.021770682000000003,0.013062408999999999,0.09869376,0.014513788,0.0754717,0.0,0.027576197,0.013062408999999999,0.05079826,0.017416546,0.013062408999999999,0.03773585,0.0,0.007256894,0.04644412,0.11030479,0.0014513788,0.5994195,0.0029027576,0.01161103,0.007256894,0.052249637,0.015965167,0.0014513788,0.01161103,0.01161103,0.07837445,0.010159652,0.07837445,0.0014513788,0.03338171,0.026124817999999998,0.021770682000000003,0.007256894,0.0,0.010159652,0.029027576,0.030478954,0.018867925,0.16255443,0.11756168,0.24092889,0.014513788,0.13352685,0.0,0.008708273,0.005805515,0.0043541365,0.0043541365,0.0043541365,0.09724238,0.16545719,0.069666184,0.0029027576,0.027576197,0.005805515,0.030478954,0.18432511,0.0014513788,0.005805515,0.005805515,0

previous episode: [https://www.reddit.com/r/justnomil/comments/aa9shh/mrs\_einstein\_and\_why\_i\_bounce\_my\_legs\_247/](https://www.reddit.com/r/justnomil/comments/aa9shh/mrs_einstein_and_why_i_bounce_my_legs_247/)

**tldr**: i have a high iq. this led to ridiculously high expectations which destroys my self-esteem. also their justno nickname is explained.

\---

this is the story of how the einsteins destroyed my self-esteem so thoroughly that more than a decade later there is still a gaping, bleeding hole where it used to be. prepare yourself for some next level mindfuckery.

when i was 10, i was sent to a child psychologist to be evaluated. you see, i was having trouble in school, not making friends, and generally being very unhappy. there was clearly something wrong. (spoiler alert: *autism is what was wrong.* didn't know that until i got myself diagnosed at 23 though...) after talking to me a few times, the shrink asked to see my younger siblings (for some context i guess?). and not long after that came the answer, and this was the moment that changed the einsteins narrative forever: i had ~~autism~~ an iq of 145. wait, what? yes, my inability to make friends was because i was simply too clever for them; and my inability to make homework or pay attention in school, well...they mostly forgot about that tbh. all the problems in my life were explained with the fact that i was simply too smart to deal with normies, and the best part was: it was not just me, *all of us* had ~~autism~~ iqs through the roof!

the einsteins latched onto this fact like you wouldn't believe. all of life's problems were explained! trouble getting along with family? ~~autism~~ intellectual differences. trouble getting along with coworkers? ~~autism~~ intellectual differences. trouble making friends in the neighborhood? ~~autism~~ intellectual differences. trouble in school? ~~autism~~ no discipline because we were too clever. (to be fair that last one is actually a thing, but being justno all they did about it was point it out and expect us to fix it ourselves?? or something??)

so, now you had two narcissists being validated in their superiority by having a psychologist tell them they and their offspring were all hella smart. (i never went back to that shrink by the way, because who needs them amirite?) and in the following years they managed to construct a narrative around this that just...completely destroyed me. let me lay it out for you (disclaimer: this is their belief, not mine) (also i say 'i', but this went for all of us):

i have an iq of 145. that's clearly way above the average. in fact, because of the way iq tests are made and calibrated, as you get above 130 or so they start to be inaccurate. it's like a toddler counting 1, 2, a lot. so because my iq was ""a lot"", it was immeasurable. because it was immeasurable, i might as well be the next da vinci or tesla or something. *(not einstein, because mr e thought the proverbial einstein was a fraud and hated the fact that all intelligent people were compared to einstein. also mr e thinks he's smarter than einstein. hence the nickname here on justno* 😁) the modern equivalent of being the next da vinci is winning a nobel prize. and because i *can* be the next da vinci and win a nobel prize, well...*why aren't i*? i clearly have the *potential*; why am i not living up to this potential? i must not want to. i must be unmotivated. i must be lazy.

mr e, himself, was clearly smarter than literally everyone around him (/s), but he was in his 40's when he found out. all those years of living the life of joe schmoe, taking care of his family, had wasted his *potential* and there was nothing he could do about it now. it wasn't his fault you guys! mrs e came from a traditional family that expected her to become an obedient housewife and nothing else. she had managed to get *some* education, but in the end they had held her back too much and wasted her *potential*. and oh yeah also she had babies and then became completely incapable of doing anything. so again, not her fault she amounted to ""nothing"" (because a mother isn't a thing apparently)!

but their *children*, young and so full of *potential*! they had to live up to their potential! so much potential. must. live. up. to. p o t e n t i a l. you know, the potential of being the next da vinci and winning a nobel prize. ~~no pressure~~ pressure fully intended.

so what happened? did they go full tiger mom on me? did they sign me up for mensa? did they put me on 24/7 home schooling and tutoring to maximize my potential? ...nah. they just sent me to school with the commoners (/s) and expected me to figure it out.

when i was 10, when they found out about my iq, they basically dropped the ball. because, with an iq of 145, why couldn't i just pick up the ball and finish the game myself? because of course iq is the same as discipline, maturity, responsibility, social skills, planning skills, treatment for autism, treatment for depression, and all the various things i *really* needed to succeed in life. when i was 10, they made me skip a grade for the second time, and they dropped me into the deep end of a pool i wasn't ready for (highschool here in the netherlands). it was sink or swim, and when i sank, it was *my fault*. da vinci wouldn't have drowned.

9wo0xa,lincoln should have punished the rebels more.,8.0,8.0,45.0,unpopularopinion,"hannibal of carthage knew how to gain a victory but not how to use it. that phrase always perplexed me until i thought about the civil war and how the confederate government and military were basically given a pardon when they lost.  now look at all the shit we deal with today as a society barely holding together, ready to tear each other apart any second now. if lincoln punished everyone down to every second lieutenant we would probably be living in a better society now. there would be hardly no more racism, black people would not have had to suffer so much injustice from sore losers and their descendants. donald trump definitely would not be president and may not even have been born here if it weren’t for the white supremacy that attracted his father.  equality would be decades ahead for the country.  it’s just depressing to think about how lincoln didn’t use his victory, he could have solved a lot of today’s problems.  and do t give me any shit about “oh the confederates were democrats and lincoln was a republican” i like my history burger with a big side order of context thank you very much.

i’m wondering if it would be better to proactively let people know during my flares to counteract the disbelief after being confronted and because many professor, supervisors and what not just ignore it but might think i am sleeping, which could harm my professional and academic reputation.

the problem is when i have had such conversations,  they can be awkward and people tend to think i’m lying for whatever reason. which is also terrible for academic and professional development. when this happens these conversations can mar my self esteem and be unbelievably frustrating.

i disagree with your statement because its not true to assume such generalizations about people and my grandpa’s cousins step niece wasnt exactly that way even though she was very similar but still its offensive to say that.

my mom has been a nurse for over 40 years, and as she has gotten older she's started to have issues with her back. some research shows that over 80% of nurses will have back problems later in their lives. talking to nurses i have found that they feel the greatest stain on their back occurs trying to lift patients from sitting to standing (free body diagrams have shown this to be true, to strain put on a back at that angle trying to move people who can be up to 600lbs is insane). 

the health care industry is obviously huge, and it's only growing with the population. these people take care of you literally since before you're even born. growing obesity in america only adds to the need for a way to lift patients.

the actual design behind the wheelchair is pretty simple. a hydraulic lift under the chair will push it up and tilt the chair (much like the electronic lift chair recliners you commonly see) and tilt the patient up and onto their feet. it's powered by a pump in front that the nurse will push with her foot. it being in front so she can face the patient and steady them as they get up. a simple handle in back will bring the chair back down. the rest of the design will be simple to keep it easy to clean and durable.

 all in all it works more or less like a hydraulic lift table, but at an angle. it is geared twords overweight patients because those are the ones most likely to cause injury. while there are standing wheelchairs on the market, they all have lower weight capacity, rely on electronics, and are very clearly not designed for hospital use. 

so that's a quick overview, if you have any questions please ask, it's good practice for judging, and any recommendations or help you could offer i would absolutely love.",8924.0,11596.0,0.81,2019-02-20 04:22:58,peterjmonday,0.0,0.0,32.0,1941.0,359.0,210,0,0.11699165,0.019498607,0.0,0.0362117,0.0,0.0,0.0027855153000000002,0.011142061000000002,0.04735376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019498607,0.058495822999999995,0.050139274000000005,0.04735376,0.008356546,0.0,0.0027855153000000002,0.08077995,0.0027855153000000002,0.11420613,0.050139274000000005,0.013927577,0.011142061000000002,0.019498607,0.09749304,0.033426184,0.06128134,0.0,0.016713092,0.019498607,0.07799443,0.0027855153000000002,0.008356546,0.016713092,0.0,0.016713092,0.013927577,0.1281337,0.0,0.5459609999999999,0.03064067,0.0,0.0,0.019498607,0.0027855153000000002,0.008356546,0.008356546,0.0027855153000000002,0.04735376,0.0,0.0,0.013927577,0.019498607,0.005571030500000001,0.008356546,0.0,0.0,0.008356546,0.013927577,0.038997214,0.0362117,0.06963788,0.15041783,0.11699165,0.03064067,0.14206128,0.0,0.016713092,0.0027855153000000002,0.0027855153000000002,0.005571030500000001,0.0,0.013927577,0.08077995,0.09749304,0.0,0.0362117,0.019498607,0.04178273,0.18941504,0.0,0.019498607,0.016713092,0

in my world there are two dwarven kingdoms residing on opposite mountain ranges in an east to west spectrum of the continent. the two kingdoms are incredibly similar in culture excepting the language. the eastern dwarves worship the lighting god dalagog, but the western dwarves are a blank slate.

so my question is this: how could there be two separate kingdoms of very similar cultures on opposite ends of the continent? what caused them to divide? do the western dwarves serve a different deity? was there a cultural rift? give me your ideas!
