9w5fex,straight people are 1/4th gay (oc),12.0,2.0,34.0,copypasta,"to mathematically prove that straight people are 1/4th gay, we need to first discuss what perspective we are going to talk from. since it is a fair assumption that most people that browse reddit are male, and since i am a male, it would make sense to talk and do mathematical calculations from the perspective of a straight male. lets get started.first off, lets talk about what exactly it means to be a straight person. being straight means to be attracted to the opposite gender, and having a desire to reproduce with a mate that you find attractive on the opposite gender. so, what would being non-straight entail? well, not straight would mean that you are eithera. attracted to the same genderb. attracted to more than just the opposite genderc. asexual.option a means that you are not straight, since you are attracted to the same gender you were assigned at birth. option b would be defined as a person being ""bisexual"", a person that is attracted to either gender. lets explore option b from a straight male perspective, as previously explained and justified from the first paragraph.to be a bisexual male means that you are sexually attracted to women and also sexually attracted to men. since homosexual men are 100% gay, bisexual men are 50% gay, as they are attracted to both men and women. 1/1*1/2=1/2. full gay multiplied by half gay = half gay proving that bisexual men are half gay.now we are ready to calculate and mathematically prove that straight men are 1/4th gay.bisexual men are both attracted to males and females. the inherit fact that they are attracted to females makes them straight but since they are also attracted to men they are half gay due to the property of straightness. if you apply this logic to a straight person, they are half bisexual, as they are attracted to only females. if straight men are 50% bisexual, and bisexual men are 50% gay, that makes straight people 25% gay due to multiplying 50% by 50%, mathematically proving straight people are 25% gay.",19510.0,11236.0,0.94,2018-11-11 19:08:16,momdestroyer69420,0.0,0.0,6.0,2015.0,353.0,1,144

9gce2t,"cmv: without a good relationship with your family, it's extremely hard to maintain a romantic relationship",39.0,38.0,106.0,changemyview,"  when people are born into the world, the prototype they have for relationships is their family. the way your parents and siblings interact with you can affect your outlook on relationships in general. somebody might be more likely to get along better with older people if their relationships with their parents is great. if you have a close relationship with your siblings, its easier to have a relationship with those of the same age or whom you hold in the same regard. that is, if you see someone as an older sibling and you have a good history with your older sibling, then youre more likely to allow yourself to get along with that person.    when theres a person without that initial prototype-- or a dysfunctional one-- then it creates a disconnect. the parents that were responsible for framing relationships create one that reverberates throughout their social life. assuming they dont have the resources to see otherwise, the child normalizes what would be seen as dysfunctional to many others. without external factors, the child matures with a warped sense of relationships. they might normalize relationships as combative, competitive, toxic or abusive as a sign for success. kids who have a brother or sister who make them feel inferior always try to fight for their parents love. this competition mindset can help with certain relationships (professional job that might require a competitive edge). romantic relationships-- which require a lot of intimacy-- would otherwise be difficult to maintain with others.  childrens without siblings also seem to exhibit behaviors that might be considered self-centered and introspective. after all, they never had to work with or against their siblings to make sure they had the strongest bond with their parents. its not that all ""only childs"" are inherently incapable of maintaining relationships; just the ones in where having a sibling could have taught them about having a relationship with someone who would be more like a sibling. their bonds would most likely remain superficial and never dive deeper into a creed that lasts.

[spoilers],14.0,19.0,58.0,movies,"i searched for an official discussion thread but couldnt find one. as a huge fan of the original, this sequel surpassed my expectations. considering its been 10 years in development hell, bertino no longer in the directors chair, with johannes roberts taking over (who, until now, hasnt made anything remarkable). i loved the trailer park setting, instead of it just being another home invasion. loved the stylistic throwback to 80s slashers without resorting to nostalgia baiting. there are also a couple sequences that are even better than the  original, particularly the pool sequence with total eclipse of the heart. also the sequence in the bathroom, with the daughter watching her mother get murdered in front of her was genuinely disturbing to me. yes, the characters make really dumb decisions at times (he should have shot dollface. grabbing a gun only to give the killer a 5 second warning before shooting? okay, man. however it gave the call back later when she kills dollface with the shotgun a lot more impact). the cinematography is also downright dazzling, expert use of lighting and framing. loved the slow zooms and fluid editing, the action is never choppy and always perfectly composed. and once again the sound design and soundtrack are tops. id say its about on the same level as the original. its pure nihilistic horror, until the ending embraces the ridiculous tropes of the genre, but in fun and over-the-top ways. my biggest complaint is that their wasnt enough pin-up girl. i was pretty surprised that all the strangers died, and slightly saddened as i wouldnt mind another sequel. but also glad they went into some unpredictable and fresh directions. bailee madison was fantastic in her performance, probably one of my favorite modern ""final girls"". also loved the nod to texas chainsaw massacre in the end. it wont win over any fans, and it goes by horror film logic, but for the most part i loved it. it was better than it had any right to be. i was expecting a bargain bin, soulless cash grab of a sequel. but its obvious that the filmmakers actually put effort into making this and it shows. anyone else see this?

""big macintosh took the knife, and hovered over applebloom, shrunken. he trapped her with a powerful hull, and thrust the knife into apple blooms mouth. swette belle vomited when she saw the scene, thick yellow pieces and smelly acidic liquids splashing and falling heavily on the floor. scootaloo managed not to vomit, but sighed and cried and choked with panic. big macintosh forced to keep apple blooms mouth open and with some effort cut his tongue. apple bloom tried to scream, but his mouth was very full of blood, for all it became a muted murmur. after a short period of time, she collapsed, tears streaming from her eyes, falling unconscious of shock and pain. big macintosh then took the tongue and stood in front of the puddle of rotting vomit on the floor. he smiled at scootaloo.""are you hungry?""scootaloo shook his head vigorously and looked at him defiantly. ""if rainbow dash were here she would kick your ass out of here, you crazy!""big macintosh shrugged. ""well, she would not. anyway, i would not be so sure about that."" rainbow dash is not as tough as it looks. "" he stuck his vomit-laden tongue into scootaloos mouth, and used his hull to catch his mouth. ""not that youre going to spit now,"" he said quietly, with a giggle, the little pony struggled and squirmed. ""has not your mother ever told you that its important to chew the food?""scootaloo closed his eyes and tried desperately to reluctantly, but eventually swallowed apple blooms tongue. big macintosh, still holding scootaloo in his strong hooves, then mounted the orange pony and slid his penis into her vagina, raping her for several minutes, while swette belle looked shaking with disgust and horror. apple bloom was still cold, with blood dripping from her ripped mouth.""cutie mark crusaders, victims of rape ...""big macintosh said mockingly as he raped scootaloo, and then followed with a soft laugh. ""i think you found your purpose, your special talent for being raped.eventually he withdrew from the scootaloo, and grabbed his head firmly and punched several times with his hull, causing his nose to break and gush with blood. he took some of sweetie belles blood and vomit with his tongue and held it in his mouth so that it mingled with his saliva, and then brought his mouth close to scootaloos and spit the mixture into his mouth. he closed his hull over his mouth and held her nose until she choked, had no choice but to swallow.scootaloo vomited, spat, and screamed, he turned to swette belle. he grabbed her easily, for she was too shocked and traumatized to respond, and with apparent amusement he slammed his horn into scootaloos anus. the horn was very large and thick, so the skin around scootaloos anus ripped, soiling swette belles face from a mixture of feces and blood.""youll be doing this, swette belle,"" he said. the unicorn kept pushing its horn into scootaloos anus, slowly but surely. her purple and pink mane was already stained reddish-brown, glowing with urine and blood. ""if you stop, ill be creative. i may seem a bit dense, but im really creative."" big macintosh said. ""eeyup!""he went to apple bloom and penetrated the unconscious body of his younger sister with his erect penis. while he raped her, he picked up another knife, this sharp and shiny one, and cut his open flank, causing his glowing intestines to fall to the ground. he looked over, and was pleased to see that swette belle was still using her horn to penetrate scootaloos anus, and her face was now now completely covered with blood, feces, and urine.he turned his attention to apple bloom and took her scarlet guts and wrapped them around her neck, still raping her, he pulled them until she was wrapped so tightly around apple blooms neck that he broke her windpipe . she was now surely dead, but big macintosh continued to fuck her furiously until her body began to lose shape and collapsing, shaking, and turning a dead mass of skin, blood, and flesh. the pony had fallen, leaving a single red mass, empty and raw. he continued until he was fucking with nothing but a single bloody, bloated hole, and then tossed his younger sisters carcase like a useless apple kernel.he then picked up the knife, picked up swette belle, and tossed it aside. he forced himself on the ruined anus of scootaloo, and then took the knife and cut her ass.",1346.0,1909.0,1.0,2019-01-04 03:26:45,andreyloverofmythos,0.0,0.0,3.0,8903.0,1583.0,1,669

8905mk,top 10 worst reasons you liked the strangers: prey at night,0.0,8.0,59.0,horror,"so, did you see the strangers: prey at night? i saw the strangers: prey at night. it seemed like a lot of people loved this movie, and i sure wanted to love it. i was so excited. and with everyone around you praising it and calling it the best horror movie in years and stupid crap like that, you just feel like a crazy person because you didnt like it that much.  so, everytime someones like i liked it, im just like why??"" i am gonna go over the top 10 reasons everyone seems to like the strangers 2. 1. the fun cast of characters. the movie definitely didnt have that many characters. and 3 of those characters most people only liked by default because they were familiar horror icons. so, pin-up girl, shes apparently a big scary killer who has successfully been killing people for years but we only see her for two scenes. her character doesnt even matter to those who havent seen the first because she dies right after we meet her. dollface wants to kill for no reason at all in the first one, and in this one she dies believing she wants to kill for no reason at all, so no arc there. man in the mask is killed without saying anything, so no arc there.  the whole family is kind of forgettable, the mother (whose name i literally cant even remember) is pretty much wasted as well, although her performance was great when she was alive. the only character who kind of pretends to have an arc is kinsey, were like told that shes a jaded troublemaker, but we dont see her being that thing that were told she is. to everybody saying that the characters were weak on purpose because they were gonna die, and you dont wanna develop characters if theyre gonna die anyway, that is not an excuse. the first film had a little bit of development even though the characters died. 2. the strangers themselves. for some reason, people really enjoyed seeing the strangers transformations from smart, creepy killers who liked to toy with their victims to idiotic, purge-esque killers who just want bloodshed. i dont know why anybody would enjoy that, but for some reason people did. 3. well, okay, the characters were kind of weak. but those action sequences were amazing. so, about three-quarters of the way through, pin-up girl and dollface are dead, the parents are dead, and luke is hidden in a pool closet trying not to die. its just kinsey and man in the mask facing down. so, now kinsey has nothing to lose and she just has to either get away or kill man in the mask. there is no tension watching maskman chase kinsey around because his death is a certainty, and he seems pretty okay with that, right up until and including the moments where he actually dies. our main characters do some exciting things before the climax of the movie, but boy is there few of them. 4. people say the movie is a dark movie because (nearly) all of the characters died. the movie isnt that dark if the characters die, and you arent that sad. nearly all of the character deaths happen so abruptly that there is like no emotion attached to them. the only death i really thought was sad was pin-up girls, and thats just because they put maskman there to witness it. even then, you dont really know the foundation of their friendship, or see them interact that much beforehand. youre just informed that they kill together i guess, and then you see him get mad when she dies. i really dont know why they were in such a hurry to kill all the characters. in the original, characters didnt begin to die until like 45 minutes in, and by the end of this movie, the whole place is englufed in a giant explosion anyway so why didnt they do that? just have the strangers kill kinseys family and then have all 3 of them get blown up in the end. all of the deaths seemed incidental and indirect.5. the first act was slow, but then the action really picks up. i guess i was alone in thinking that the first half of the movie wasnt good, but it was more entertaining than the ending. the first act at least had some emotional conflict, you know with the mother and daughter drama and stuff but then the parents die and these plot threads are effectively over. watching someone escape from somewhere we know theyre going to escape from is not interesting. just because we know kinsey is going to escape doesnt mean this cant be a good movie, but we have to care about the people. 6. “great strangers worldbuilding! this one really confuses me because the universe wasnt expanded at all, we arent informed of anything new about the strangers. the only new thing i remember learning is that the strangers are in a trailrer park now i guess. but what else did we learn? i guess we learned the the strangers can wear different clothes but they keep their masks the same...? we didnt learn anything new about their backstory, or what happened after kristen and james were killed, or anything. 7. i guess i just love this movie because i love the strangers. you wouldnt understand. you know who loves the strangers? i love the strangers. loving something unconditionally doesnt mean you love it more. it just means you can appreciate crap and disappointments as long as they are related to the thing you love. 8. man in the mask was so awesome!"" why was maskman immortal in this movie? he survived a car crash, an explosion, a fire, stabbings, like... what the fuck...9. this movie was visually awesome. i mean, theyre not wrong, it is a really cool looking movie. my favorite thing in the movie were the colors and the outfits, as well as the lighting. but clothes arent a good enough thing to watch a movie for. if somebody was like  this movie wasnt great but i liked the pretty pictures” then i guess i could respect that. i havent heard anybody saying that though.10. this movie was a throwback slasher flick. being a throwback to the 80s doesnt make a movie good, especially when the producers idea of a throwback is neon lights and 80s music. so, thats my list. i dont know, i really wanted to like this movie, and im not trying to ruin it for you if you did like it. to be honest, this movie felt alot like suicide squad. like it felt like it had a good movie, somewhere, and then it just got all chopped up in editing. but hey, how about that first trailer though? that looked like a cool movie. i guess im a fan of the trailer. anyway i hope i explained myself well in this very long editorial.

7ztser,you’re next (2013),0.0,8.0,18.0,horror,"i’d like to begin with saying i know i’m going to receive some backlash. i didn’t like this movie. at least not very much. i’m going to start out with the things i did like.  i loved most of the soundtrack. some of it was extremely pulse pounding and horrifying music, and then some parts of the film just had digital music that sounded like it was ripped from an 80s zombie movie. i’m not saying that type of music is necessarily bad, but i don’t think it fit in this type of film. next, i did think some of the kills were pretty interesting and original. i also did like the killers appearances/costumes. however, the cons outweigh the pros for me. this might just be me, but i would say maybe the first 2 acts or so felt entirely like other home invasion movies, specifically the strangers, with an added garnish here and there. the killers watching from the windows, the jump scares, the messages written on the wall in blood all just reminded me of the strangers. i thought some of the acting was less than satisfactory (but thankfully a lot of those characters were killed off early anyway.) speaking of characters, the only one i had any feelings for was the main girl, and still i didn’t have that much feeling. i thought almost all of the characters besides the  final girl were underdeveloped. my last complaint is that the main character miraculously survived anything that was thrown at her. maybe that’s just a horror movie thing, but how tf did she survive being stabbed, shot with an arrow, thrown out a window, falling a two story drop, etc etc? it was just too convenient for me. as for the twist, i guess it was an okay twist. i didn’t find myself predicting it but i also wasn’t surprised when it was revealed. anyway, if you wanna see the strangers with more creative kills or the purge minus the whole “purge” stuff i found the film for you!

7wovm9,the rage: carrie 2 is probably the most underrated horror sequel ever.,6.0,4.0,70.0,horror,"quick plot synopsis for those who haven’t seen it: sue snell survived the events of carrie (1976) and is now a school counselor at bates high. when a student named rachel comes to her after the suicide of her best friend, sue begins to realize she may hold the same powers carrie possessed all those years ago. sue must try to convince rachel to get help with her powers before another bloodbath commences.the good: this movie is a staple of life in the 90s. the music, rachel’s job at the photomat (when was the last time you heard someone talk about a photomat?) the clothing, it’s all just so aesthetically pleasing. the revival of the sue snell character, as well as the flashbacks to the original, were nice touches. the film has a great soundtrack and some pretty interesting kills! there’s also some references to other films that you horror nerds will probably notice. the bad: of course it’s far from a perfect film. the coincidence that ralph white (carrie’s father) went around impregnating crazy christian women and then leaving them was definitely ridiculous. the effects, especially on the kills, are pretty dated (and not in a good way.) there’s some odd dialogue thrown in there too (the whole football scene with the “tampon string” thing comes to mind.) the film was originally an independent film that was converted into a sequel to carrie. so obviously, when it was first released, the film was a critical and financial failure. in recent years, however, it’s developed somewhat of a cult following. i guess my point is that people shit on this movie far too much! there are way worse stephen king films. conclusion: if you want to see clueless as a horror film, or if a companion piece to carrie interests you, this is the movie for you. overall, probably a 6/10 for me.
