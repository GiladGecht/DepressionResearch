      "['i developed binge eating disorder i have spent the past two years and three months doing absolutely nothing with my time but chronically masturbating, binge eating all day long (i have no limit in how much i can eat. i eat too the point of excruciating pain and feel like i’m going to pass out, and i keep eating well after that. during my bingeing lifestyle i eat nearly every hour of the day most days, and the only time i am not eating is while masturbating (sometimes while even doing that) or sleeping with lots of sleeping pills). it really hurts but i have not been able to stop as food has been the only thing to comfort my severe depression, loneliness, and anxiety, and after all the isolation from having no social life, and using food to cope with that for so long, i’ve truly become addicted to eating this way, and i have excruciating shame for myself and every day of the past. i am traumatized and it seems like all of this that i have been through haunts me every day now. i started a new school sophomore year when my bingeing problem first started. in the sixth grade i developed anorexia after a very hard move, and was forced into years recovery until freshman year by my parents...it wasn’t a bad thing though, the treatment i had gone through really did help me overcome anorexia and ocd back then. though, it didn’t resolve my social anxiety that left me as a social outcast in school, which eventually made me decide to give homeschooling a try as i was so lonely everyday at school and just had a rep for being the quiet fashionable kid (not joking i was actually picked best dressed at my eighth grade dance which was pretty cool). i tried to make friends, i really did, but i was just such a shy, social anxious kid. i was used to not have any friends at that point though so it began to not really bother me and it just felt like the norm. so, i started high school online. this ended up being a big mistake. it was fine at first because like i said i was used to not having many friends so though i had high social anxiety i was used to spending much time alone. but eventually it just caught up to me. i gained heaps of weight as i was eating more and my acne also got really bad (bad enough to go on accutane) and my self esteem hit rock bottom. i felt like a disgusting creature worthy of no guy’s love, and i worried that i would grow old alone and never get married (sorry if this sounds so dramatic but it felt this bad. since i had no friends ever throughout all these years, i just “knew” that there had to be something wrong with me and a reason why i couldn’t attract anyone). so i eventually started spending lots of time in bed, sleeping, not eating, and not doing any of my online schoolwork. i lost a lot of weight again due to not eating caused of this depression and low self esteem, which later resulted in me being hospitalized over the summer for heart problems and other symptoms from my low weight. during this depression, i attempted suicide twice just a month apart from each other. the second time was so severe as i don’t remember anything after i passed out and was only told what happened once i eventually awoke in the hospital days later.okay, so sophomore year started and i was going to be starting at a new school in a different town. i knew homeschooling was lonely and i knew i couldn’t go back to it. i honestly met some nice people in the short time i was there and the school was great. i still had a lot of social anxiety, but i’m sure if i had joined some clubs and gotten out of my comfort zone to interact with peers, things could have been great. there was even a great counselor at the school that really wanted to help me. but a new problem came that continues to haunt me to this day. binge eating.i began uncontrollably stuffing myself with food because i was so hungry. i didn’t originally do it because of depression']\n",

      "['i have a masters degree now, and ive left university, so ive run out of excuses to  not apply for jobs. i rarely ever apply for jobs because i feel like im worthless and ill never be good at anything. i have absolutely no value to anyone, and ive been living off my parents and off student loans for the past few years. i have a bad case of social anxiety and i often dont leave the house at all for weeks at a time, unless i absolutely need to. in the past few years, id mostly only ever leave the house to attend classes and exams at my university because i often dont even want to be *seen* by anyone, not even neighbours. now that uni is off the table, ive been almost entirely housebound since december 2014. i can hardly talk to/deal with people, and the thought of facing a job interview has always terrified me, more so the longer ive gone on without having ever been interviewed, and without any real work experience besides university projects.a week ago, i submitted my first batch of job interviews since completing my masters degree and for the first time ever, i actually got a call. i guess the masters qualification really is worth something. i was in a state of panic when i suddenly found myself in the middle of a phone interview, and after answering all the questions i was asked to the best of my ability, i was invited to come to an actual interview, which was today.i went and had the interview. im sorry to say it didnt go so great. i was quite nervous, and they didnt ask any of the \"common interview questions\" people are always advised to prepare for, so a lot of questions caught me off guard and i started struggling with feelings of anxiety the longer the interview went on. even though the interviewers were friendly and personable, i felt like running from the room and hiding myself away somewhere. im pretty sure i came across as a socially awkward, dysfunctional idiot, and ive been lying in bed since coming home from the interview hours ago, not moving, not doing anything. i almost feel traumatised, as pathetic as that sounds. i cant bring myself to get up and try to function because i feel like my worthlessness has been confirmed by the job interview. ill always be a loser. ill never be good enough to work anywhere for anyone. ill never amount to anything. i felt like crying earlier, now i just feel numb. so yeah, thats been my experience with my first ever job interview. i know im worthless, so you dont have to rub it in. i just wanted to let someone know how im feeling.i take solace in knowing im probably going to commit suicide when i turn 30. ive come up with this plan as a pact with myself to just endure and try my best for just a little while longer, but my 30th birthday in may 2020 is my expiry date. the world will be better off without me. i wish i werent so fucking pathetic. i wish i wasnt broken.**tl;dr** (in case you missed it at the top and scrolled to the end) had my first ever job interview today at the age of 24. it didnt go so great and ive been feeling extra depressed']\n",

      "['i lack all the objective/interpersonal means to do it.*background: since 2013, i suffer from all symptoms of severe depression (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3181882/) mixed with some kind of anxiety disorder with recurrent obsessive-compulsive behaviors (order, hygiene, social phobia…). this has lead me to social isolation and insomnia. no income, totally parent-dependent, dropped out of college, never had a job and only a friend remains loyal. hypothesis: psilocybin (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/psilocybin) has been proved in several clinical studies as the most powerful antidepressant/anxiolytic ever known. a single dose is enough to change psychological markers up to 6 months after intake and toxicity and dependence are near to 0 (tolerance is very high). my guess is that this substance could change my neurochemistry or even inflammation levels (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5542678/) in order to allow an adaptive brain function, ending my depressive-anxious disorder. considering current evidence, our thoughts are made of neurotransmitters, not the other way around: this empirical approach on psychobiology rather than cognitive psychology is the chosen path to follow here. i will not enter in brain receptors details neither how tryptamines look like serotonin etc. since i lack the knowledge.testing: in this first phase, i’ve only taken 2 moderate doses. first of them was 2.5 dried grams of psilocybin cubensis. some visuals, very improved mood, a lot of energy to accomplish simple tasks that i could enjoy and some “philosophical insights”. the major most recent one happened after a couple days after the second dose (1.9g, two weeks after): “attachment is the root of my suffering, the more i convince myself that i need something, the more fear/anxiety/depression i will feel and that’s what is keeping myself away from connecting and loving other people, things, ideas.... because true passion and love cannot happen if there’s the fear of loss or the craving/urgence of accomplishment.”. conclusions: at first sight from a materialistic/western/empirical approach, this reasoning makes no sense. how could you be happy and progress in life if you “don’t give a fuck” about failure/loss/defeat/death? sounds a paradox but it seems my brains works better when it’s released from the burden of attachment (a past/future cognitive dynamic?). i’ll give you an example: i went to buy some food at the supermarket but suddenly i did something different i almost never do (openness improved) that is to “perceive” the hq shopping cars that are better than the ones i only used because you don’t have to “bow” each time you purchase an item. this may sound very simple and stupid from a well functioning mind, but for a depressive']\n",

      "['i am 27 years old and i have no idea how ive ended up here. as a child i has painfully shy and insecure. looking toward the future always felt like a fever dream - out of reach, surreal and too distant to see. i graduated high school in 2009 and almost immediately was swept up by a new group of friends who i met via the soccer team. these friends introduced me to people who came from very different homes than i did. they went to parties, drank alcohol, smoked weed, had sex and used social media. having grown up in a christian home and attending exclusively religious schools, i had not been exposed to any of these things. i was the sheltered kid who everyone used as a form of entertainment. they loved to joke about how prudish i was and enjoyed corrupting me. i lost my virginity that summer. i was asked to do things that i did not want to do. unfortunately, i was high on the feeling of being accepted. for the first time in my entire life, i felt that i fit in somewhere with a group of friends who willingly included me. combined with my complete lack of self-respect, i rapidly made careless decisions and the list of regrets grew. i allowed myself to be used, degraded, humiliated and then dumped. two years later, i broke up with my first boyfriend after a friend of his raped me and he refused to believe me. by comparison, the next man i met was bound to look like a saint. i wish i knew that before i gave him everything.he was a tattoo artist, and i was ever willing to compromise anything and everything about myself to earn love. he was constantly talking to other women and doing inappropriate things. instead of leaving, i just worked harder to keep his attention. we dated for 4 years and eventually got married. right before the wedding, he put his hands on me. he threw me onto the bathroom floor and sat on me until i couldnt breathe. he gave me a concussion and then begged me to forgive him. as i lay in bed with my head throbbing and my elbow split open, he frantically cried next me. i married him 2 months later. when he was upset, he would go to his office and pull his ar-15 from its case and threaten to kill himself. i couldnt leave. i had decided that if i was going to be trapped with him forever, then i would just kill myself. but opportunity knocked when he went to minnesota for thanksgiving with his family. i packed my things and left.it is almost 2019. i have spent most of my adult life just trying to pick up the pieces of my existence. i have always felt like i am watching my life from the sidelines. the older i get, the more things get clearer. i am learning that i never wanted anything that i couldnt give myself. i should have never let anyone tell me what to do, or use me. i am heartbroken because its too late.i am 27 years old. i am a bartender with no other qualifications. i worked as a nurse aid in the past, and i could renew my license...but i am covered in very visible tattoos and im not sure many hospitals/long term care facilities would hire me. i see a therapist once a week to discuss my anxiety and depression']\n",

(for reference, i am now 22 years old.). this means there is always an uncomfortable aura in the house which means i can never fully unwind. i share a room with my brother and mother. the room was never meant to house more than one person and an extension, aka \"work room\" was built on to the bedroom which is what my brother and i share. i also have a grandfather who lives in vegas and hes been wanting me to live up there with him but i need to make money first, and i cant hold a job.**hobbies**: growing up, video games, listening to music, and reading books were my favorite things to do. overtime, ive lost interest in books though and i waste a lot of time on reddit these days. i also golfed from a very young age to about 17. i never liked it, i just did it because i thought my mom wanted me to do it. ive also had many random passing thoughts go by but never act on them. for example: archery, playing guitar/drums, making youtube videos, writing things, running and hiking are a few. ***jobs:*****counter/cook** - first job. held for 2 years. age 18-20. i was generally a good worker and dependable but occasionally i would show up a few minutes late. i had a good thing going at this particular restaurant and management liked me, but i quit. this was around the time i failed college. i even was rehired for a few weeks by the same manager before i impulsively quit again.**busser**-didnt get past the online orientation because i thought it was needlessly complicated, so i walked out.**cashier** (gas station)- made it past orientation but didnt show up for shifts.**cashier** (grocery store)-i made it one day, then stopped showing up.**movie theater**-got hired and didnt show up because my body wouldnt move out of the car. **movie theater (different location, current. age 22.) - finished my first shift yesterday and my brain really wants me to fall back to familiar habits and go no show again.***medical*****therapist** - started seeing one around age 19. i thought she wasnt helping me by just talking general stuff. so i cut off contact.**psychiatrist** - started seeing one age 21. depression']\n",

      "['i zoomed through k-12 slacking but made it to pretty good college. i even got a decent scholarship plus an out of school scholarship. however that’s when everything fell apart. i finished my first semester with a 1.0 gpa. i got a d in english and failed calc iii. ironically enough, i never got less than a b on the essays i turned in. i didn’t have trouble with content per se and did well on most tests but i couldn’t find the motivation to go to class, do assignments, or study. i even accidentally missed a calc test. i am lazy piece of shit and i’ve always knew that but this is the first time i was actually punished for it. my in school scholarship is accessed at the end of spring so i still had time to improve. i was put on academic probation but i didn’t tell my parents. they had my two younger siblings to worry about so they didn’t really stress me out to much. they trusted me to be an adult so they didn’t feel the need to inspect my grades even though they were helping me out with money. being as i was always the star child, i was ashamed and told them that i was doing mediocre as opposed to abysmal. towards the end of my last semester, my friend helped me realize that was depressed. when the spring semester started, i started doing counseling. i of course didn’t tell my parents. i don’t know if it was shame or me not wanting them to worry. over the course of counseling, i found out that i have adhd but i wasn’t officially diagnosed til april. the second semester, like the first one, started off strong. i went to every class and did every assignment and even tried to start early. i had to retake english because i need a c to take the next level. the only available section was an 8 am. that’s where the wheel fell off. i had trouble picking a topic for a paper so i stopped going to class for a little bit. the anxiety from that spilled into my other classes. concurrently, i stopped do my calc iii hw since i was doing well in tests and quizzes. i eventually made it back to my english class but my professor gave me stiff stipulation for a c (which was fair considering she could have just failed me, which she ended up doing, but at least she gave me a chance first). she helped me finish the essay i was stressed about but by then i was very behind. i was very depressed. i found myself smoking weed on weekdays and sleeping all day. the only spotlight was my poli sci class where i got an a. all in all, i brought my gpa to 1.95 but it wasn’t enough. i was suspended and lost my scholarships but didn’t tell my parents. over the summer, i appealed my suspension and scholarship and got both back. this semester was supposed to be my moment of redemption. however, i failed and it was no fault but my own. and it was the same story. start of strong but crap out in the end. throughout the semester i’ve told my parents that i’m doing better but that’s not true. i kept it from them because i thought i could fix it but now, everything is going to come out when howard doesn’t allow me back. tbh, part of it kind of freeing because now i don’t have to live a lie but it’s hard to tell my parents who are immigrants that i wasted their time and money because of foolishness. i wish i partied my grades away but i spent most of my time moping and depressed']\n",

( about 1 hour and 20 minutes away) before we met she had a rough childhood and was already dealing with some kind of light depression and was going to therapy after her father passed. then we met and its been nothing but amazing memories and amazing time spent together. we both are young but we are sure that we will one day get married and be together for life. we constantly think and plan for the future. lately all of a sudden stress, her anxiety, and depression all hit at once and now shes dealing with a bigger form of depression. shes constantly sad, unmovitaed, really just a shell of herself. its gotten to the point that she claims that outside of our relationship she has no true happiness anymore, no passions, hobbies. shes living a very robotic life right now, has 2 jobs/ goes to school full time. i agreed that she needed space to just \"find herself\" and go to therapy. she just came back from the therapist and they suggested that me and her go on a full break up, her depression is too severe and that it could take months for it to get better. they told her that shes too dependent on me and needs to break up with me. obviously i was shocked and hurt that she agrees with them in a sense and agreed on a short break. shes in a state if confusion because she feels bad that im giving her space and waiting for her. i told her that im giving her space and that i will still be supportive. im kind of just ranting right now and trying to get everything off my chest, i guess im asking for advice on how i can support her while at a distance. what are things i can do as her boyfriend to guide and help her through this. i know that depression']\n",

      "['i havent had a girlfriend ever. i tried. i really fucked tried, but having had a rough middle school experience which totally ruined my self-esteem for many years, i could never take up the courage to be around girls or atleast my fully comfortable around them. this whole situation lasted until around the time i went to high school, where i became much more confident, got into shape and cared for how i looked around girls but i was so caught up in the whole high school experience and with grades in general that i found having a relationship to be not worthwhile...fast forward to when im just turn 21, and i still havent had a girl. i cant believe my fucking luck. i blamed myself alot for this. after high school (which was an amazing experience), instead of going out, experiencing things, i focused solely on college and video games. hardly went out and the only social interaction i had was at work at a subway. then one day, i finally had enough and got back into shape like how i did when i first came to high school and basically became that confident guy i was in high school again...my motivation for doing all this? i found a girl at my work that was worthwhile, someone i could literally see myself with. have you heard the saying, if your patient the right girl will come to you...well, she was the one for me, the girl ive waited and looked for so long. she literally had every quality i wanted from a girl, sincerely nice, outgoing and fun. i changed so much for her. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people and i went back to finish college and even got my first real career job as a software developer just to prove to her im not a loser. in someways, it helped made me become the cool, confident person i always wanted to be and envisioned myself to be when i became 21. basically, i felt like i was at my prime and i thought that everything was going into place, this was the fantasy moment i always envisioned.she took notice of my change from that quiet shy guy to the new person i am now, and me and her got close for the past few months. we never kissed or held hands but i definitely felt some small spark and unlike other guys shes been with, she didnt mind the occasional kiss on the cheeks here and there. she is touched with the things i do for her and we would spend hours together after work. i would help her with work off the clock, comfort her when she was down and do just anything to make her happy.... she would drag me everywhere and she says my name in a certain way that just makes my heart melt. she was the first girl i ever felt being fully comfortable being just myself around. i thought this was a sign.... i just needed that one break, that one chance to prove to her that i am an awesome person that wont hurt her like her ex did to her.....i never got a real chance, i was shot down even before i could ask her out on a date...a real date with just me and her and not a group thing with her friends....she told me she did have some feelings for me, but she said shes afraid it would never workout. she said she doesnt want to lose me if it never works out....she was sincere about that but i knew the other big real reason. she is still hung up on her ex. she always told me she was over him but when a girl says shes 99% over with her ex, you know she is totally not. the ex works right next door and would always come over to her and try to patch things up with her. she never gave me a real chance because she still loves him....and im left in the dust, heartbroken, a \"friend\" in her eyes and at best a plan \"b\".....i dont talk to her as much anymore as i just wanted my feelings to die at this point....talking to her would just bring those feelings back...and i dont want to go back....the pain was already too much the first time...i became so fucking depressed. this wasnt the first time this happened to me, ive had girls do this to me before, but i didnt take it too seriously cause i wasnt really very close to those girls. but i felt so sure about this one....it was the closest ive ever been to a girl and the closest ive ever been to getting a girlfriend and for the first time ever, i truly felt the \"spark\" i always hear about from relationships. it hurts even more that despite my brain saying to just move on, my fucking heart keeps on trying to find any excuse to try again. i feel awkward now because sometimes the new coworkers comment on how i am. some are flattering, like they say how im pretty cute but others say i look like a fuckboy or a chad. its just a reminder of how much i changed. they judge my appearance and demeanor and thought i be the type to have a girlfriend but really i am a socially awkward loveless loser...and them saying that only makes me feel so fucking fake...of how much i changed for someone that never truly had the same feelings back...one things for sure, i dont think i can open up to another girl anymore....atleast for a while....now its just wallowing in my sorrow of being so alone in this fucking world....i just want one fucking chance....why is it so fucking hard to give a guy a chance....&#x200b;tl:dr;  i never had a girlfriend. every rejection pushed me to better myself in someway. recently met the girl of my dream. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people. she was interested in me and i was in love with her, but she wouldnt let go of her ex. then she rejected me and said she liked me as a \"friend\".....biggest heartbreak ever. now, im depressed']\n",

      "['i am so fucking lonely and feel like such a fucking loser. i am 21 fucking years old, turning 22 in a few months and ive yet to fucking find even a grain of love from someone i held feelings for. like what the fuck is wrong with me? i feel so fucking lonely for the longest time, and at the time when i really needed someone elses affection to help me get through the toughest time in my life, ive only succeeded in having another girl just reject my feelings towards her. this makes me feel like trash because this wasnt the first time it happened. ever since middle school, every girl that rejected me had always something about me that they didnt like and me being so insecure about myself thought that perhaps if i change myself into a better person, maybe i could get someone to finally accept my feelings back.i changed so much for these girls. i changed how i looked, how i dressed, how i acted, became more fit, confident, humorous, good-looking, heck i fucking even got better grades in my school and continued my education in college just to show off i am not a loser....as if i am like competing for being an eligible bachelor in those cheesy sitcoms. nobody wouldve recognized the disgusting, nervous wreck of a person i was before into the confident guy i am now.&#x200b;heres a picture of me on the left with the stripe shirt:[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/d/d0/1252512511.png/revision/latest?cb=20181001021806](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/d/d0/1252512511.png/revision/latest?cb=20181001021806)&#x200b;yet even when i changed so much, even when i felt like i was at my prime and at the tender age of 21, i still fucking failed! this latest girl was soooo different from all the other girls ive met. i truly felt like she was going to be the one, the girl that would be my very first love. but i was an idiot. i guess the last flaw i never was able to get fixed was figuring out if a girl liked me or not. i waited too long and didnt show my affection and now her feelings towards me had vanished. i realized my mistake the moment she said these words...\"just be yourself ramon, you dont have to be anyone else to impress me\"......no girl has ever said such a thing to me, and when i heard it from her, thats when i instantly fell in love wit her. i realized my mistake and tired desperately to rekindle that feeling but i couldnt get her to have the same spark she had before. she said in her own say that she has still embers of feeling towards me, but that she didnt believe it would last long if me and her got together. from what conversations we had for each other, it seemed to me shed rather keep me as a friend then to lose me as a person.....she was a truly amazing person, and despite myself, i was more than willing now more than ever to be anything she wanted me to be if she just gave me one last chance. but apparently this girl doesnt have feelings for people based on how they are as a person but more if she holds a certain spark for them. my spark for her is immense and white-hot but her for me is small embers.i hope you guys understand my feelings right now as i typed this with tears rolling down my cheeks as i had to vent my feelings out somewhere. ive heard soon she will be leaving the workplace me and her both work at (which is the only place me and her really get to be together) and i feel like i will never find another girl like her in the world. she always says that even if we wont see each other for a while, she still thinks we are close friends but despite myself i cant see myself without her. she isnt allowed to go out and have social interactions because of her strict parents, so i keep on being afraid she would find someone else in her new job and she would forever be taken from me. shes going to be another reminder of my failure in finding love and i am once again alone. the reason why i desperately seek love is because ive never felt any true love in my own family and i cant get the same feeling from my friends. she was a truly loving person and her family was very loving as well, the kind of family i always wanted growing up and i was more than willing to be a part of. i was willing to have given her the world...now here i am....back at my community college working to transfer to san diego state university, working a second job as programming intern job in a medical/health tech startup. sometimes i contemplate if i should go work at the new place where she is planning to work next just so i can get some quality time with her again. some people would say that i am successful and happy and getting somewhere in life. what they dont know is that deep inside, i am insecure, alone and depressed']\n",

      "['i play a lot of video games. ever so often, a game will get frustrating (usually in a online multiplayer game)...then more frustrating, stacked on top more frustration, then i go into a stupid rage where i am bashing myself in the head. like, hard. why. anger just gets to a point where i cant control myself i guess. sadly, this has been going on for a long time (15 years maybe), only, i used to bash things like my computer desk, or punch a hole in the wall (oof...embarrassing). i think i started bashing myself in the head because it doesnt make a huge loud noise like bashing my desk/wall used to...so i can rage in quiet while no one else in the house is the wiser. they might pick up on it once in a while and be like \"did you hear some noises?\" and im all, \"nope!\". then the rest of the night im super depressed, like, \"i cant believe i did that, again...got so worked up over something that doesnt matter at all, again.ugh. i already have enough problems in my life without these anger spurts that happen once a month or so. and my brain has probably taken some lasting damage- well, maybe not, i dont know. repeated forceful impacts to the head are not a good thing, thats for sure.and im not in a bad mood going into the game, i just want to have some fun. like yesterday, had a great day, got plenty of exercise and had fun. day is happy and fine. then i have some free leisure time so i fire up a video game...and circumstances are so that its just one failure after another, and it mounts into a rage quickly. i dont take it out an anyone else, or project my anger on anyone but just myself...which is something positive, i guess. it just happens so fast, one minute ill be fine and the next im smashing my head. also seems like im hardly breathing at all (been trying to focus on my breathing, too often my heart is racing while playing the game).easy answer is to stop playing the game! not a bad option, but i have given up games in the past, and always end up on something else. i think the problem is way more me than any video game, and its me that im trying to fix. i have plenty of gaming sessions where i can play the game and be fine, even if losing and i play and be happy and enjoy the game, but every once in a while, i get that horrible quick-onset rage.sometimes other players are hideously mean, too, of course, but when that happens it usually that just makes me really depressed']\n",

      "['i was 11 i fell into depression. i dont even remember much but suddenly i was gone. when i woke up again my life consisted out of small fragments and everything i ever had had fallen apart. when i was 14 i collapsed in the middle of the school. then i was brought to therapy.i was never a \"truly happy\" child, i did play with friends and run around yes but i especially liked spending my time on my living room desk drawing and doing crafts. i also liked building things with lego - not the sets where you have to follow instructions. i had a large box of lego duplos (the bigger ones) and i just build worlds, cities, landscapes, castles, schools etc. but there was always this dark, grey shadow lingering in the back of my head which i could never grasp. i think i was born with depression but with 11y the first symptoms showed.when i was 11 i had to change school. it is mandatory in my country - basically we sort children into \"bad\", \" medium\" and \"good\" and when they finished school the graduations worth depends on how they were sorted. utterly ridiculous but thats a different story.  the class i had where i had 3 friends got split up in 3 different schools and i ended up alone. but at first it was ... okayish? i had to go to the city by bus to get there and i met new people. at the first day i became friends with a girl. she was the opposite of me, she was optimistic, kind of naive and she liked cute and sparkly things. in my country there are no school uniforms but she kept wearing school clothing from american movies she saw because she thought it was cute, so she wore lots of plaid skirts and blouses. i dont hate what she liked, especially her outfit which i found quite cute as well, thats why we were able to be friends, but my behaviour and looks were totally different.many things changed when i was 11. i hit puberty, without me knowing what it was and how to call it my interest in girls (im lesbian) increased drastically. another girl in that class fit my preferences by 100%. she also had a cute pointy nose which i loved (she however kind of hated it). i didnt know, but i liked her. some of the people i met went into the city after school and although my parents never would have allowed it i still followed them from time to time and we spend some time in shops and went eating ice cream or pizza.but suddenly the black shadow in the back of my mind snapped and like a deep fog it drowned my entire life in nothingness. suddenly it was all gone - my best friend with her pink glitter pens, my first crush with her cute nose, the small trips to stores in the city, everything was gone. i remember one week where i felt tired like i never was before. i felt like my head was filled with nails, my face was burning and the desk was shaking under me while i tried to write. i felt as if i would collapse and my sense of balance was switched off. after one week of tiredness i came home on friday, collapsed behind my rooms door and i cried. i didnt even know why back then. it was the last time i cried for weeks because i went completely numb.i kept going to school, i kept falling almost asleep in school. i started daydreaming, not in a regular way, in an obsessive way. my childish brain couldnt deal with it so i fled into a fantasy world. eventually i remember \"waking up\" for one or two weeks. i realized it was summer already and the school year was over. i realized that not only had i hurt my friend since i stopped talking to her, i also had made my crush extremely angry because i felt like i had to get rid of her since she was disturbing me. i didnt know i was gay, luckily, otherwise it would have hurt way way more. i never went to the city with others again. there was no ice cream after school anymore and no funny pictures with flip phones (im old lol) in ridiculous clothing we found in a store. additionally i also basically ghosted my best childhood friend who didnt know what was wrong with me.what should i have done? i had no idea i even had an issue. i had no idea what depression even was. this circle continued. i was gone for weeks and suddenly realized my life had changed. when i was 14 i woke up again after a massive depressed episode, one of the worst i had so far, and i realized that i was bullied. it happened quite often that i sat in class and someone threw pieces of paper at me. i just picked them up and dropped them to the floor. i didnt hate my bullies. i was just annoyed. i casually mentioned to my mother - and she terrorized my teachers to help me and all of them were in huge trouble. one even apologized - although that was only because his mother forced him to. i didnt want any of this. i even felt sorry they were in trouble.another time i started realizing i had gotten my period a few months ago and that i despised pad so i switched to tampons. that was also when i started to look into the mirror again. i dont know what i always saw for months, but it wasnt me. but one day i saw me - uncombed, oily hair that had turned from golden hazelnut to a greyish mud. my skin was more bluish then red and i had scratched my akne until i developed scars (they luckily disappeared). i was not showered and since i barely smell i didnt know how much i smelled of sweat. it probably was a lot. i was shocked. what i saw was not a 14yo girl, i saw someone who looked like a zombie. that was also the nickname my bullies gave me - and i understood them. the shock was so big i now do shave my armpits and legs almost every single day, drown myself in deodorant and i cut off my hair to a short pixie. the next thing i saw was my breasts that had grown and now were clearly visible. i remember that my mom gave me bras which i didnt wear. i then wore one every single day.the next shock came a few days later. i slowly regained attention to my body after regular showers for a few weeks. i felt sick the entire day. i had lost a lot of weight. on 1.5m i weight 42kg - according to bmi that is too skinny, and i was really skinny. it was surely unhealthy. i had headaches each evening. my mom wouldnt let me stay at home from school because i \"looked much better now\". it was winter and i had to walk from my bus to school for 15 minutes. it was snowing but i only wore a shirt and a thin jacket. my jeans had holes in them and the only shoes i had were 3years old and had holes from daily use.  and i was freezing. i will never forget the cold i suddenly felt for my entire life. i never realized it before but it was there now. and with each step moving felt harder and harder, as if my joints would freeze together. i felt the cold on my bones as if it would drill nails through them. sometimes it wasnt cold anymore, the coldest parts, especially my thighs and fingers, felt like they were set on fire from within and my toes and breasts went numb. i always liked warm weather but this one experience did it for me. whenever i feel cold now i remember this one moment and i could start crying sometimes, other times i start being furious and yell at everyone.when i reached school my hair was frozen from the snow, my skin was pale white with blue rings under my eyes and my lips were dark purple. i was late because i couldnt walk fast. after years of not answering although i was called for at least 5 times already, after looking like i lived in a cave for months and wearing broken shoes and shirts and not being able to remember what day it is so i  walked into the wrong class on a daily basis and after coming to class this morning in basically summer clothing looking like a moor corpse that was stored in the freezer my teacher looked at me - and threatened with detention (or the version we have in my country) if i came late one more time, telling me how kind she is that i only receive an f. i didnt really care back then, i was just glad the windows were closed and the snow was outside.i sat down and my body warmed up a little. but it was too much for my body. i didnt have the strength anymore. in the second lesson that day i got my period and i felt the cramps for the first time. my mom always told me to take ibuprofen when it hurt so thats what i did. which was bad. now i didnt feel the any pain anymore as well. i didnt feel how my knees were getting weaker, i didnt feel how i became sick. in the third lesson we had chemistry and we worked in groups. i was grouped with a girl that at least did talk to me from time to time. and she suddenly realized that i my lips were turning purple again. i am still thankful for her reaction, she did everything correctly. she calmly told the teacher we had to go to the \"room for those who are ill\" (i dont know any word in english for that) so i can lay down on a bench they had somewhere (it was basically a storage room where they squeezed in a bench). she hold my arm when we walked down the stairs and i made it down but when we arrived it was too much. my knees gave in and i was falling. not fast, just slow enough to first sit on my knees and then fall aside. my whole body was shivering. the secretary came and announced through the speakers that someone from the \"nursery team\", aka pupils who made several first aid tests should come down. my blood pressure was extremely low. they gave me coke and chocolate because of the caffeine and sugar to give my body an energy boost. i can remember how my vision was blurry and how i suddenly felt tears in my eyes although i felt... fine? i didnt feel like crying. the shivering was annoying but i could lay down, close my eyes and i didnt have to sit anymore. i had a blanked which warmed me and i felt like suddenly at least someone cared. i tried to assure them i wasnt freaking out and super anxious. they kept me talking for 15 minutes to see how responsive i was but i stayed conscious. my father fetched me half an hour later and they decided i was brought into therapy. thats when i first was diagnosed with a mental illness, back then it was only \" being stressed out\". the diagnosis for depression']\n",

      "['i am 21f and i study currently. i have depression for over 10y now and i had a few therapists. i took st johns wort for some weeks a few months ago and while it overall made me feel a bit better my life was still shit and my depression got no way better. last weeks it got... worse. before i was alternating between two phases: one where i was rather fine and could do my things if someone forced me to (mostly a good friend from uni) and one where i was in bed only wishing i would finally die. but now the last phase is not only constant, it also changes. i have an highly important (personally important, not medically necessary) appointment with a doctor and i hope to get surgery -complicated, takes too long to explain but its nothing that affects my health. i send the shit he gave me to my insurance and they didnt answer yet but thats normal since that takes weeks, sometimes months. anyways, thats the only thing that had been new the last months.so i get more aggressive. whenever theres a slight inconvenience i get angry and either shut down completely and lock myself in or i get violent. i feel like the fight i have now for over 10y dreaded me from all the energy that i once had. i threw a chair through the room and one leg broke, i regularly kick my trashcan, i took my old (inexpensive, i never spend more than 150-200€) phone and threw it against the wall so it broke in tiny pieces, i flipped a small drawer over and everything that was in it flew through my room etc... i also started self harming. i have no knife in my room and since i still live with my parents i only use scissors. when i do i usually go almost blind, i barely feel the pain and i start blindly using anything i have against myself. a few weeks ago i took the scissors and started hitting and scratching my upper arm. i got a few cuts who didnt bleed too much (it wasnt really sharp) but the bruises stayed for weeks. one week ago i took the scissor again, sat down and bulled my knee to my upper body and run the blade through my leg and hip (to get more pressure), now i have a few (deeper) cuts on my hip.another thing is getting up in the morning. let me say it that way: i cant. i barely wake up, my friend from uni stays at my place a lot bc i was late so often to wake me up. it usually takes over half an hour. yes, im a night owl but today i could sleep longer and still didnt wake up. whenever i wake up in the morning i feel like my body is collapsing as if my circulation and blood pressure would drop instantly. i always had that, but now its even worse. i fear it, honestly. i fear the moment when i have to get up in the evening when i go to bed. today was just like that. my friend was there and after 5 attempts to wake me up he opened the blinds. i could still only barely sit up and i spend another 15 minutes on my phone until i stood up. then i drove to uni and it was raining which is something i hate the most (the weather has a 100% direct influence on my health), then it took me 30min to find a parking place and now im done. i already missed half the course, im in the cafeteria now drinking coffee (which i also hate but they dont have green tee).im just... im done. i either want to sleep until forever and never get up again or i want to be drugged so everything feels beautiful. my friend always sais i forgot how to be positive and like the things around me, but thats not true. i never thought this world is beautiful. even as a child i hated this place, but i could just spend my time at home drawing. i never was delusional about my future and i always knew this world is cruel and society sucks. im just tired man, i just want things to end... i missed half this semester already (and i dont think i can catch up until exams anyways) and i just want it to end, which way ever. he also always mentiones other people. his father works a whole fucking lot, has a job and also owns a company and does a lot of other stuff including hobbies. he said \"yesterday he was up until past 1am to do stuff but he also got up at 7am to do other stuff and he can be happy, not everyone suffers like you do\". i just snapped at him that his father doesnt have a circulatory failure each morning either.tl;dr: depression']\n",

      "['i recently graduated high school and was dating someone for three years at that point. i believed myself to be happy, i was getting good grades, and on the surface i seemed like i was successful. i didn’t get into the university of my choice, but i was offered an opportunity to reapply if my gpa was high enough. at my graduation there was this girl i had started talking to from one of my classes. she was a 10/10, but a lot of people i knew didn’t like her because of what one of her ex’s says about her (that she’s crazy and a whore). i offered her some help early that year dealing with some of his crap and we became friends over it. everyone was hugging so i felt no shame in hugging her too. about a month later i broke up with my girlfriend. it took me 3 years to realize the whole time i was being emotionally abused and drained to the point my family noticed a complete change in my happiness. i went to drink the pain away, and instead of drinking alone like an idiot, i wanted to drink with someone that understood the pain i was going through. i texted her and she said yes, but she would have to sneak out. enter one of the best nights of my life and the start to the most memorable summer ever. we started dating two or three weeks later, after i was one of the few people to ask what happened to her when her phone went dark (she had gotten in serious trouble from her parents, no cell), and immediately fell in love with her family and her. she broke me out of a shell i had no idea i was in. we were sporadic, doing things on a whim. i had always wanted to live my life on a “why not” basis, and that was the only way we did anything. we would only plan for bigger things, occasionally throwing them out for better ones. in the summer she allowed me to experience what it meant to have fun, and to enjoy life. fall hit her hard though. she has so many problems from her dad leaving her family, one of which is seasonal depression. when i went off to college, we tried to make it work. she started to exist on seeing me on that once a week schedule, me being the only one to make her feel happier and fulfilled. meanwhile i had so much trouble adjusting and taking the pressure. i cut for the first time just before i left, and cut again later in the semester. i was disgusted with myself, but for some reason i still did it again. one night i nearly put a knife through my forearm, and another with my girlfriend, had a panic attack while drunk. she forced me to seek a therapist, and without that i likely would have been making this post. i cried on the way back home with her, and she was right there for me, realizing how fucked up i was. to say that it was all perfect though would be an oversight. we did break up during the semester and she did see someone for a one time thing. i decided not to hold it against her because of what she meant to me, and because it was totally stupid on her part. we would bicker at times too, often times because i would say something stupid because of a lack of social skills and her belief that she was fragile. yet it still worked until about middle of the semester where she greened out at a party and woke up to a guy who made a move on her. that was some final straw for her, and i think it broke her on some level and we broke up for the second time. assuming she needed time to figure things out, i started talking to close friends about the incident to get their opinions. i spoke to one of them who i forgot was a mandatory reporter. for the sake of brevity, i had to make a police report, and the night i made it she got a phone call from the local police department and the next day three officers showed up in her school. she screamed at me, but i knew what was at stake and what i had just done. her family lived on a knifes edge, and she was trying to repair her relationship with her mom. her friends could have started asking questions, possibly leaving her. her freedom became questionable, as she was getting high again, which was the reason in the summer she had got in so much trouble. but nothing happened. and i had to fix this. i hadn’t played piano in 10 years, yet two days after she screamed at me, i began again. in 10 days, i learned the song that symbolized the entire thing to me. i originally gave myself a window of 14 days, but i was ready. i recorded it and sent it to her, with the best apology i could have come up with. “it’s beautiful, but it doesn’t change anything.”and i knew that. but again in vain i still tried, i promised myself i would be home for her birthday so i was. i had already started on her gift and gave it to her. i just wanted to have a true conversation with her about all of this. to get closure and to understand what the future would hold. i have her my gift and asked her to talk to me, so we did. we talked for two hours. it came down to us being fundamentally different people, but agreeing we were each other’s best. that we could not be friends because the feelings would be to great. that we should try to move on from each other, and maybe decades down the line reconnect. when we hugged as a final goodbye, my throat hitched. she pulled away and put her hand on my face. she realized what she did immediately, but that was the moment that i became me. that i started to close off again.it was like this until she wished me happy birthday. she was the only one to do so, because i tell no one about it. but even my best friends didn’t say a word, so it meant something to me. i’m hindsight it was rather innocuous, but i dwelled on it for a little while. then walking through the city with my family it happened for the first time. i was looking at christmas lights and i saw us. laughing, looking up at the lights, holding each other. i blinked and it was gone. those moments have been happening occasionally since, in places that meant something to me or to us. i will see us in the perfect instagram ready photo, and it will ruin me for the day. i’ve tried my best to move on, got a tinder, started talking to as many people as possible. nothing works, and i realized it’s because i’ve been given the gift of caring for others: not flirting. so i’m going to delete my tinder and make sure that i’m not so stupid moving forward. about a week ago, i noticed her instagram post were getting progressively more depressing. she blocked me and unblocked in a span of 12 hours. i decided to say something, not as someone wanting her back, but as someone who was genuinely concerned. she said she was fine, and we texted until i got a one word response. now to summarize: we have the girl who broke me out of my shell and helped me experience life. who probably stopped me from someday killing myself. who was the one who taught me what true love really meant. and that i ruined in one action, to destroy any future chance i had. what i want now is what i wanted two months ago. i want this fixed, and i want to be able to hold her again. i decided this january i would think about making another attempt to reconnect, but if it seems too much i won’t. i really think it’s done and over with. i don’t need to hear the crap about “there’s so many other fish in the sea.” i know there are. but how many fish do you believe you owe your life to? that you think about every night? that you sometimes cry yourself to sleep over?if i had the chance again, i would live my life to the fullest with her. i’d change my dreams based on this one delusion. and i’m not sure if the world would agree with me. i just needed to put this in writing. if you’re still with me, am i crazy? i already know i’m depressed']\n",

      "['i almost killed myself. i’ve been so close to killing myself, so many times. i’ve sat night after night for years with a chefs knife on the counter and an x marked on my bare chest over my heart. i’ve sat atop tall buildings, apartment complexes and parking garages and what have you, and looked off the edge and thought about how easy it would be to end it all. to jump, and to fly, and to be free of all the worldly pains that we deal with every day. last night i sat at my desk, after a night out of drinking and a few arguments with friends, with a full bottle of pills and a bottle of vodka to wash them all down... but i didn’t. at 2am, i had rationalized in my brain that when i stopped crying and my phone was dead and the music stopped i would kill myself.  in my mind, it would be relief. i would be relieved of all the many tortures i had endured. at 3 o’clock, i took the first pill, made my first drink. but then at 3:30 i stopped myself. i put the pills back in the medicine cabinet and the liquor back in the drawer in my nightstand. i plugged my phone in and saw the messages from the people who love me convinced myself i could make it one more day. not for myself, because i truly don’t want to be here, but for the people who care. now... this is not to say that i stayed for the people who love me and know me best. not my mother, or my best friends, or the people with whom i choose to spend the most time. and these people do care, but they are not the reason i stay. i feel like those who know me so well would understand in a way. they would be sad of course, but i hope they might accept my decision. many of them may even say they felt it coming. however, i do it for the ones who care, not because they know, but out of the goodness of their hearts. i find that many times the people who seem to care and the people who keep me alive are the peripheral characters. those that, if life were a movie, would go largely unnoticed and unremembered. the people who i stay for are often friends that might not know you so well but always radiate positivity and care no matter how close an acquaintance you really are. oftentimes it is the person in the hallway that cracks a joke and makes you smile when you’re least expecting it. or the stranger on the street with the kind smile that manages to brighten your day.  in my own life, a guidance counselor who had no notion of what i struggled with and didn’t see the intricate details, but who always gave their best effort to help me achieve what i wanted. the parents of my friends, who may not know the details of my life, but spoke kindly of me regardless and we’re always happy to see me. many times it is the “extras” in the movie of life they give me hope or keep me going for one more day. and i wonder, were it not for those people, how many times over would i have died? how many of them realize the impact they have made? surely, they do not realize they are the ones who’ve kept me alive. all the same, it’s true. and i wonder, if i were ever to go through with my plans and kill myself, how would everyone react? who would cry at my funeral, and take a long time to sit and reflect? which of the people in my life would pass through quickly, pay their respects and move on? even more interestingly to me, who would be absent all together? for many people in my life i think i may be able to guess, but there are also a great many wildcards. i think, if i could stay after my death for a while, and seek the answers to these questions, and see how everyone heals, and even more interestingly who doesn’t heal, i would be more comfortable in taking the choice to leave. it isn’t the question of wanting to live or die that keeps me here for that is a question i answered long ago. right or wrong, it is the list of questions which i would leave with, unanswered that keep me alive. curiosity is a strange savior indeed.  i almost committed suicide last night, and i am alright with that. i’m at peace with my own mortality, and a part of me is still ready to die. i am beaten, in pain, down and depressed, and have felt this way for the better part of the last 5 years. but i didn’t kill myself. i didn’t down those pills, and for that i am still here. today i am alive, i woke up this morning again. i will not say i am happy, or proud of myself, as many people probably would. but i find it interesting. i am intrigued with this new day of my life. today has been a much calmer day. things are not all better, and i am still depressed']\n",

(i wish i could see a doctor or therapist, as well; however, my parents blow over every request i make to see one, since either a.) its a waste of money or b.) mental illness is all in your head).going back to my brother, he had an hour long conversation about my attitude and my depression']\n",

      "['i can barely distinguish what makes me feel depressed anymore. it’s as if my mind has lost its ability to individually pick out specific events/experiences that have happened to make me feel this way.  i used to be able to picture a drawer, and in each compartment i would be able to separate all my shitty moments apart, but now it’s as if something pushed the drawer onto the ground, spilling all its contents out and mixing in together to a point it’s impossible for me to discern one from another. to sum that up, i am so disappointed in my own brain.i’m being medicated and i’m still not sure if it’s working because i feel as though it has numbed my emotions/opinions of what i feel. despite all this i know that i will recover one day, but the thought of living the rest of my adolescent years out in depression terrifies me. i’m already sick to death of feeling like ass 24/7, i can’t even begin to imagine how badly my life would be affected if my depression isn’t gone by the time i’m a young adult. i just wish i could identify and seperate my ill thoughts because i know that would leave me some room for a more rational way of thinking.now, i’m not suicidal, and i definitely don’t plan on killing myself anytime soon but i’m scared of the next big horrible thing to happen to me because, what if that one event is a gateway to ‘succumbing’ to my depression']\n",

      "['i seem to be faring the worst because as of three months ago, i cant even go to work anymore without having panic attacks, and have quit working because of it.&#x200b;the reason im posting today is that my relationship with this friend feels unhealthy, and i dont know how to approach it anymore.  we worked together, and bonded over a shared sense of humor. lost contact for a few months, but started hanging out again about six months ago. ive been reluctant to start a relationship with anyone because of my fragile mental state, but she gave me attention and would send me funny things and ask me how i was all the time. after awhile i started to think maybe we could be something more. we talked about it a little bit, but after going back and forth seemed to realize that maybe it was best if we didnt take it further since we were both dealing with some serious stuff and didnt want to be destructive together. however, it was hard not to flirt and joke around when we hung out and texted, making the whole situation very confusing. to add to the mix, we tend to argue too. she says things that push my buttons really bad and i to her, and sometimes when we hang out i just end up feeling really frustrated. about a month ago, in a last ditch effort to \"see if we could make things work\" i asked her out for a sort of date. it went totally awry, me feeling like i was doing it for the wrong reasons, and we ended up going home early.  she recently started seeing someone else, and it has made me feel bad. it shouldnt because i had my chance to make things work and decided against it, but i cant help feeling a little bit hurt. part of me wants to end the friendship, because despite the fun times, there are a lot of frustrating times. its actually pretty funny because i feel like ive been friend zoned, something i havent felt for a long time. she talks to me like a friend and sometimes flirts, and then it all seems to be a tease somehow.  to complicate matters further, ive come to the realization that im a really negative person. i feel like i breed negativity in others lives, and a part of me wants to push everyone away so i wont hurt them. she is no angel either, so when were together, it sometimes feels like were in a contest to see who can be more insufferable. last time we hung out, i won that contest, and i thought, \"welp, she isnt gonna want to be friends with me anymore\", and then she texted me the next day. it gives me false hope. im always kept at arms length, and im honestly sick of it. but i feel like a jerk when i contemplate ending the friendship over some petty shit. so do i stay as this happy subordinate? even when i feel like im being treated poorly?  i should mention that i dont have many friends left. over the last few years my friendships have slowly eroded due to lack of care. i dont feel deserving to have friends, and eventually theyve stopped calling. i do think i deserve it, but damn loneliness sucks.  for those of you having gone through or going through depression, have you had a friendship with a similarly depressed']\n",

      "['i have always had \"problems\" internally, regardless of how i seemed to others. social anxiety for example. most social interaction felt strained, awkward, or uncomfortable. afterwards, i might ask someone else who was there, \"did i act normal?\". the response was usually \"yeah, of course, why did it not seem that way to you?\" i suppose i was just really good at hiding it.&nbsp;funny, most of these problems were ones i didnt even know i had. that is, until i met someone that helped achieve some buoyancy and get my head above the water for long enough to recognize my plight: i was very anxious.&nbsp;that was 8 years ago, and since that point i have learned more and more about what makes me tick, and why i am the way i am.&nbsp;the first realization was that i was transgender. for the next few years i spent most of my time doing some internal questioning about what that meant for me and what the next steps would be. i even attempted transition, but found that it provided no benefit to me in practical life. up until about a year ago, i thought this thing i knew about myself was the end-all-be-all. it explained everything i experienced, why social interactions were hard for me, and seemingly every other issue i could recall from my past. or so i thought.&nbsp;when you begin to dig really deep into gender and who you are compared to others, you may find that you arent so different...&nbsp;still, i knew what i needed to do, and that was transition, and transition i did. soon enough, however, it became clear that my life was no better than it was before, just different. i had traded one set of obstacles for another without any net gain. so i gave it up, and went back to being myself.&nbsp;that was about 6 months ago. still, the question remained: if so many people out there are able to achieve a modicum of peace and success in their lives despite hurdles like that, why cant i?&nbsp;i began looking at my upbringing. i found that from my perspective, my family seemed loving and relatively happy. i was the son of a single mother of two, who was the daughter of a successful stock broker and home-making wife, whom had 4 healthy kids, all who had kids themselves. we spent christmases and thanksgivings together as a family, with smiles and laughs and all the things you could hope for growing up.&nbsp;i had a father who tried to be a dad, at least when i was younger, but had a lot of mental issues including addiction, alcoholism, and general assholery. eventually our relationship went from distant to non-existent. i didnt know his family.&nbsp;i loved my family, or at least thought i did...im not as sure now (since love itself is in question). like i said, i have little outside perspective, so its hard for me to see what issues there might be. and as a disclaimer: im thankful for what ive had. i really couldnt have asked for a better childhood, i had a lot of really care-free times as a kid. but since i have failed in all aspects of life, from relationships to work over and over, i have to ask questions.&nbsp;couple things to point out: almost every member of the family has dealt with anxiety or depression, or is dealing with them now. when we meet, its almost an assumed thing that one of us is dealing with it at any given time, since its hard to hide when you know someone. &nbsp;second thing: appearances have always been of utmost priority to my family. the general rule is: if youre not happy, look happy, or try to hide your sadness as best as you can. if youre angry, dont be direct, that might hurt someones feelings or cause an issue, and we dont want issues.&nbsp;ive spent time with other families, and they might give each other shit, maybe even argue or fight from time to time. that never happened in my family save for a couple of occasions. that brings me to the relationship with my mom: we never fought. ever. disagreements were mild, with my mom usually relenting to my view on things to save from having hard conversations. didnt do my chores? an exhasperated laugh followed by\"i really wish you wouldve done them.\" and then id feel guilty enough to do them. a couple years ago i started to realize that i felt like if i truly were to go against her wishes, she would abandon me. whether that would happen or not, i dont know, but it was this deep, existential feeling that i could never overcome, and is still there. like im on the verge of being abandoned by the only person that cares.&nbsp;she also seems to be completely unable to offer any emotional support, though not for lack of trying. she will listen to me explain how im feeling, and try to offer solutions, but somehow i come away feeling worse. ive learned not to talk about feeling bad around her because things only get worse.&nbsp;she also has some major depression']\n",

yeah, i go with my parents to the movies, but i still feel…ashamed of what they know about me? i just feel upset they know something i don’t want them to know? they still love me, but….i have a hard time loving them back and it breaks my heart…and i feel it’s all because of this stupid fetish.why did i grow up wanting to humiliate myself so badly? what’s the reason for that?about two months ago i decided i had enough. i was just sick of everything and wanted to change. so i threw away all my diapers, dresses, panties, dildos, bras, and rubber pvc suits into the trash. i just had enough. i stopped masturbating for two months now and i just never want to return to that darkness.i hate how people say you should love yourself and accept yourself for what you like. life is short, so enjoy yourself and accept your fetishes. but thats not who i want to be. i dont want to grow up any longer with these fetishes holding me back in life.the worst part about this is my family knows. my sister found all my diapers and was disgusted and threw them in the trash. i meekly just fished them out of the trash and put them back in the box and hid them in the basement.i just wish i never had this fetish since it caused me so much self hate and loathing. no woman is going to enjoy humiliating her so in diapers and love them. okay, sure...maybe there will be someone out there, but its just an unrealistic fantasy.i also heavily watched humiliation porn. i watched diaper porn just about everyday. i looked at cartoons and hentai depicting diaper humiliation. i read erotica and comics involving this fetish. i even spent money on porn videos and also dominatrixes. ive just been through a lot. i got very deep into this fetish.i just...wanted to stop indulging in this stupid fetish which does nothing good for me. if it was acceptable, i wouldnt be feeling so depressed and suicidal over it. yeah, i feel suicidal over a fucking diaper fetish, isnt that insane?just look at my post history and see how fucked up i am. im miserable, lonely, and depressed']\n",

      "['i have a humiliation fetish that involves me getting off on being humiliated in diapers and dresses. i thought i could just accept this fetish as a harmless thing and it wasnt a big deal. i thought maybe i just need to find the right woman or something. but it has caused me tons and tons of pain. growing up i had no friends. i was picked on and teased. i was put on medication and taken to therapy. every day i would masturbate to fantasies of diaper humiliation. this fetish caused me to isolate myself and keep quiet because i didnt want anyone to know my secret. i was shy and quiet and scared of other kids because i didnt want them to know my secret.i thought i could just accept it and move on. but i just couldnt. it just caused me nothing but pain and misery and i wanted to quit. i tried throwing my panties and diapers away, but it just never worked. i kept returning back to my fetish.growing up i did a lot of shameful things to get off. i remember crossdressing at around the age of 8 or so. for some reason, i just had this strong urge to wear a skirt. and things just built up from there. i used towels and doggy training pads and stapling them together to create a diaper. i remember using towels and my sister’s puffy jacket to create diapers. i remember shitting myself and pissing myself in the shower. i remember wearing multiple pairs of tighty whities to create a diaper. all these shameful things i did growing up, feel like trauma. i feel traumatized by what i did to myself.i just feel sick to my stomach thinking of this stuff. it really haunts me that i did all of these shameful things to myself. i’m embarrassed by myself. and i remember cumming all over a canvas in my room and calling it at one time, and my mother finding it and being disgusted. i was a fucked up kid growing up.my relationship with my mother is strained. it’s hard to look her in the eye with her knowing all of these horrible things about me. she still loves me no matter what, and i just feel so ashamed of myself that i just want to die.i’m just so fucking ashamed of myself for growing up like this. i thought i could just accept this as a simple fetish. but it just doesn’t feel like it. i thought i could join fetlife and meet other people like me, but that just isnt going to solve anything.i’m ashamed of myself for growing up and masturbating every day to fantasies of diaper humiliation. i’m just so sick of it i just want to stop.everyone always says i look so sad or upset. at work, i was told by multiple people that i look sad, upset, miserable and bored. my coworker asked me why i look so sad and upset and asked what was wrong. my manager said he was worried about me.it’s not like i can tell people why i’m depressed. i’m depressed because i have a fetish that ruined a lot of my life. i just can’t talk to people about it. i feel alone in the regard. i feel like my diaper/crossdressing humiliation fetish caused the majority of my depression. i felt alone. i felt like a freak. i grew up doing these horrible and embarrassing things to myself, i feel so fucked up and warped from the damage i did.how do i become comfortable with my family? yeah, i go with my parents to the movies, but i still feel…ashamed of what they know about me? i just feel upset they know something i don’t want them to know? they still love me, but….i have a hard time loving them back and it breaks my heart…and i feel it’s all because of this stupid fetish.why did i grow up wanting to humiliate myself so badly? what’s the reason for that?about two months ago i decided i had enough. i was just sick of everything and wanted to change. so i threw away all my diapers, dresses, panties, dildos, bras, and rubber pvc suits into the trash. i just had enough. i stopped masturbating for two months now and i just never want to return to that darkness. i hate how people say you should love yourself and accept yourself for what you like. life is short, so enjoy yourself and accept your fetishes. but thats not who i want to be. i dont want to grow up any longer with these fetishes holding me back in life.the worst part about this is my family knows. my sister found all my diapers and was disgusted and threw them in the trash. i meekly just fished them out of the trash and put them back in the box and hid them in the basement.i just wish i never had this fetish since it caused me so much self hate and loathing. no woman is going to enjoy humiliating her so in diapers and love them. okay, sure...maybe there will be someone out there, but its just an unrealistic fantasy.i also heavily watched humiliation porn. i watched diaper porn just about everyday. i looked at cartoons and hentai depicting diaper humiliation. i read erotica and comics involving this fetish. i even spent money on porn videos and also dominatrixes. ive just been through a lot. i got very deep into this fetish. i just...wanted to stop indulging in this stupid fetish which does nothing good for me. if it was acceptable, i wouldnt be feeling so depressed and suicidal over it. yeah, i feel suicidal over a fucking diaper fetish, isnt that insane?just look at my post history and see how fucked up i am. im miserable, lonely, and depressed']\n",

      "['i was 16, i realised something might be wrong. i was very introverted all of a sudden, hated human interactions, and couldnt stop worrying about things. i was never happy; always gloomy. those should have been my first signs.when i was 17, i always felt troubled. i dont know why but i just couldnt feel spirited in any way. i thought maybe, somehow, it was because somewhere deep down i thought it was cool to be emo and i was doing it subconciously. it wasnt.and at 18 i finally confronted the fact that i have been suffering from depression. that realisation didnt ease things; instead, it created frequent anxiety attacks, migraine, worries and just in general feeling shitty. this would go on for 3 years or so. i would have nightmares and like dark illusions and panic attacks and social anxiety and sometimes it got so bad i somehow ended up sleeping with my eyes open unconciously (yes this is a thing). one of the things i found myself saying a lot was \"sorry\", even if it wasnt my fault. because i always felt inferior and undeserving inside. so things like suggestions and people telling me things they forgot to tell me; id say sorry anyway. and i hated that self.it doesnt help that depression is misappropriated severely. people either think depression isnt a thing, or they claim to have depression and wear it like it is an accessory so that they could get what they wanted around others. my ex girlfriend told me that i had no reason to be depressed and gave me a good scolding; that she had a better reason to be depressed but wasnt, and that i should grow up and suck it uo. that hurts.this year, i was forced to really grow up; not because someone told me to. but because one of my close friends killed himself over suicide; one tried to kill himself and i was the last person he contacted and i had to save him; while the other, a new friend i made actively confides in me and shows me the result of her self harm (it isnt pretty). i am forced to be in a position to be there for people and it isnt easy.it is a coping mechanism of sorts; it has forced me to be there for people who may need me more. but it has also been extremely tiring even when i know i need to be there for others.sometimes, i cant even explain why i feel lethargic, sad or moody and i just want to be left alone; yet other times i just want to be the weak one just so that others around me will gice a damn for once. yet, it becomes very difficult to voice all these out in a conservative asian society that severely undermines and judges depression']\n",

i miss being in complete aww, just taking in a moment of beauty.. you know what i see with a phone.. a bill.. a reminder that no one’s texted me, an outlet that means you are connected to the world, 24/7, never getting a break.. i check it.. no matches on tinder either aha why the fuck did i even sign up for that?..it comes time for dinner and we had your favorite.. cooked ham with that string bean casserole my aunt makes. it wasn’t as good as the years passed, but i think it was only because you weren’t there to remind me how good it was.. you would have psyched because i think she even added extra onion straws we’re eating around the table and i’m sitting at the head, because everyone wanted to sit next to their so’s, and there was only one chair at the end.. i volunteer as tribute, because why not? let them enjoy the time.. i know it’s not that big a deal, and they wouldn’t even mind, but things just happened that way..i think that’s where i made the mistake.. pretty much just asking to be talked to by those relatives who i only see three times a year..then it happened.. i hadn’t seen or talked to these relatives in a long time“hey dugefrsh, where’s [my girlfriend]? at her parents today? i made extra casserole just for her!”it’s kind of cliche to say especially because people say it a lot.. but it was like a scene from a movie..the kitchen becomes pretty quiet and she could tell she messed up and gave me a sad look to say i’m sorry. how was she supposed to know? it’s okayi play it off and just smile “ haha she’s doing well, her and her mother are on vacation this week i believe, so they’re out of state”the sigh of brief relief that swept over her face didn’t last long and she kept asking about her and telling me how cute she was and how she was so much fun to talk to..the line that hurt most was when she said she fit in perfect with our family..“she was perfect i know aunty”and it’s sort of my fault too i guess, i could have just told her that we’re not together anymore and been done with it, but i didn’t want to embarrass her finally my dad coughed and i told her we were no longer seeing each other anymore..play it off coy, everyone gets back to chatting and the situation rolls over.. i don’t usually drink a red wine, but we were out of white and i didn’t want a beer. i sat there at the head of the table playing with a bowl of jellybeans, and i even picked out all the black ones and put them off to the side, sort of like i was saving them for you.. i can’t believe you liked those you weirdo hahai finally had a moment without thinking about you today though.. the bruins game was on and was a welcome distraction; that and the alcohol was helpingwhen the game finishes up all the kids want to watch frozen.. i can’t do that..when i would sing do you wanna build a snowman to you and you’d laugh.. i can’t do it..thankfully though my parents wanted to leave.. as i’m in the back seat again, the pulsing of the passing street lamps make it a little hard to close my eyes.. when i’m staring at the stars, it’s such a lame, grandiose and romanticized way of thinking, but i knew they were the same stars that you were looking at.. it hit me that that was one time i was in aww.. looking at stars with you..after i finish this drink, i’m gonna try and get some rest though..if i’m lucky i’ll just pass out and don’t have to cry too long..maybe i’ll start the moving on process?.. it’s never taken me this long to get over someone..maybe i’ll try it in the morning.. maybe tomorrow will be the day i beat this stupid depression']\n",

      "['i decided to clean our bathroom early in the morning and finally unpack the boxes from our move in september (been a busy year). he was downstairs playing botw. i let him play since i felt i needed to do this task by myself. he hears me cleaning and offers help. of course i say yes because i realized that i took on more than i can clean. i find a bottle of medical lotion, so i get up to look up what its used for. while im reading the bottle and walking out of the bathroom to get my phone my husband asks me to hand him the trash bag hanging from the door. i get annoyed and tell him to get it himself because i was so focused on figuring out what this lotion was for.  he gets mad at me and we have a small fight. after we clean the bathroom (barely speaking to each other) i just decided to lay in bed a watch tv. i laid in bed for at least 4+ hours. i eventually go downstairs and tell him whats going on with me and i was sorry for getting mad at him. we spent the rest off the day watching tv, playing games and napping. we eat dinner and watch more tv. after a few episodes of b99 i decide to take a hot oatmeal bath. while im waiting for the tub to fill i ask him to bring me the switch so i can play it during my bath. he tells me no that its not a good idea because it could get wet. he is right but after a long week of emotional exhaustion, playing botw in a hot bathtub sounds like the perfect way to end the week. we bicker about that for a minute until he finally brings it to me. i checked my tub and of course its almost ice cold. i tried filling it with a few gallons of boiling hot water and its still isnt mother of dragons hot. i get angry, drain the tub, slam all the doors in my bedroom and lay in bed. he comes up and asked if i am ok. i say yes just so he will leave me alone. he keeps asking and i get even more mad and snap at him. he storms off pissed at me. so i decided i didnt want him or the dog to sleep in the room with me. i grab his pillows and the dogs bed and throw them down to the living room where he and the dog are watching tv. i lay in bed seething with anger and frustration.i dont want to keep pushing my husband away with my depression']\n",

(this is the combination of anedonias \"nothing matters anyway\" and adhds \"lets flood you with a thousand thoughts and make you forget why you even had the thought in the first place.\")none of this happened. it tried to for a second, then i just said \"fuck it, this is my body, i can make it do these things\" (getting all the stuff out and setting it up), so i started doing it.within an hour i had a song, then another, then another, etc. the next day was the same, i was in chat rooms about music, talking about my hobby oh my god, its my hobby, i have a hobby, a thing i love doing!!!. sorry for the caps, but this realization hit me.its only been a week, but the effects have been stable. im not super excited and hyped up, i can just think of doing something and start doing it. and as im doing it, i dont constantly have this negative voice devaluing what im doing or sapping all the joy out of it. im not plagued by a suicidal cheer leader who wants nothing more than to make me give up and lay there till i die.i say all of this because i know what depression feels like. theres always the chance that ill have to adjust my meds in the future as one med becomes less effective or whatever. all i can say is that for the first time in a while, i feel like hope actually exists in the world.im glad i talked to my psychologist about dealing with adhd. i havent treated adhd since i was a late teen, and i only treated it for a short period of my life. had i not brought up the topic of adulthood adhd, i wouldnt have found out that an antipsychotic medication (haloperidol) could quiet that shitty nagging \"nothing you do matters\" voice in my head and let me reconnect with the things i used to enjoy.i hope whatever your method of action, please believe me when i tell you. ive spent the last 4 years of my life being absolutely certain that depressed or not depressed, joy was a lie i used to tell myself and id somehow figured out that nothing joyful was ever real.here i am, only a week later and its like the heaviest darkest fog has been removed from in front of my eye, or pulled out of my heart.i hope you find the will to keep trying to beat your depression']\n",

      "['i just want to write it down somewhere, maybe it will help. im a college senior in my early 20s. since my teen years, probably starting around 17 or 18, ive been on a rollercoaster of ups and downs, each of which usually last a few months at a time, although it varies. my initial, long ago feelings of depression stemmed from not knowing how to talk or interact with girls, having been a sheltered youth that went to an all boys high school. i went through several years thinking i wasnt good enough for anyone, feeling immense loneliness even though i had plenty of guy friends that truly liked and cared about me.well i finally learned a few years ago kinda how to get girls. and when this happened my rollercoaster went to one of its highest \"ups\" ever. i was meeting and sleeping with girls, finally. i loved it.  last year, i met a girl who became absolutely infatuated with me. she loved and adored me. she told me this numerous times. we were perfectly compatible in bed. perfectly compatible. at the point of meeting her i had already had several partners and she was the first one that made me truly enjoy sex. she desired me. i desired her. the whole time i was \"with\" her (with in quotations because i never dated her, we kinda just texted a lot and had sex on the weekends) i basically treated her like shit. took her for granted. i thought,subconsciously, \"look how much this girl loves and wants me, i must be the shit, i dont really need her cause i can get any girl i want.\" the confidence boost of having someone love me so much and think i was so attractive made me think any girl could feel the same way about me. so after about 9 months, i told her i wanted to stop seeing her.she was devastated. begged me not to go. i said no, were not meant for each other. i didnt see her for 2 months over the summer. i had no girls, and i missed her, but i was still confident in myself. i still thought i was attractive, had a lot to offer. but i missed her. i realized i made a mistake. and i texted her saying so. and she said sorry, but i wasted too much time on you, someone who constantly told me that they didnt love me, so now i started seeing someone else. so now shes gone. its been several months since then, and i havent talked to her since, besides one little hiccup in the middle where we talked for a day, but its irrelevant to this post. i still think about how good i had it, and i still miss her every day, and i always think about how stupid i was to throw it away. in the moment i didnt think i even liked her, but i guess its true that you dont know what you have till its gone. well if this was all i had to deal with, i would be ok because eventually i believe i would be able to find another girl. but over the summer, i started losing my hair, rapidly. im 22. i know this isnt stress related because 1. early onset baldness runs in my family, and 2. i started a drug to help my hair loss (which i had noticed last year before it started to get really bad) and stopped the drug because i felt like it was not working. well. my hair had become dependent on the drug, and began to really recede and thin out rapidly. so. im balding at 22. i am a tall, skinny, very pale, babyface guy who cant grow a beard and has a large skull with a narrow face. i cannot pull off the bald look. at all. i can look at pictures of myself from 4 months ago and see a very noticeable difference in how i look. i used to be a youthful looking attractive guy who got compliments from girls all the time. now i feel like an old man, in a matter of months. i have zero confidence left. absolutely none. i spend all day every day thinking about my hairline, taking and analyzing pictures of myself, going to the bathroom every 20 minutes just to see if my hair looks ok. i feel, in my heart, that my dating life is over. i feel like no girl will ever want me again. i was so confident in myself and my looks 4 months ago, and now, nothing.  this makes my regret for ending my relationship increase 1000x. i had someone that loved me for me, and was so animalistically attracted to me, and i was to her, and now its done forever. i will never have that again. and if i made a different decision a few months ago i couldve had it for the rest of my life, even if i was bald.people will tell me to lower my standards, but im attracted to what im attracted to. my standards used to be attainable. now i feel like theyre not. and my hair situation will never get better, only worse. im 22 and i feel like the prime of my life is over.all these things have led me to being depressed']\n",

(i’m biased - i like cooking.) they view the aesthetic as a way of finding catharsis - it helps (in my case) curb the feeling of loneliness when you see someone else who seems like they may understand where you’re at, or at the very least, it helps you connect with people who have similar tastes to yours.hell, it’s more of a pastel-aesthetic, but i just wore my teddy fresh sweatshirt to the optometrist today, and my doctor was *super* cool and mentioned she had the same sweatshirt - turns out her and her husband are huge h3 fans, and we might all be going to catch a drink soon!i find that the depression aesthetic helps me find expression and catharsis. but this is just my opinion. i haven’t done nearly enough reading on it, and i’m super curious on what you lot think. ——- what are your thoughts on the depression aesthetic?are people who take on the style watering down the public image of depression']\n",

(this was the summer after my 5th grade) when i got home that day i didnt want to shower because i thought a bug would fly into one of my orifices and lay eggs or something, which was somewhat justified as we had an earwig problem. i wouldnt brush my teeth because i was too worried about swallowing a bit of toothpaste and being poisoned. when i washed my hands, i kept my mouth closed out of fear that soap would splash in there, yet i still washed them excessively, and i mean like every five minutes excessively. even my moms boyfriend, who was ocd himself, was getting pissed at me. i would hoard spit in my cheek rather than swallow if i thought there was anything toxic in there. this went on for a good couple of years throughout middle school, where i was more concerned about imaginary things killing me than my grades, or at least thats how i like to justify it. by eighth and ninth grade i was a pariah, a class clown who tried too hard to make friends, and i dont remember having any.so maybe thats why i miss being in a toxic relationship. maybe if i build up someone in my mind like i did with her, i can feel happy about myself because im with her. but that wasnt the case, i constantly worried about where we stood even at the best of our relationship. she wanted to marry me, but circumstances kept us from seeing each other and i always worried what she was doing. was she seeing someone else? that kind of thing. and i was right. she got back with her ex and told me we needed a break, and that shed let me know her choice in a month. that broke me. i was so fucking miserable i broke it off with her totally, leaving casualties in the form of a big rant over the phone about the douche she was dating and all but telling her to go to hell. it was the first time i had stood up to someone like that, and it lasted. i was an easygoing guy (on the outside anyway) until my senior year, when this happened, and i spent the rest of high school in a state of...idk, not really apathy but sort of defensively. i ignored our mutual friends assuming they had all sided with her, but i did end up dating a girl we both knew. we got too serious while i was still resentful over my ex, and it was this attitude that drove her away too.months later when im reconnecting with an old friend, i learn that, in fact, a number of my friends had sided with me but i never bothered trying to approach them. fuck. i spent my last year of school miserable for no good reason, i didnt even go to my prom or walk at graduation because i thought people hated my guts. and i cant shake that feeling, i work in retail yet i get more and more dismissive and resentful as time passes. ive become cynical as fuck and its pushed away said old friend. i want to write fiction as a career and i draw occasionally, and im less and less motivated to do either of them because im always so angry and exhausted from work. im really insecure about my body on top of all that, i was pretty fat through middle school but i managed to burn it through high school and now im a twig. im not even tall enough to be skinny, i found out recently im 511 after years of assuming im at least 6 feet because of the shorter women i dated. and the dude my ex left me for is at least 62. i dont buy into redpill shit or anything but it was pretty crushing. ive kind of grown to...not idolize, but look to slasher films as inspiration to stay strong back when i was alone in school, like friday the 13th, so i could feel tough and project some kind of confidence. i fucking hate myself for having to look at fictional serial killers for self esteem. not to mention theyre mostly, if not all at least six feet tall.i dont even remember what the point of posting this was, im more depressed']\n",

      "['i believed that i would never get better. i was intent on killing myself and it enraged me when people would try to tell me it would get better. so if you’re in that place as you’re reading this, bear with me. because depression & suicide runs in my family, i was lucky enough to be surrounded by loved ones who are very educated about mental illness. on an afternoon, at a time when i already had my suicide plan in place, my granny (grandma) shared some stories with me about other family members who had killed themselves. in the process of talking about this, she shared some very specific ways that those deaths (some of them over 35 yrs ago) affect her & my papa (grandpa) to this day. she also explained to me in great detail the specific way our health care system works in regards to mental health & urged me to take the necessary steps (which she clearly laid out for me) to see a psychiatrist. after that conversation, i decided that i would wait until she & my papa had passed away before killing myself. for her, i went to see the psychiatrist although i definitely did not believe it would make a difference. when there’s awareness about mental health it makes identification & treatment possible. without my granny’s knowledge & willingness to both talk & listen, i would be dead. i had previously experienced four other major depressive episodes in my life. in each of those scenarios, i would eventually end up both in counselling to talk about it & at the doctor’s office for prescriptions. it would take months (& often many med changes) before i noticed any difference. after seeing a psychiatrist who had the necessary knowledge to talk about the right things and prescribe the right cocktail of medication at the same time, i literally felt like a different person after two weeks.awareness promotes knowledge, knowledge allows for the correct treatment, & when the proper treatment is applied, recovery is faster.mental health awareness is so important to me because its presence in my world has allowed me to feel the joy and contentment that laying down with a cup of tea & three sweet dogs sleeping on top of me brings. so first, i just want to encourage each of us to speak out during the times we have the strength and ability to do so. our struggle is not one to be ashamed of. and last, if you’re depressed']\n",

      "['i got a normal 9-5 internship, i had my studies, my sports and i was in a board. we were both so busy and thus only had time in the weekends. she also didnt like living at my place and couldnt get along with my dad. so we were looking for our own place, but couldnt find anything. she tried to break up with me after 3 months, but gave me a second chance. she eventually left me after 5 months.my life has been ruined. i was already suffering from some sort of depression since my childhood, probably dystymic, but now i got diagnosed with having a severe acute depression. i feel so empty without her, so alone. i keep thinking of my time with her and how happy i was, and how stupid i am for ruining it not once but twice! i absolutely hate myself. i have so much guilt and regrets for nkt being able to make her happy. im also scared of the future as i dont know what i want to do or could do, and im already 24. i have days were i only sleep and dont even eat or drink. in the past 3 months ive had emotional ups and downs within days, sometimes hours. i switch between being sad, desperate, angry and somewhat motivated constantly. i cant control it. i hardly do anything. the only thing i did was finding a place for myself and get help. i still havent moved in though and i just started seeing  a psychologist.i dont know why i acted the way i did towards my ex. i was selfish, unloving, immature, irresponsible, mean and just not investing time in her. i love her so much though. its this immense feeling deep inside me, but its like i cant really express it her. its as if there are two persons in my head. one who is positive, motivated, wants to give love and wants to take action. the other is negative, inactive, and not empathetic. usually the last one wins. its like i wasnt really in control the last months of the relationship. i feel so conflicted with myself. my head feels like exploding and my heart as if it could stop anytime. i just want to die every day. just so everything stops. i thought of slitting my wrists, electrocuting myself or taking sleeping pills. i almost cut my wrist, but i couldnt do it. i just cant anymore...i did some small tests which are indicating i could have narcissistic personality disorder, borderline, anxiety, autism, and sociopathic traits. so thats on top of my depression']\n",

      "['i begged her to stay and eventually she decided to stay.in april i showed her more love and things went pretty well. however, at the end of the month and especially in may things turned for the worse again. we got back into the drag and the love and intimacy faded again. about halfway may she apparently had enough and searched for her own place in the city she works in without telling me. two weeks later she had packed her stuff and told me she was leaving. again she told me she didnt love me anymore and that she wanted to leave. she just didnt believe in me anymore, that i could make her happy and she didnt want to commit to me. i helped her move the next day and managed to convince her to take a break. this only lasted 3 days because i stupidly called her up in an emotional state. she got angry and then really broke up with me.i was completely shocked both times when she wanted to break up with me. for me it came all out of nowhere. i managed to see her some days after the break up to talk about it. after having analyzed all that happened the past few months, i was convinced that it was just due to the stressful situation we were in. she told me that wasnt the case. she just said she doesnt love me anymore, that she doesnt believe i can make her happy, and that we do not fit in our core. i also told her that i made mistakes, but i was mostly putting the blame on the situation. we decided to stay friends. she still liked me and i suspect she still has feelings for me because she was very conflicted and emotional about breaking up with me. perhaps those are just high hopes though.ever since the break-up, i have been a complete wreck. i cried and raged for days. i didnt eat and couldnt sleep. i got a break from my internship. i failed two exams. i felt incredibly depressed and even suicidal. i just wanted to end it. occasionally, i felt motivated. i was desperately trying to look for ways to get her back. i contacted relationship experts and bought some of their products. i also talked to family and friends about it. surprisingly, i managed to get a place of my own. my situation didnt get better though. i did have contact with my ex, but progress was slow. after a month or so i got professional help because it was all getting out of hand. a psychologist diagnosed me so far with having an acute depression. a friend of mine also suggested me a book about narcissism as he himself is a narcissist and recognized a lot of the traits in me.fast forward to now and my situation has still not improved. i still long for my ex. i love her deeply and even consider her the love of my life. i feel extremely depressed and suicidal. i also dont feel like i am somebody as if im an empty shell. i dont know what to do with my life anymore, im not motivated at all and i have constant panic attacks because i fear losing my ex forever, never getting her back. i am getting professional help, but its a slow process. i was referred to a clinical psychologist who i had my intake with just yesterday. my next meeting is in two weeks.looking at myself and back at the last months of the relationship, i have the feeling that im mentally ill. i suspect that i either have a narcissistic personality disorder or a borderline personality disorder. its hard to say though as im no professional, but there is clearly something wrong in my head. i was completely oblivious to all the signals my girlfriend gave me. i was not empathetic and i was even mean to her, pushing her away. oddly enough, i love her deeply, more than anyone and anything, but for some reason i was not able to properly express that if i even did express it at all. i feel like there are two persons in my head: the one that feels, has dreams and ideas and wants to act on it vs. the one that is selfish, mean, negative and just keeps me from actually doing things. it feels like a constant battle in my head which is often own by the latter person.i suspect that many of my mental issues originate from my traumatic childhood. my parents divorced when i was 2, resulting in a long nast custody battle. i did not get to see my dad for 4 years because my mom had used me to get back at my dad by claiming he had sexually abused me which wasnt true. eventually, when i was 6 my mom died of cancer. i was never able to love my mom after knowing she used me and im actually glad she is dead. anyway, me and my two brothers then had to live with my dad, a man that was a stranger to me. money was tight, my dad became an alcoholic, and he was constantly fighting with my oldest brother. this went on for years. all my dads attention went towards my brothers and all he cared about with me were my school results. i got into a lot of trouble at school and with authorities in my youth. ever since i was 12 i have felt depressed, never able to feel really happy. i was suicidal and self-harming. at 18 i even tried to commit suicide, but luckily failed. all my life i have felt alone and unsupported until i met the girl who is now my ex. it was such a great relationship. we loved each other so much and things went almost perfect, rarely having a fight. i could not have imagined a better relationship. i was really happy with her. though sometimes i was still feeling down, unhappy or depressed']\n",

      "['i was 21 living in the netherlands. she initially invited me over to have fun, but we fell in love and decided for a long distance relationship (ldr). we had a near perfect ldr for 2,5 years. finally, in january this year she came to live with me. we were so happy. though things quickly turned bad. even though we were used to being together for long periods of time (2 month of constantly being together for example), it didnt work out the way we wanted. we both got full time jobs but with different time schedules. so we barely saw each other during the workweek. then in the weekends we failed to spend quality time together. she also didnt feel comfortable at home, because we lived with my dad. we were looking for our own place, but we had no luck. we didnt have big fights, just small fights that would increasingly frustrate us. due to my narcissistic behaviour, i pushed her away and took her for granted (i didnt recognize that at the time; didnt even realize i was a narcissist). she even gave me a second chance, but i failed to fix the issues since i didnt know what was wrong. besides all that, she is only 19 now and i was her first ever boyfriend. she had occasional thoughts of exploring and experimenting with other people, but she loved me so she wouldnt leave. though in the last few months in the relationship her love for me obviously faded and the single life became more attractive to her (also due to her new work/social environment). anyway, she broke up with me, saying she doesnt love me anymore; that she doesnt believe i can make her happy; that she cant commit to a lifelong relationship now; that she thinks we dont fit together in our core. i was shocked and heartbroken. i truly and deeply love her and i admit that i made a lot of mistakes in the last months of the relationship. i wish i could go back and do everything differently because i feel an enormous amount of guilt towards her. i also know that a lot of the mistakes i made come from my own emotional instability (e.g. narcissism). since the break up i have thought of her every day, i cried, i hurt myself, i even want to kill myself sometimes. i feel incredibly depressed']\n",

      "['i have been formally introduced to our horrible friend depression. its hard to call it a friend, but it hangs around me more than anyone else i know.just to give some background, my first time with depression was a bit tough, but i got over it. second time around (last year) was really bad. i dropped out of classes, didnt have a job, and stayed in bed all day long for about 3 months. i didnt try hiding it because i was so exhausted, my friends and family tried helping but it was useless. after about 6 months, i got through it. like, completely. i felt that i was 110%...open to new experiences, had a good self-esteem, and was excelling generally in my personal life.a few months ago, the symptoms started returning slowly. because of my previous affair with depression, i was a bit more prepared this time around. i was going to a psychiatrist and we upped my dosage at the first signs.fast-forward 3 months to today, and i feel like im stuck in a limbo. im working 3-4 days a week. going out and having fun every now and then. but every morning is almost impossible to get out of bed. when im not in bed, i want to be and go curl up under the covers to try and sleep it off.this time around is not as bad as last year, just because it hasnt completely taken over. but i hate how i can tell that im not being myself. how i have to consciously remind myself to think positive thoughts, whether true or not. with depression, i always see the negative in everything...rational or not. i dont want to do anything new, and i dont want to hang with friends or family. i find myself getting away from groups, even of my closest friends, just to lay down in silence.im getting tired of having to push myself to do everyday tasks. but if i look back at my previous episodes, i should be feeling better soon. so far it has always started around september. it sounds a lot like seasonal depression, except i live in a tropical city where it never goes below 60 degrees and the sun is always out.i dont know why im writing this, just needing to vent i guess. i have a friend i can talk to, but i dont feel like burdening him with this. i feel like all im doing is complaining, and i dont need him to tell me to push through it.fuck depression']\n",

(maybe i’m just very suspicious)i thought/think their thought with taking me out was, getting me outside my comfort zone and try get me back to working out at a gym. cause i told my grandma i stopped working out and she looked pretty disappointed cause of that. she even payed me my membership once. (i quitted cause i had a pain i my neck 1 week then i got anxiety after that and didn’t wanna go)anyway, so already yesterday when i got that message i felt depressed cause they know i don’t have any friends or anything and felt like the biggest loser. i also knew that once i got into that car all that he would talk about was “get a job”, “driver license is important” etc. like my grandma and my parents and everyone tells me daily. but i just said “yes let’s do it” cause i got nothing to lose so.so fast forward to today. i get in the car, we drive, he starts talk about how i should get a job and how i should get a drivers license. how i gotta start somewhere. who would’ve thought right.then once we get into the gym my dads gf daughter that works there starts talking with him and she’s 17. aka 3 years younger then me. she looks so adult’y. they keep a conversation and she does great. she talks about how she gonna go to the grocery store and work and stuff. while i’m just standing next to my dads brother cause i have social anxiety and have nothing to say. i just stand there and tell myself how i’m not normal.then when we payed we go in and start working out it goes pretty well, he learned me some new workout exercises. the ones i thought i did well turned out i did a lot of wrong. i know i should be happy that he could correct the issues. instead i felt like i’m not good at anything. something is always wrong. if i think i do something right it’s always wrong somehow.anyway, the workout went great, i didn’t feel very motivated more like “whatever, let’s just get over with it.” i tried being “happy” like put on my mask but i couldn’t barely even do that. i tried my best but pretty sure he saw right through me how sad i was. i’m also very insecure so i just talked quietly and said “i don’t know” when he asked me or told me to do a new exercise with him. i kept telling myself how boring i am atm. how he doesn’t actually enjoy it, cause how quite and insecure and “sad” i was. i just felt like a burden.one last thing was that i kept seeing all these guys my age that looks hot as fire, (i’m gay) and how they socialise like normal people and i just felt so disconnected from the world. i tried being happy and positive during this “adventure” but it was just so hard.now i’m home feeling a lot more depressed']\n",

      "['i just got a girlfriend three days ago.   love of my life type of thing, you know? i loved her for a year or so, she rejected me all this time. had some suicide attempts during that (she knew of them, tried to talk me out of them, even wanted to help me and remain good friends), and had finally started to get it in my head that she didnt like me.  last weekend, after two nights of long, serious conversations with her (keep in mind, she was the closest person i had, no matter she didnt like me romantically. to my knowing, i am too, as she usually really keeps her feelings and experiences to herself and doesnt like change and stuff), we decided we had to end our pseudo-relationship. i guess i have to add in the fact that we had quite a bit of intimacy for a platonic relationship, not going into detail.  so, after the second serious conversation (both of these on chat, by the way), i was forced to make a decision: either to abandon our relations entirely, so i can focus on starting anew and pursuing other things rather than her (already had a girl in my sights, from the other class, shes pretty and seems nice), or continue our \"friendship\". i decided the latter.  well, i could spend a couple more sentences explaining why i did that, when i was, until that point, basically begging her not to end our thing we semi-had (yeah, she insisted on it first, even when saying she didnt want it, and was doing it for my happiness).  but, eh, i guess i had expected it, as our relationship had started to kinda go bad-ish in the last couple of weeks-days-idontevenknows.   so, yeah, i decided to end it. a couple days pass, us not talking to each other. i had started to get over it quickly, to my surprise, as, i guess, i was expecting this last conversation that we had that night for some time and i had prepared for it in advance. i dont really know why, but, no matter the reason, what matters is she texted me one night.  it was this wednesday, if you want to be specific. i was asleep during the time she sent the text, but i woke up at 1 am for some reason and saw it. she wanted to talk. i didnt really have an emotional reaction to that, didnt expect fucking anything.  so, the morning happens, schooln stuff, blablabla. i didnt really have any wish to talk to her, as i was kinda having a bad day... for the last couple of days. its hard dealing with this...\"break-up\" and having a depressing episode at the same time. maybe the latter was cause by the former, i dunno, i dont care. so, yeah, i dont talk to her during school hours. after that, i tell my friends to leave me go home for the day (i usually head for the bus stop with them, or even go on foot, going to a friends home, then heading to my sweet un), as i was kinda feeling depressed, and had myself open if she finally decided to catch up to me and talk to me.   which, of course, she did. and, whaddaya know, she tells me she loves me.   what the fuck?! - was my first reaction. it was.. what the fuck?! what the... how does.... why do.... what the fuck?!   ....fuck!   i love her. this is the best time for that snape flashback.    so, we had a little talk. we kissed, we cuddled. things are fine, you know? were together, were happy. im happy. i truly am, no sarcasm intended. i love her, it isnt a lie. so were together for these couple of days, were together now. we send eachother cute little emojis. kisses, hearts, that kind of stuff, you know? its really cute, i love it. shes a cutie. but... it feels.... it feels lackluster.   how do i express this? i dont even know how. i guess... it kinda feels like a dream come true, but... after that dream was replaced by another and let to waste. i wanted to start anew. it felt like it, you know? i had started to gather the courage to talk to that other girl ive been eyeing, before current gf comes and talks to me. i had started to be content with myself, starting to appreciate other aspects of life, as i was obsessed with this girl, texted daynnite, abandoned plans just to go out with her, that sort of thing. when we separated, i felt... kind of free. i dont know. i honestly dont.    its 3:50 right now, took me exactly 40 minutes to write down this story. excuse gramatical mistakes and stuff like that.   well, i hope you got a bit of entertainment out of that. cause this isnt the nitty gritty of the post. its just a fraction of the reason i wrote it.   3:52. right now, i have this fantasy scenario thingy. i wish to run away. you know? just to abandon all my friendships, all relationships, all family, and go out into the world alone. i love martial arts. maybe i can go to shaolin, learn a bit of kung fu or some stuff like that. why? i feel like im a fucking burden. my friends, my family, my now-gf. i feel like theyre burdened with me. with the every-other-day depressive episode. i call it a \"bad day\". decided to stray away from calling it what it is unless its really serious, but 99% of the time its fucking depression. its killing me. i got taken by the police one night, drunkie me had decided to jump off a bridge after downing a bottle of vodka after i got in a fight with nowgf. i talked to her before my planned jump. biggest meltdown of my life. whatever. other suicide attempts, people dont know about. i dont even know sometimes, what qualifies as an attempt. is it just not being careful when crossing the street, on purpose? is it punching the wall out of anger when taking a shower and/or crying? is it being a little too confident around some people, realising you could get in trouble for that fight you could cause, and the consequences can depress you so much, you can ruin your life? not everytime its literal suicide, you know? sometimes, i just wanna kill something inside me. dont even know what.   i am really sorry if this has gotten really confusing for you. lemme do a quick recap for ya:tl;dr:theres this girl. love her. after a year of self-caused torture and suicide attempts while trying to win her over, and serious conversation where she decides we should end what we have, we separate. couple days pass, we talk, she tells me she loves me. now in a relationship. i wanna die. i wanna run away. start anew. i hate myself. i hate my depression']\n",

(also, went no contact with what i thought was the love of my life. its the right move but it definitely stung. fuck last week)2am this morning my monday starts. just as aggressive as last week. my grandmother frail and wobbling, is tottering around the tile kitchen, with a dying flashlight \"getting some food\" kay........ my mom puts her angry ass to bed. we all go back to bed, sorta. 6am, shes using a dirty dish to put fruit in. mom tells her that she took a dish from the dirty side of the sink( left) rather than the clean rack (right) grandma exploded with the usual. \"i cant do anything right, all you do is yell at me, i might as well be dead i cant do anything right by you!!\" mom does what she can before work, and i tag in.i explain ( for the millionth time- and yes i know i should be more empathic for her memory, but for fucks sake im so sick of this same circular argument) that we are here to make sure youre safe and healthy. while i cant force you to exercise and get your strength back, but i can make sure youre clean and relatively safe.shes. not. having. it.(and frankly, i totally get that too, i dont even believe my own bullshit after this long)*more verbal abuse*\"you should be ashamed of yourself\"\"youre mentally beating me\"\"you need to get a job\"and finally her #1 hit... \"im going to kill myself!\"i was already aware of my burn out. i have my \"mental health toolbox\" thanks to therapy, medication and consistent introspection, and ive been ignoring it in favor of my bed and making my dogs snuggle me. full depression burrito mode, even though my list of stuff to do is just getting longer and longer, im beat.i told her last week when she did this, i would follow her down that bunny hole if she wanted to go out that way. doesnt matter to me lady. she just glared at me, while i berated myself for being the worst caregiver, and for taking the bait. i know better.the weekend i laid low. tried to reset myself again.this morning... i lost my cool. mid rant ( lots of those happening in this house today 🙄) she said it again, \"i might as well be dead!!!\"\"...ya know what? go ahead. neither of us want to be here, and quite frankly, taking a swan dive off the roof sounds like the best way to end this.\"the words were out of my mouth and so true. i scared myself. she didnt see it, she just continued with her refrain... im too bossy, she never acted this way with her mother when she was older, i should be ashamed, she doesnt want to live anymore bc there is no point.. which is fine by me, im not trying to scare my grandmother, but both our lack of value with our lives is... worrying. if she threatens again, im calling the police station, she may not take suicide threats seriously, but i sure the fuck do.jumping off things was never a method or a plan i made before. sometimes, when i would find a \"right\" high spot, the thought would hold me for a bit longer than comfortable, but i usually dismissed it. probably would hurt. but now im kinda fixated. it is a two story, a proper dive would probably do the trick... and as ive gotten older physical pain scares me less and less. id just need to fall on my head, i could manage that...but thats when i \"look\" at my toolbox and its like \"what about your mom?\" \"what about your dog?\" my bff is amazing and strong, shed be okay. probably not mom or dad though.anyway, thanks for reading this rant. depression']\n",

      "['i had finally come around to acknowledging that it was time. when i first got her she was basically my antidepressant. she kept me going when i didn’t want to get out of bed or wouldn’t eat. i took her to a vet who recommended putting her down. in my upset denial. i made an appointment with another vet, but also to put her down if he said the same thing. second opinion and all. her appointment was wednesday. i tell my boyfriend about all this. he says he will support me in whatever i do. tuesday night rolls around and we go out to a bar for a bit to let off steam and get out of the house for a bit. just knowing what i had to do the next day was sending me into ugly oprah cry a lot. he gets belligerently drunk and starts telling me that he doesn’t think it’s time for my dog. and that i just need to work harder at it because it’s what happens when dogs get older. he also said the reason why she was how she was is because she was reacting to my negative energy. so i being an emotional wreck as it was, start crying at the bar, in front of his friends and a few of mine. cue my boyfriend hysterically laughing at me for crying. at that point i pay our $30 tab and his roommate drives him back to their house as i wasn’t about to have him come to mine in that state. i needed him that night. i needed him to comfort me. and instead he chose to be a drunk, stupid, asshole. the next morning, wednesday morning, i’m up. cradling my baby, trying not to be upset in front of her because i don’t want her to get bothered that i’m upset. i’m trying to find a dog friendly patio to get her a burger for her last meal.  he starts texting. he doesn’t remember what happened. do i still want him to go with me that day. i said after last night, no. and he asked if we were over. it was all too much. i really needed him to just fuck off but he wouldn’t take no for an answer and said if i wasn’t breaking up with him, that he was coming to her stuff. so i find a puppy friendly patio. her and i head down there. he meets us and there’s not much talking going on. i am not ready to rehash the events and bullshit of the night before. my attentions and thoughts needed to be on my baby. so we go, vet says without doing expensive blood tests and such that he would guess it’s a severe cancer. she had lost about 50 pounds in 16 months, which was about half her body weight. he said her quality of life was not very good at this point. cue insufferable guilt. why had i let it get that way? i should have seen that it was time before, but i just couldn’t be without her. she was probably the only reason why i had made it through the last decade, and i just wanted her with me.  she was still so strong, would pull on her leash and what not, and was still eating and shitting like a champ. so i just kept hanging on. so i make the decision and killed my best friend. and i honestly wanted to just die along with her. cue devastation. cue all the terrible thoughts. my boyfriend spent ten mins outside the clinic holding me as i hysterically cried. and then he said he had to go back home to sleep because he works nights. and i was definitely disappointed. i felt he let me down again. so i went to my parents’ and continued to hysterically ugly oprah cry and break down. things finally calmed a little. some friends of his asked if i wanted to go out that night and since i didn’t want to go home to my empty house i once shared with her, or be alone, i went. and they asked how everything went after they had seen my boyfriend’s antics on tuesday night. i filled them in and his own friends said that i had been the only one putting in effort in a while, and that i don’t deserve the way he treats me, and that him failing me in my time of need should be the last straw. and like me holding onto her, i had probably been doing the same with him. so i decide he and i very seriously need to talk. thursday morning, after he gets off work at 9am i go to his place. i didn’t pack all his things from my house to take over because i was genuinely interested in talking to see if we could work things out. i asked him why we should be together. he said because he loves me. it’s not enough to just say it, i need to see it, and feel it. he says that he isn’t happy. he knows i’m not happy. so what else do we try to change it? he has no suggestions. just a lot of “i don’t know”.so i end things. if you can’t tell me why we should be together or what i bring to your life as your girlfriend, what’s the point?so i get my things and i go. tell him i’ll get him his things when i get a chance. he says i hope you know, i really do love you. i told him, i know he does, but i need to feel it. i need to know that in more than just words. we talk more, and i tell him i’m willing to give him a chance to win me back to show me he means what he says. and now it’s been days of back and forth. so who knows where that will be.  in the meantime i’ve been doing all i can not to be home. when i’m home the house is empty. there is no joy. when i open the door there isn’t a little nose and a wagging tail coming to love me. when i get up, i don’t need to get out of bed to let her out and feed her. when i’m sleeping there isn’t a cuddle buddy chasing rabbits in her dreams next to me. and it’s crushing me. last night i was finally able to drag her beds into my empty bedroom. i still haven’t been able to really touch her things. i haven’t been able to get past the guilt that i kept her in suffering because i selfishly didn’t want to let her go. before i had to put her down, i told him i was scared of the depression']\n",

      "['i dunno what it would be in english school system). you basically choose between 3 sections: s(science), es(economics) and l(litterature). i chose science because i cant stand economics and in litterature you dont have all the science subjects anymore which i love. the only problem is that it is a shitton of work in science section. i am an absolute asskicker in physics and biology but my grades in math just keep getting worse. the teacher is nice and all but he told me at one point that he is absolutely disappointed in me and he should give me a worse grade on my last test so i dont have the average for the trimester because i dont deserve it (each trimester you get an average grade of all the grades you got in the three months and i had 10/20 what is just the acceptable grade to get your graduation at the end). he didnt do it because he is not that much of a jerk but it still was a total dickmove to say that and it hit me quite hard. \\\\- another thing this year is a big group project for our finals. it is really long (30 pages production with our own scientific experiences and researches). the teachers expect from us that we dedicate our life to this and do nothing else. private life is nonexistant for students. and they expect that we give our first version of it to them in two weeks so they can correct and dont have to work during christmas holydays (normally the project deadline is in fucking march). they give us the thing back so we can make it better during the christmas holidays(cause, again, students are not allowed to have free time) they put so much fucking pressure on us and my group just finished 4 pages only. in addition to that, all the teachers expect full dedication to their subject too. every teacher thinks their subject is the most important.\\\\-every subject requires a shitton of work itself because the teachers give us more and more work to make us perfect in their subject having no regard for the work in other subjects and especially no regards for the fucking students because we are machines only made to work and free time is nothing to be even thought of. so i started to live of the i dont have a single fuck to give philosophy. but that just upsets my teachers as my work for their subjects gets less. im still really good at the majority of the subjects and an absolute asskicker at physics and biology. but it doesnt stop. they expect more! so im starting to collapse in the work and have some mental breakdowns from time to time.\\\\-the only teachers that realize this are the math teacher and the cinema teacher. the math teacher says he is sorry for us but we have to show them how much we can kick ass in school. we mustnt show weakness (except if it gets too serious). our cinema teacher is the coolest dude i´ve ever met. today for exemple i was alone in class with my friend and him before the class started and all the others were buying lunch at the cafeteria. he asked us if it happens that we sometimes have depressive feelings. he said he had some occasionally. i replied that with the shitton of work we have it is harder. he laughed and said damn kids these days dont have time to be depressed. my friend said as a joke that he was incorrect and it should be \"we have no time for suicide\" instead. hereplied with a laughter. he studied philosophy and we talk often during his class (occasionally about depression, suicide and the question \"if society really is as great as they say, why are suicide rates as high as they are and why does media not talk about it?\" i love class when we just talk about life. \\\\-when i get home i expect to have some time for myself but the homeworks come in. then when im finished i go downstairs to make food and prepare the table (my dad is at work, my sister is nice but lazy as fuck and my mom is currently sick) the only freetime i get is an hour a day, the weekends and when i go to bed but watch youtube or read secretly. im starting to feel really tired of this shit.\\\\- as i said my mom is currently sick. she has the flu and feels tired. so i do most of the chores. i do it without complaining but today she got pissed at me because i didnt answer the fucking door while i did my homeworks. she has the flu! she can go from the couch to the door and take the package from the mailman. but no! she plays it of as if she is returning as a veteran from the fucking ww1 trenches.i try to do my best at everything but people are never satisfied and expect more. im drowning in all the fucking work i have. im feelong depressed lately but i just threw the thought away because ist nowhere near to what i saw on this sub. i just listened to music and drew so i felt calmed. but now one of ,y two only friends in my class wants to change to economics section where the mathematics are on a fucking first grade level compared to what we have in science section. i would love to follow him but i cant stand the economics subject at our school. (5 hours a week if you wonder)on top of that comes the fact that i feel less and less capable of emotions. (the 4 to 5 hours a week i can spend with my friens during lunch break are an exception where i laugh and all) i even realised that i cant cry for some reason. we watched a schindlers list in cinematography class and i was internally really sad and tears started coming, but they always go back inside. im also terrified of talking to people i dont know well. so losing the onefirend mentionned later really hits me. that makes it hard just in general when the class you´re in wants to be a \"lets all be friends\" class. especially when the girl you think is really cute is in your class. im scared of other peoples judgement and of the possibilty to be stuck in an awkward situation during conversations so i flee them to begin with. i dont think i have a serious depression']\n",

      "['i just got back from a week-long vacation with my family. we went on a cruise ship to the bahamas. the first 4(?) days were great. we had a fantastic time and had a lot of fun together. one night i got a little too drunk and my family decided to go out and do stuff without me the next morning. i got deeply offended at this and for the remainder of the trip, i decided not to interact with them at all and spent most of the time in my cabin. normally, id just be a bit disgruntled but get over myself within minutes. but for some reason, i couldnt snap out of my funk no matter how hard i tried to. while in my cabin, i realized a pattern in my life -- when things are going good for me, i sometimes feel like i dont deserve it and get hit by a sudden wave of depression that sends me crashing back down to earth. this has happened to me consistently throughout the years and i realized it this weekend for the first time.does anyone else experience this? any time im consistently in a good state of mind or having fun, a wave of depression']\n",

      "['i just started college recently and the shock of leaving all my friends and having to start all over again completely fucked me up. i have never been more anxious and afraid my entire life. few weeks go by and im drinking like a goddamn sailor every thursday-sunday. it’s nice because my anxiety drops while drinking (obviously) but it doubles the next day. then after a little while i notice i have a lack of motivation for just about everything in my life. i find myself grasping at old triumphs and happy times of the past and it’s reassuring in the moment but counter intuitive because i cant just “go back.” at this point i feel stuck. everyday is just constant hell and i fake my way through it pretending to be alright so i don’t scare off all these new people i want to be friends with. luckily, im a damn good actor and nobody can definitively tell. a few more weeks go by and i decide to get psychiatric help since it’s free at my school (at least the therapy part is, not the drugs). i start seeing a therapist once a week and im prescribed anti-anxiety and anti-depressant pills. when i say these are a god-send im not putting that lightly. when i told my mom i was doing this she said she hadn’t heard me that ecstatic in over a month and a half. they don’t work right away but the sheer comfort of having them in my possession immediately relieved symptoms. now i’m about a month and a half in to taking these drugs and they still are doing wonders, but they are not without issue. i stopped taking the anti-anxiety meds because they were prescribed on an as needed basis and my college anxiety dropped significantly so they just frankly weren’t necessary at a certain point. so this is a 100% focus on the anti-depressants, specifically fluoxetine with a 25mg dose. ive started to notice that my general emotional state doesn’t feel entirely myself. it’s like someone is pulling my strings like a puppet to make me smile. it’s great sometimes because i probably wouldn’t feel good otherwise but it’s robbed me of the ability to fully feel negative emotions. do i prefer it to the depression? of course. but i guess the issue is more of my lack of understanding of the drug prior to usage. i thought that it would make me “feel normal.” it gets damn well close but it’s phony and i know it is. i desperately want to ween myself off the drugs but i fear i may be developing a dependency and im worried about the me that lives on the other side of my happy pills.also there’s 1 more side effect that is super shitty. climaxing is a bitch now, an absolute bitch. it’s nearly impossible and will probably take an hour. i literally get to the point where i tire out my partners and i feel kind of embarassed. then they get self-conscious because they think they’re not turning me on enough. it’s a whole thing and goddamn is it frustrating. i have to tell them usually that im on anti-depressants and i hate telling people im depressed']\n",

      "['i did community college for 2 years and my major was not offered there. anyways i was pursuing a double degree in earth and planetary science and math and things started to look up for me and loved how everyone seemed proud of me and my struggling times are finally behind me. before i get to my story, i have had an anxiety disorder my senior year of high school and 3 years of college. went away when i got a job with a cameraman for the school and local sports back in 2014. i also don’t have many friends and have been single most of my life. so back to the storyone of my dreams as a kid grow in up was to study weather. i’ve always wanted to be a weather man. and i just loved weather in general being a kid and growing up. i wanted to go to a school that taught those classes and hope to make it! unfortunately due to not doing so well in high school and where i live, that option was not available in my state, so i ended up going to a community college due to poor grades and since it was cheaper. after a year and a half i transferred over to the university here and found out meteorology wasn’t available, so i did the next closest thing which was earth and planetary science. it’s mostly geology but i dislike geology very much. a bit disappointed but as someone with a family that struggles financially, i had to settle here. life was tough in my early college years, i set my bar high to pass my classes but i always ended up with c’s and maybe a class i didn’t pass, which is why i took longer. having horrible anxiety being in class made it difficult to learn. but i marched on. whenever i didn’t pass a class, i tried again next semester and end up passing it. my gpa was always around 2.5 the whole way through, so i’m what you call a below average joe, everyone in my field has above a 3.0 except for me. although when i got a job and started interacting with more people and working in another department (communications) i built confidence and my anxiety slowly faded which allowed me to focus better in class, i saw my grades improving and i’ve noticed i’m doing well in calculus so i decided to add a math minor to go along with my degree. along with my confidence building, last year i had the guts to ask my friend out and she said yes and she became my girlfriend and life was continuing looking upward, no depression, and life was good. to continue on with the life looking upward, i decided to add math as my major so that put me to pursuing two degrees and i felt great! i knew what i wanted, i knew what i wanted to achieve in life, i saw my path clear as day, i had this in the bag!my school finally offered a meteorology class in the spring 2018 semester and was taught by a professor who used to work at the national weather service. i continuously began talking to her throughout class and definitely showed my interest and performed to the best of my ability in class. got a b+ but her class was generally on the more difficult side. since i did show a lot of effort she even offered me a visit to the national weather service in june. truly a dream come true, i was at a loss for words! i spoke with everyone there, got a tour of the place, they showed me how the instrumentations worked and i was even offered a volunteer opportunity with them. all i had to do was fill out the application and follow normal procedures. in june, i also got a new job as a supervisor and to me it paid better than the camera man job but i still do both. i was going to start saving up so i can move out of my parents place and start life, apply to grad school so i can earn my masters as well. then, the new job started a bit too fast paced and it was difficult to keep up at some point, but that’s okay, a new job can always be a hassle. but it did put me in some stress but i didn’t mind, the pay was nice and couldn’t complain at all. i was taking summer school but i understood the material. i ended up passing my class with a b which allowed me to get my eps degree, though still working on the math. and i finally submitted my application to the national weather service.they did say it’ll take a few days for the application viewing, so about that time i submitted it i started school, and being confident in my math skills i signed up for 4 math classes and because of the school financial aid, i can’t fall below less than 2.0 and pass all of my classes with a c or better. i felt prepared since i was doing so well, and i had to graduate by spring 2019.first week of class i fell behind and struggled dearly to where i can still drop a class without it being in my grades. i started to study and study and i couldn’t learn the material, like i hit a learning wall. i couldn’t learn new stuff anymore.       i got so frustrated with the homework i didn’t do it, i even went to get help from the professor and i just couldn’t learn it from them. what led up to not doing homework ended up to just not going to class. i went to my advisor to downgrade my math major back to a minor so no matter the outcome of the semester i can graduate this fall. i then found out i need just 1 more math class to get the minor. but i’m struggling hard in every class that i just can’t do it. to make this story bad, i never heard back from the national weather service. i feel like my application got denied and with the failing semester and poor grades, i won’t get into graduate school, i was going to study meteorology with it since it’s not offered here. it’s like my life fell apart in a short month. i feel like i lost everything and i can’t pick myself back up anymore. i can’t push through this final semester, i’m down and out for the count. it’s like everyone was proud of me for what i’ve been doing, everyone was happy for me, i’ve let everyone down. ive let my girlfriend down since she’s been helping me but i’ve been pushing her away. she’s telling me to seek help and it’s so difficult to reach out. i’m losing everyone around me. i’m losing everything. i’ve lost my dream and i feel like i don’t have a future anymore. i’m trying to attempt my hw and going to class but i just don’t want to do it or go to class anymore.i don’t know what i want anymore, i don’t know if this is the right place to talk about this but i just need someone to listen to me. tl;dr: what seemed like a clear path in my life with my earth and planetary science and mathematics degree, getting a volunteer opportunity with my dream job, the national weather service, and hoping to go to grad school and getting my masters in meteorology, turned out to be crushing as i cant learn anymore, i won’t get the math degree, or even the minor, never heard back from the national weather service, i won’t even get into grad school, i have no future at all anymore. and it’s making me depressed']\n",

      "['i had a heart of stone. there was no warmth in my heart. no one in this world would ever accept me. no one would ever want to be my friend. i wasnt capable of feeling love or emotion toward other people. the only person who was selfless enough to deal with my heart of ice was her, my mother. i cant tell you how many times i heard that lecture when i was 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years old.i dont love my parents. i simply tolerate them. i dont love my siblings. i tolerate them as well. im not even sure if im capable of actually being in a fulfilling, loving relationship because the last 3 or 4 times i tried, everything crashed and burned. ive finally checked myself into therapy and got diagnosed with a bunch of conditions though, so thats a start.anyway, im curious as to whether i can truly say that i loved someone. itd be nice to know that perhaps my mother was incorrect--that i can love someone.way back around the time when the world was about to end (2012), i was super infatuated with someone. obviously, there was a honeymoon period, and then things got shittier after the puppy love wore off and it became embarrassingly obvious that i had no idea how to sustain a healthy relationship. its not as if having my mother molest me and spectating my parents verbally and physically abuse each other for 18 years helped either, but thats beside the point.so she dumps me in 2014, fine. i didnt ask for a second chance. i didnt beg. i was torn, but i just asked if she had been feeling this way for a while. indeed she had been feeling like dumping me for a while but chose to wait until after my college finals were over. i thanked her and ran off to cry somewhere.for the first few months after the breakup, i did the same immature shit that a lot of guys do. which is try to guilt-trip her. i told her that i had taken up smoking hookah, implying that i needed to engage in dumb activities to get over her. yeah, that was pretty fucked up, as she was naturally concerned about my health.after some soul-searching, i decided to just block her on facebook in 2015. i had posted a picture of me all bloodied and bruised with 50% of my right cheek missing after a nasty bike accident. she hadnt seen it yet, and i didnt want her to see it. i knew it wouldnt be right for her to see it. i blocked her for like a year or so.then i unblock her in 2016 and casually message her for a bit, just making some small talk. when she didnt see my last message until ~2 months after i sent it, i left the conversation at that. i figured that she didnt want to talk. i wasnt going to just keep on pestering her.i didnt talk to her for 2.5 years. i figured it would be only right to give her the space she had wanted. i stopped completely with the guilt-tripping bullshit. i didnt post dumb shit on facebook in the hope that shed see it and react a certain way. i grew past that bullshit. i was set on never talking to her again in this life. i knew it was the right thing to do. if she wanted to talk, she would reach out. my inbox is always open. i knew there was something wrong with me at that point and i didnt want to just keep shoving my issues onto her.in 2018, i finally checked myself into therapy. i knew there had been something wrong with me. i wanted to become a better person. i got my diagnoses and started therapy. when i got diagnosed, my first question was how long would treatment take. the doctor told me probably 18-36 months. i started thinking--what if i complete therapy? could i then free myself of this self-imposed exile of not talking to her? what if i reach out in 2021? 2022? i could make a good faith effort to reach out again after i had completed treatment, right?? i knew i couldnt repeat the same mistakes i committed before.i decided to reach out to her before 2021, but only after consulting with my girlfriends and r/askwomenadvice. i had already completed some therapy, and i felt that i could probably make a good faith effort to reach out and ask for a second chance. i asked politely if she wanted to catch up, and perhaps even go on a date after she was comfortable, but she politely declined. i respected her decision, and wished her a merry christmas and a happy 2019. i left the conversation at that, and i dont plan on ever returning to it. i felt overjoyed, even if the answer wasnt quite what i wanted to hear. i had finally gotten the closure i needed.i could move on with my life instead of wondering \"when the fuck will i get better enough to reach out to her??\" in 2016, my answer to \"when will i get better to reach out to her\" was a resounding \"never, youre fucked in the head, brah, leave her out of your pathetic and miserable life lol\" in 2018, after getting my diagnoses, my answer was \"maybe after you finish the 18-36 months of therapy.\" after asking around, my answer became \"reach out to her now since youve completed some therapy, and get ready to accept whatever answer comes your way.\"i never felt so genuinely happy to hear from her after 2.5 years of radio silence. even though the answer was \"no, im not interested in you on any level,\" i was overjoyed. i needed that to \"hear\" her voice again. and i needed that closure. i could finally close that chapter of my life and move on with my life without wondering \"what if...she misses me?\" i sincerely wished her well and left the conversation at that. the conversation will probably stay at that for the rest of our lives, and im okay with that. i want her to be happy, even if that doesnt involve me. i knew i had blown my chance way back in 2014, and i wasnt going to beg her for a chance. ask politely once, yes, but beg? i never begged before, and i wasnt about to start. i wasnt going to guilt-trip her either with some bullshit like \"i need you in my life, you are my oxygen, im going to be depressed']\n",

(i have never gone outside of the northern countries for a vacation, so this is the first time in my life that i got to see an exotic place)  absolutely amazing job, met a lot of new friends, also met my current girlfriend.i lost both of my grandmothers to old age and a friend who was found dead in the woods outside of my old city. i never got to be on either of their funerals, neither did i meet or talk to them for a long time prior to their deaths.  ive had some episodes of depression, which, luckily for me, i had my friends and my girlfriend to cheer me up.   but these feelings got out of hand one day after a fight with my girlfriend, whereas i tried ending my life by some pills. i cant recall these pills, but they didnt work. i woke up at the hospital, then they put me in mental care for 3 days. got back to the hotel where i worked, got fired. basically my boss ended my contract, so i wasnt actually fired per-say. but still fired. i came home to sweden, sought up a psychiatrist, talked for 2 months.im still together with my girlfriend, but she lives in another country, so we cant meet as often as wed like. this causes us to doubt in our relationship due to this long distance.  2 days ago my little brother hanged himself, and no one notified me about this. i discovered it by myself from my stepmoms facebook page. aaaaand, i missed the funeral.  i will also be spending this christmas alone, with the only person i cherish and care for 1000km away from me.  this year ive lost 3 relatives and a friend. gained loads of friend and a bestfriend/lover.  am i still depressed']\n",

(care).but later on after bunch of other sessions with her... she mentioned that the day i told her that i thought she was depressed, it hit her mind when she went home after finishing her job \"she thought about it\".which means she cared about a thought! shes just covering up how she conceives herself... as a defense mechanism. for the sake of her own mental health.which means shes the type of person whose thoughts have major inputs on their own feelings. \"theres care\"...when youre depressed and act happy... eventually youll blow off and break down.

      "['i remember being depressed at the early age of 10. there wasn’t a bunch of terrible things that happened to me but i was always pessimistic. i would sit down by the benches when we would have a field day outside while everyone played volleyball or ran outside in middle school. i remember running to the gym locker rooms when i didn’t want to participate in gym class anymore.  i remember not going to parties and telling my friends that i wanted to end my life. that’s how serious it was at the time.  i cant stop thinking about my job of two years that i left in the winter time. i stayed there as long as i did because it was convenient to get to  and my school schedule fit well with the job. the work was pretty easy. i feel like the more that i talk about it the more i get mad again over situations that i had been in but at the same time i need to talk about it to the people who are trying to help me get better because they will know the root of my depression. there had been an investigation for three months before i left in december 20th. a supervisor went around to my coworkers for one on ones where she would ask us questions like how long have you been here, how do you like working here and what kind of suggestions do you have for our menu. by the time that i actually got to talk to her she has talked to everyone in my store and this made me sad because i did not feel apart of the team. for whatever meeting that we had i was always the last one and this made me feel unimportant. i always had to ask when my meeting would be and be on top of the people who i was supposed to have meetings with whether it be for a performance review or a meeting for an interview. i caught the person who was supposed to have my meeting with on a day that i wasnt scheduled to work, i had been filling in for someone during that day. i had been trying to get ahold of her for weeks and was pretty disappointed that she had neglected to meet with me until i stepped in on 12/20 when she tried running out of the store.  when  my district manager finally asked me how do i like working here i lost it. i told her that i was miserable because there was drama everyday. she had asked me who is creating all of this drama and i said that i didnt know because it seemed like everyone had their own share in creating drama. she mentioned that she has no tolerance for drama.  i mentioned two coworkers that have been doing nothing but flirting making everyone else pick up the slack for them. this was pretty irritating. we had talked to them several times about how they werent doing anything but nothing ever changed. one day i just told me general manager that i could no longer work with them. i had suggested that i not work a certain day that they were working and that i start coming in earlier on my other days that they were not working in order to make up for the loss hours. my general manager dismissed my concerns for other coworkers and lied to me saying that she could no grant my wish because she was understaffed when in fact she wasnt understaffed. why she did not say we should all have a meeting together to discuss my concerns i dont know. i brought this up during my one on one with my supervisor. my general manager was later asked about whether or not this conversation really happened and she denied that we spoke about it. it was then when i went from miserable to pissed off. i brought this up with my supervisor and she got pretty mad that i did not talk to my general manager after she denied that i talked to her about not closing with several of my coworkers. my supervisor told me that i make everything so complicated and proceeded to lecture me on what three things i need to do in order to be successful working there. she quizzed me on what the three things were and me not being in my state of mind did not answer correctly. i believe that she used this quiz to take the pressure off of her and throw me off. after i got her question wrong she then transitioned to asking me what my schedule was. i was on winter break so i gave her my winter break schedule and then she asked what was my school schedule. she later told me that something would happen next week before i worked next. i did not make it to my next working day. i met with her a second time, this time at a coffee shop after i had begged her for a second meeting. i lost it that christmas day.  i did not hear back from her after getting my phone called forwarded and after leaving a voicemail early in the morning. i stayed up late talking to one of my managers about my supervisors lack of response. my supervisor had texted me at 5pm asking me if everything was okay but that was the last i heard of her that day. i texted her at 10pm pleading her to please answer. since my first meeting with her i was immediately sick to my stomach, not able to sleep, eat, or function throughout the day. i had discussed problems with the store that had been bothering me since i first started working there. i did not speak about it until i had the platform because i was scared of retaliation from my general manager. my general manager had a history of doing people dirty who did not follow her way, often removing people from the schedule completely without notifying the person she took off.what went on in the second meeting that i had with my supervisor i cant remember completely, but even if i did remember most of it, it is too long to write about.  i first got there and i bring a water bottle and she asks me if i paid for it and i told her yes. she continued to ask me if i bought it because she did not see me walking in, just me grabbing  a water bottle. she told me that she would pay for it but i again told her that i had already paid. i bought the water because i am not a big coffee person. she was on her computer at the time that i walked in. as soon as i sat down she had told me that i worried her the night before when i begged her to pick up the phone. she had told me that she didnt know what to do because i mentioned her that i couldnt work with three people in the store, one of them including my general manager. i suggested that she should transfer my general manager but my supervisor was pretty firm on keeping her no matter what i said. by the last time that she told me that she didnt know what to do i threw my hands up in the air and said i dont know what to say either. before i could finish my sentence she has asked me if i wanted to take a month off. she did not give me any explanation for this but i took on her offer because i was desperate to get out at the time and i took it without any hesitation. she asked me if i wanted to take february off and i told her that i preferred to take january off because i am already taking time off because of a trip that i had planned out in advance. these last couple of meetings left me completely broken. even though my supervisor did not talk much or say anything wrong i did not come back the same after these two meetings and i am still broken almost a year afterwards. i think about it all the time. multiple therapists, family members and friends have warned me to never go back but the peacemaker in me wants to go back and make everyone happy. at this job,  i didnt have anybody yelling at me all the time like i did with all of my jobs after this smoothie place. with all of the jobs that i have had since then i have been getting yelled at a lot and it damages my self-esteem and ultimately triggers my depression. im sick of getting yelled at all of the time. i liked this smoothie job so much because it was convenient for me. it was convenient for me to get there, it was easy money, and i was comfortable there. i am no longer there because the place was full of drama with everyone fighting each other and it really affected my mental health eventually causing me to have a full mental breakdown. it wasnt until i had one conversation with my supervisor where all of my problems with the store came out from a place that i had stored in a far away place. since my conversation with this supervisor i have been super depressed']\n",

      "['i can name maybe three or four times ive been really happy in that time and every one of them was followed by a huge crash maybe a few days later at the latest. for years i ignored it.about three years ago i finally understood i was depressed. i went to a new college and got tons of oppurtunities... and my life didnt change. i still get horrible, i had no friends, i hated being in public, i hated being alone and it felt actually painful. the only person i could talk to would constantly abandon me, and later went on to abuse me. after a few months things really crashed to that level and i felt absolutely crazy, obsessed with a girl i had managed to win over then canceled a date with when she showed some reluctance. i didnt bother her but started to think about her constantly like she was the only hope i could imagine in the darkness. i thought it was rock bottom, but i had no idea how much i would now love to go back there, how much fucking worse things have gotten. the following year i started fighting the worsening depression with endless masturbation. just drowning my brain in whatever chemicals it pumps out. surrounded by groups of people who are all having fun while im picking up dinner alone? go back to my room and masturbate. miss class because i stayed up until 5am thinking about suicide and crying? masturbate for hours and skip he next class too. and on and on. it became my primary means of filling my time, or mental stimulation, of making time pass, etc. i became addicted really early on but didnt even notice because i didnt think of stopping or slowing down (something i couldnt have done if i tried). the real problem emerged as i started looking at the most fucked up shit i could. i needed something mentally stimulating to replace friends, plans, and relationships, and something that i could still feel in the depression. so i started to look at porn that would sexualize my fears, inadequacy, depression, abuse, and pain. i looked at porn about cheating, which turned into porn about cuckolding, which turned into porn about lies about sex and women and straight up brainwashing, then into the most bizarre and extreme and racist stuff. i built up dozens of triggers and fucked up subjects i would trawl the web for, and my non existent willpower and lack of a life meant this was hours everyday filling my head with the most fucked up stuff and brainwashing myself and destroying my sexuality. i tried to contact a sex therapist and talk to people on reddit, asking for help, how to undo what i did and get this incredibly hurtful stuff or of my head. i never want to be with someone who would sleep with someone else and i hate feeling inadequate or having my head messed with. but no one believed me, they thought i was out of touch with my sexuality. they wouldnt listen when i told them about how i was gaslit by someone who wanted me to let them sleep with other people. or when i told them that it was hurting me and i didnt want it anymore. i wasnt consenting to whatever part of my brain was dragging me to fill some fetish for the feeling of my brain coming apart at the seems.at this point im out of school and everything is in shambles. my grades were awful, i have no resume or connections, no friends. let my body go completely and i hate it and my indequate genitals. everyday is the same, completely pointless and just me trying to distract myself so that i dont lose control and masturbate to things that make me lose the will to live. its usually just when i feel depressed which is unfortunately nearly every time im alone for more than a few moments.i feel completely out of touch with the world, i am terrified of people. i feel like even if i found someone they would either abuse me, brainwash me into letting them fuck other people, or be taken away by someone better. its such a bizarre problem, no one even wants to help me, just give me a lecture on sex positivity, i the talking about it because it just makes me feel even more hopeless, and my brain feels permenantly miswired and my body and mind completely inadequate. every time i see an article about someone cheating or how monogamy is a lie i want to slit my wrists.and underneath all of that im still depressed']\n",

      "['i have hope, you should too.i relate to everyone on this subreddit so much. i used to come here daily, read the posts, comment sometimes. it was a place of understanding, compassion. everyone knows what it is like to be depressed. but often it is not the most positive place, which sometimes can be destructive. regardless i wanted to come here and share my story, and maybe shine some hope onto those who might read this. i was raised by a mother with borderline personality disorder, and another mother with severe anxiety. my sister was a premature baby, 1lbs 15oz, she had a 10% chance of living. shes 25 now, 100% healthy and normal functioning human being. she lived the first year of her life in the hospital. all of these things primed for a very dysfunctional household. i came in 5 years later. my sister was the favourite child, and my parents did everything for her. if you know anything about borderline, then you know exactly what its like to grow up with a mother with it. (r/raisedbyborderlines for the best info on the web) basically borderline is similar to narcissism. they like to manipulate and control the people close to them. they will do anything to make sure everyone validates their own feelings. they are typically helicopter parents because they need to control every aspect of their childrens lives. you can read more about them at raisedbyborderlines!so my childhood sucked basically. anxiety, depression, self-image issues, all of these are extremely common of children raised by borderlines. guess what ive got them all. my family was pretty low income too. so money was always tight. until i was 15 and worked at a summer camp and made some friends, i had basically been brainwashed by my mother. i realized all the things i was deprived of. friends, parties, any kind of mature content. i became rebellious, i lied constantly to get away from home. i did things i wasnt supposed to. things at home started to go bad quickly. i was lectured and scolded, i was put-down and belittled. i was emotionally abused. when i was 16 decided i had adhd. i went to my family doctor and filled out the forms, was ready to get my new medication. instead of adhd, they told me i had depression. i was a naive little kid, so i went with it. i started taking the pills, things at home got worse. i cycled between different medications every 3-4 months as nothing seemed to be working. i started to drink alcohol way more. id lie and say i was going to an approved friends house, but instead, go to a different house and get drunk. i was lectured more and more, told i was worthless. grounded. refused permission to go to reasonable places overnight. i lied more and more. i needed to escape home. i couldnt take the abuse. i went to this party just after i started taking antidepressants, drank two whole pints, smoked a few bowls, while my meds amped the effects twofold. i blacked out completely and got lost in the woods. friends searched for hours for me. i showed up after like 4 hours covered in cuts and dirt. i remember nothing from that night. scariest experience of my life. well, obviously things got worse at home. i started smoking weed every weekend with my pals over the winter. lets fast forward a year. im 18 and im in my first semester at university hours away from home. great things should be great, i dont have to deal with my family. im free to do whatever i want. i made the football team there too. i thought things were gonna be great. boy was i wrong. i had trouble making friends (fuck you anxiety) i didnt do well in school. my depression was starting to peak. i stopped going to class. i smoked weed in my room every day. i slept like 16 hours a day. i started branding my forearm with a hot lighter. i was so deep in the hole i felt like there was no exit. jump to christmas break. ugh, i had to be with my family again. as to be expected my family was unbearable. they didnt see i was suffering so much. i had enough. they broke me. i tried to kill myself just days before christmas. i was ready to die, i wanted it to be all over. i woke up in the hospital the next day. in hindsight taking 60 sleeping pills wasnt the most effective way to kill myself. my mother got mad at me for killing myself. she talked about how hurtful it was that i would do that to her. nothing was any better at home. my cry for help failed but i had been given another chance at life. i transferred schools for the second semester. i got into a room with one of my best friends who was in the same program. i was down the hall from two of my other best friends. but i left football. football is my passion. transferring schools is the biggest regret in my life. i would have been able to play football if i stayed at the first school, but i probably would have failed out and tried to kill myself again if i stayed. but then again i dont know. maybe that wouldnt have happened. things started going uphill. i was with my friends, i was doing okay in school. i was away from home still. but bad news, during exams i developed severe insomnia. there goes my days of sleeping to avoid the depression. i was up for 22 hours of the day im average. i was going insane. i had a few mental breakdowns. i failed 3 of my classes. back into the pit we go. the summer wasnt much better. i tried to stay away from home as much as possible. smoked so much weed. slept in my car. slept on couches. went to a stupid fucking delivery job. spent all my money on food and weed. i was reaching a new low. i kept myself from self-harming though, i have proudly been self-harm free for almost a year. i still bear the scars, but they help to remind me that i cant return to that place i was once in. now we are in the present day. i pushed for an adhd diagnosis from my psychiatrist, which i got. i stopped taking antidepressants. i had initially wanted it all along but my incompetent family doctor was too stupid to see the signs. getting that diagnoses changed my life. i got that needed kick-start yo my day. in no way is my depression gone, my lord its here every day. but i have taken control of it. i have my days, i still struggle to go to class, i still lay in bed all day sometimes. but now i have good days. im making progress. i havent talked to my family in months. im renting my own place after this school year is over. my girlfriend has been so supportive. im still depressed. i still have insomnia. i still have anxiety. i still was abused as a child. i still wanna die sometimes. all of these things are still here. but i intend to kick their fucking asses eventually. when i woke up in the hospital room that day, something in me changed. i dont know what it was really. i guess the point of this huge essay is that there is hope. and i wanted to share some of my own. i see people talking about wanting to die. that death would be such a relief. and all the different variations of that. i agree. if i was dead i probably would be happy. i wouldnt have to deal with any of this. i wouldnt have to be in pain anymore. but choosing to die should not be what you really want. im giving depression']\n",

(i tried to hide it. always said i was going to a friends house or something just to avoid being home, while i just sad in my car at some empty parking lot). i think some of you know how it is. i tried committing suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills but i ended up throwing them up.finally i found a psychologist. he was a cool dude, and he somehow understood me. over the course of 5 months i wasn’t feeling better, but i finally opened up to some of my friends about it (it was very hard, because i hadn’t talked to them for a while). my psychologist was so happy about it and i didn’t understand why. but then it suddenly hit me. i was actually feeling better, and i had some friend who understood my behavior and they still loved me.right now i am traveling the world with my best friend. as i am writing this, i am enjoying a view of one of new zealand’s beautiful waterfalls. this is 2 years after i got my depression']\n",

      "['my life. since i developed binge eating disorder i have spent the past two years and three months doing absolutely nothing with my time but chronically masturbating, binge eating all day long (i have no limit in how much i can eat. i eat too the point of excruciating pain and feel like i’m going to pass out, and i keep eating well after that. during my bingeing lifestyle i eat nearly every hour of the day most days, and the only time i am not eating is while masturbating (sometimes while even doing that) or sleeping with lots of sleeping pills). it really hurts but i have not been able to stop as food has been the only thing to comfort my severe depression, loneliness, and anxiety, and after all the isolation from having no social life, and using food to cope with that for so long, i’ve truly become addicted to eating this way, and i have excruciating shame for myself and every day of the past. i am traumatized and it seems like all of this that i have been through haunts me every day now. i started a new school sophomore year when my bingeing problem first started. in the sixth grade i developed anorexia after a very hard move, and was forced into years recovery until freshman year by my parents...it wasn’t a bad thing though, the treatment i had gone through really did help me overcome anorexia and ocd back then. though, it didn’t resolve my social anxiety that left me as a social outcast in school, which eventually made me decide to give homeschooling a try as i was so lonely everyday at school and just had a rep for being the quiet fashionable kid (not joking i was actually picked best dressed at my eighth grade dance which was pretty cool). i tried to make friends, i really did, but i was just such a shy, social anxious kid. i was used to not have any friends at that point though so it began to not really bother me and it just felt like the norm. so, i started high school online. this ended up being a big mistake. it was fine at first because like i said i was used to not having many friends so though i had high social anxiety i was used to spending much time alone. but eventually it just caught up to me. i gained heaps of weight as i was eating more and my acne also got really bad (bad enough to go on accutane) and my self esteem hit rock bottom. i felt like a disgusting creature worthy of no guy’s love, and i worried that i would grow old alone and never get married (sorry if this sounds so dramatic but it felt this bad. since i had no friends ever throughout all these years, i just “knew” that there had to be something wrong with me and a reason why i couldn’t attract anyone). so i eventually started spending lots of time in bed, sleeping, not eating, and not doing any of my online schoolwork. i lost a lot of weight again due to not eating caused of this depression and low self esteem, which later resulted in me being hospitalized over the summer for heart problems and other symptoms from my low weight. during this depression, i attempted suicide twice just a month apart from each other. the second time was so severe as i don’t remember anything after i passed out and was only told what happened once i eventually awoke in the hospital days later.okay, so sophomore year started and i was going to be starting at a new school in a different town. i knew homeschooling was lonely and i knew i couldn’t go back to it. i honestly met some nice people in the short time i was there and the school was great. i still had a lot of social anxiety, but i’m sure if i had joined some clubs and gotten out of my comfort zone to interact with peers, things could have been great. there was even a great counselor at the school that really wanted to help me. but a new problem came that continues to haunt me to this day. binge eating.i began uncontrollably stuffing myself with food because i was so hungry. i didn’t originally do it because of depression']\n",

(for reference, i am now 22 years old.). this means there is always an uncomfortable aura in the house which means i can never fully unwind. i share a room with my brother and mother. the room was never meant to house more than one person and an extension, aka \"work room\" was built on to the bedroom which is what my brother and i share. i also have a grandfather who lives in vegas and hes been wanting me to live up there with him but i need to make money first, and i cant hold a job.**hobbies**: growing up, video games, listening to music, and reading books were my favorite things to do. overtime, ive lost interest in books though and i waste a lot of time on reddit these days. i also golfed from a very young age to about 17. i never liked it, i just did it because i thought my mom wanted me to do it. ive also had many random passing thoughts go by but never act on them. for example: archery, playing guitar/drums, making youtube videos, writing things, running and hiking are a few. ***jobs:*****counter/cook** - first job. held for 2 years. age 18-20. i was generally a good worker and dependable but occasionally i would show up a few minutes late. i had a good thing going at this particular restaurant and management liked me, but i quit. this was around the time i failed college. i even was rehired for a few weeks by the same manager before i impulsively quit again.**busser**-didnt get past the online orientation because i thought it was needlessly complicated, so i walked out.**cashier** (gas station)- made it past orientation but didnt show up for shifts.**cashier** (grocery store)-i made it one day, then stopped showing up.**movie theater**-got hired and didnt show up because my body wouldnt move out of the car. **movie theater (different location, current. age 22.) - finished my first shift yesterday and my brain really wants me to fall back to familiar habits and go no show again.***medical*****therapist** - started seeing one around age 19. i thought she wasnt helping me by just talking general stuff. so i cut off contact.**psychiatrist** - started seeing one age 21. depression']\n",

i found a girl at my work that was worthwhile, someone i could literally see myself with. have you heard the saying, if your patient the right girl will come to you...well, she was the one for me, the girl ive waited and looked for so long. she literally had every quality i wanted from a girl, sincerely nice, outgoing and fun. i changed so much for her. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people and i went back to finish college and even got my first real career job as a software developer just to prove to her im not a loser. in someways, it helped made me become the cool, confident person i always wanted to be and envisioned myself to be when i became 21. basically, i felt like i was at my prime and i thought that everything was going into place, this was the fantasy moment i always envisioned.she took notice of my change from that quiet shy guy to the new person i am now, and me and her got close for the past few months. we never kissed or held hands but i definitely felt some small spark and unlike other guys shes been with, she didnt mind the occasional kiss on the cheeks here and there. she is touched with the things i do for her and we would spend hours together after work. i would help her with work off the clock, comfort her when she was down and do just anything to make her happy.... she would drag me everywhere and she says my name in a certain way that just makes my heart melt. she was the first girl i ever felt being fully comfortable being just myself around. i thought this was a sign.... i just needed that one break, that one chance to prove to her that i am an awesome person that wont hurt her like her ex did to her.....i never got a real chance, i was shot down even before i could ask her out on a date...a real date with just me and her and not a group thing with her friends....she told me she did have some feelings for me, but she said shes afraid it would never workout. she said she doesnt want to lose me if it never works out....she was sincere about that but i knew the other big real reason. she is still hung up on her ex. she always told me she was over him but when a girl says shes 99% over with her ex, you know she is totally not. the ex works right next door and would always come over to her and try to patch things up with her. she never gave me a real chance because she still loves him....and im left in the dust, heartbroken, a \"friend\" in her eyes and at best a plan \"b\".....i dont talk to her as much anymore as i just wanted my feelings to die at this point....talking to her would just bring those feelings back...and i dont want to go back....the pain was already too much the first time...i became so fucking depressed. this wasnt the first time this happened to me, ive had girls do this to me before, but i didnt take it too seriously cause i wasnt really very close to those girls. but i felt so sure about this one....it was the closest ive ever been to a girl and the closest ive ever been to getting a girlfriend and for the first time ever, i truly felt the \"spark\" i always hear about from relationships. it hurts even more that despite my brain saying to just move on, my fucking heart keeps on trying to find any excuse to try again. i feel awkward now because sometimes the new coworkers comment on how i am. some are flattering, like they say how im pretty cute but others say i look like a fuckboy or a chad. its just a reminder of how much i changed. they judge my appearance and demeanor and thought i be the type to have a girlfriend but really i am a socially awkward loveless loser...and them saying that only makes me feel so fucking fake...of how much i changed for someone that never truly had the same feelings back...one things for sure, i dont think i can open up to another girl anymore....atleast for a while....now its just wallowing in my sorrow of being so alone in this fucking world....i just want one fucking chance....why is it so fucking hard to give a guy a chance....&#x200b;tl:dr;  i never had a girlfriend. every rejection pushed me to better myself in someway. recently met the girl of my dream. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people. she was interested in me and i was in love with her, but she wouldnt let go of her ex. then she rejected me and said she liked me as a \"friend\".....biggest heartbreak ever. now, im depressed']\n",

      "['my life, ive only succeeded in having another girl just reject my feelings towards her. this makes me feel like trash because this wasnt the first time it happened. ever since middle school, every girl that rejected me had always something about me that they didnt like and me being so insecure about myself thought that perhaps if i change myself into a better person, maybe i could get someone to finally accept my feelings back.i changed so much for these girls. i changed how i looked, how i dressed, how i acted, became more fit, confident, humorous, good-looking, heck i fucking even got better grades in my school and continued my education in college just to show off i am not a loser....as if i am like competing for being an eligible bachelor in those cheesy sitcoms. nobody wouldve recognized the disgusting, nervous wreck of a person i was before into the confident guy i am now.&#x200b;heres a picture of me on the left with the stripe shirt:[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/d/d0/1252512511.png/revision/latest?cb=20181001021806](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/d/d0/1252512511.png/revision/latest?cb=20181001021806)&#x200b;yet even when i changed so much, even when i felt like i was at my prime and at the tender age of 21, i still fucking failed! this latest girl was soooo different from all the other girls ive met. i truly felt like she was going to be the one, the girl that would be my very first love. but i was an idiot. i guess the last flaw i never was able to get fixed was figuring out if a girl liked me or not. i waited too long and didnt show my affection and now her feelings towards me had vanished. i realized my mistake the moment she said these words...\"just be yourself ramon, you dont have to be anyone else to impress me\"......no girl has ever said such a thing to me, and when i heard it from her, thats when i instantly fell in love wit her. i realized my mistake and tired desperately to rekindle that feeling but i couldnt get her to have the same spark she had before. she said in her own say that she has still embers of feeling towards me, but that she didnt believe it would last long if me and her got together. from what conversations we had for each other, it seemed to me shed rather keep me as a friend then to lose me as a person.....she was a truly amazing person, and despite myself, i was more than willing now more than ever to be anything she wanted me to be if she just gave me one last chance. but apparently this girl doesnt have feelings for people based on how they are as a person but more if she holds a certain spark for them. my spark for her is immense and white-hot but her for me is small embers.i hope you guys understand my feelings right now as i typed this with tears rolling down my cheeks as i had to vent my feelings out somewhere. ive heard soon she will be leaving the workplace me and her both work at (which is the only place me and her really get to be together) and i feel like i will never find another girl like her in the world. she always says that even if we wont see each other for a while, she still thinks we are close friends but despite myself i cant see myself without her. she isnt allowed to go out and have social interactions because of her strict parents, so i keep on being afraid she would find someone else in her new job and she would forever be taken from me. shes going to be another reminder of my failure in finding love and i am once again alone. the reason why i desperately seek love is because ive never felt any true love in my own family and i cant get the same feeling from my friends. she was a truly loving person and her family was very loving as well, the kind of family i always wanted growing up and i was more than willing to be a part of. i was willing to have given her the world...now here i am....back at my community college working to transfer to san diego state university, working a second job as programming intern job in a medical/health tech startup. sometimes i contemplate if i should go work at the new place where she is planning to work next just so i can get some quality time with her again. some people would say that i am successful and happy and getting somewhere in life. what they dont know is that deep inside, i am insecure, alone and depressed']\n",

not the sets where you have to follow instructions. i had a large box of lego duplos (the bigger ones) and i just build worlds, cities, landscapes, castles, schools etc. but there was always this dark, grey shadow lingering in the back of my head which i could never grasp. i think i was born with depression but with 11y the first symptoms showed.when i was 11 i had to change school. it is mandatory in my country - basically we sort children into \"bad\", \" medium\" and \"good\" and when they finished school the graduations worth depends on how they were sorted. utterly ridiculous but thats a different story.  the class i had where i had 3 friends got split up in 3 different schools and i ended up alone. but at first it was ... okayish? i had to go to the city by bus to get there and i met new people. at the first day i became friends with a girl. she was the opposite of me, she was optimistic, kind of naive and she liked cute and sparkly things. in my country there are no school uniforms but she kept wearing school clothing from american movies she saw because she thought it was cute, so she wore lots of plaid skirts and blouses. i dont hate what she liked, especially her outfit which i found quite cute as well, thats why we were able to be friends, but my behaviour and looks were totally different.many things changed when i was 11. i hit puberty, without me knowing what it was and how to call it my interest in girls (im lesbian) increased drastically. another girl in that class fit my preferences by 100%. she also had a cute pointy nose which i loved (she however kind of hated it). i didnt know, but i liked her. some of the people i met went into the city after school and although my parents never would have allowed it i still followed them from time to time and we spend some time in shops and went eating ice cream or pizza.but suddenly the black shadow in the back of my mind snapped and like a deep fog it drowned my entire life in nothingness. suddenly it was all gone - my best friend with her pink glitter pens, my first crush with her cute nose, the small trips to stores in the city, everything was gone. i remember one week where i felt tired like i never was before. i felt like my head was filled with nails, my face was burning and the desk was shaking under me while i tried to write. i felt as if i would collapse and my sense of balance was switched off. after one week of tiredness i came home on friday, collapsed behind my rooms door and i cried. i didnt even know why back then. it was the last time i cried for weeks because i went completely numb.i kept going to school, i kept falling almost asleep in school. i started daydreaming, not in a regular way, in an obsessive way. my childish brain couldnt deal with it so i fled into a fantasy world. eventually i remember \"waking up\" for one or two weeks. i realized it was summer already and the school year was over. i realized that not only had i hurt my friend since i stopped talking to her, i also had made my crush extremely angry because i felt like i had to get rid of her since she was disturbing me. i didnt know i was gay, luckily, otherwise it would have hurt way way more. i never went to the city with others again. there was no ice cream after school anymore and no funny pictures with flip phones (im old lol) in ridiculous clothing we found in a store. additionally i also basically ghosted my best childhood friend who didnt know what was wrong with me.what should i have done? i had no idea i even had an issue. i had no idea what depression even was. this circle continued. i was gone for weeks and suddenly realized my life had changed. when i was 14 i woke up again after a massive depressed episode, one of the worst i had so far, and i realized that i was bullied. it happened quite often that i sat in class and someone threw pieces of paper at me. i just picked them up and dropped them to the floor. i didnt hate my bullies. i was just annoyed. i casually mentioned to my mother - and she terrorized my teachers to help me and all of them were in huge trouble. one even apologized - although that was only because his mother forced him to. i didnt want any of this. i even felt sorry they were in trouble.another time i started realizing i had gotten my period a few months ago and that i despised pad so i switched to tampons. that was also when i started to look into the mirror again. i dont know what i always saw for months, but it wasnt me. but one day i saw me - uncombed, oily hair that had turned from golden hazelnut to a greyish mud. my skin was more bluish then red and i had scratched my akne until i developed scars (they luckily disappeared). i was not showered and since i barely smell i didnt know how much i smelled of sweat. it probably was a lot. i was shocked. what i saw was not a 14yo girl, i saw someone who looked like a zombie. that was also the nickname my bullies gave me - and i understood them. the shock was so big i now do shave my armpits and legs almost every single day, drown myself in deodorant and i cut off my hair to a short pixie. the next thing i saw was my breasts that had grown and now were clearly visible. i remember that my mom gave me bras which i didnt wear. i then wore one every single day.the next shock came a few days later. i slowly regained attention to my body after regular showers for a few weeks. i felt sick the entire day. i had lost a lot of weight. on 1.5m i weight 42kg - according to bmi that is too skinny, and i was really skinny. it was surely unhealthy. i had headaches each evening. my mom wouldnt let me stay at home from school because i \"looked much better now\". it was winter and i had to walk from my bus to school for 15 minutes. it was snowing but i only wore a shirt and a thin jacket. my jeans had holes in them and the only shoes i had were 3years old and had holes from daily use.  and i was freezing. i will never forget the cold i suddenly felt for my entire life. i never realized it before but it was there now. and with each step moving felt harder and harder, as if my joints would freeze together. i felt the cold on my bones as if it would drill nails through them. sometimes it wasnt cold anymore, the coldest parts, especially my thighs and fingers, felt like they were set on fire from within and my toes and breasts went numb. i always liked warm weather but this one experience did it for me. whenever i feel cold now i remember this one moment and i could start crying sometimes, other times i start being furious and yell at everyone.when i reached school my hair was frozen from the snow, my skin was pale white with blue rings under my eyes and my lips were dark purple. i was late because i couldnt walk fast. after years of not answering although i was called for at least 5 times already, after looking like i lived in a cave for months and wearing broken shoes and shirts and not being able to remember what day it is so i  walked into the wrong class on a daily basis and after coming to class this morning in basically summer clothing looking like a moor corpse that was stored in the freezer my teacher looked at me - and threatened with detention (or the version we have in my country) if i came late one more time, telling me how kind she is that i only receive an f. i didnt really care back then, i was just glad the windows were closed and the snow was outside.i sat down and my body warmed up a little. but it was too much for my body. i didnt have the strength anymore. in the second lesson that day i got my period and i felt the cramps for the first time. my mom always told me to take ibuprofen when it hurt so thats what i did. which was bad. now i didnt feel the any pain anymore as well. i didnt feel how my knees were getting weaker, i didnt feel how i became sick. in the third lesson we had chemistry and we worked in groups. i was grouped with a girl that at least did talk to me from time to time. and she suddenly realized that i my lips were turning purple again. i am still thankful for her reaction, she did everything correctly. she calmly told the teacher we had to go to the \"room for those who are ill\" (i dont know any word in english for that) so i can lay down on a bench they had somewhere (it was basically a storage room where they squeezed in a bench). she hold my arm when we walked down the stairs and i made it down but when we arrived it was too much. my knees gave in and i was falling. not fast, just slow enough to first sit on my knees and then fall aside. my whole body was shivering. the secretary came and announced through the speakers that someone from the \"nursery team\", aka pupils who made several first aid tests should come down. my blood pressure was extremely low. they gave me coke and chocolate because of the caffeine and sugar to give my body an energy boost. i can remember how my vision was blurry and how i suddenly felt tears in my eyes although i felt... fine? i didnt feel like crying. the shivering was annoying but i could lay down, close my eyes and i didnt have to sit anymore. i had a blanked which warmed me and i felt like suddenly at least someone cared. i tried to assure them i wasnt freaking out and super anxious. they kept me talking for 15 minutes to see how responsive i was but i stayed conscious. my father fetched me half an hour later and they decided i was brought into therapy. thats when i first was diagnosed with a mental illness, back then it was only \" being stressed out\". the diagnosis for depression']\n",

      "['my life was still shit and my depression got no way better. last weeks it got... worse. before i was alternating between two phases: one where i was rather fine and could do my things if someone forced me to (mostly a good friend from uni) and one where i was in bed only wishing i would finally die. but now the last phase is not only constant, it also changes. i have an highly important (personally important, not medically necessary) appointment with a doctor and i hope to get surgery -complicated, takes too long to explain but its nothing that affects my health. i send the shit he gave me to my insurance and they didnt answer yet but thats normal since that takes weeks, sometimes months. anyways, thats the only thing that had been new the last months.so i get more aggressive. whenever theres a slight inconvenience i get angry and either shut down completely and lock myself in or i get violent. i feel like the fight i have now for over 10y dreaded me from all the energy that i once had. i threw a chair through the room and one leg broke, i regularly kick my trashcan, i took my old (inexpensive, i never spend more than 150-200€) phone and threw it against the wall so it broke in tiny pieces, i flipped a small drawer over and everything that was in it flew through my room etc... i also started self harming. i have no knife in my room and since i still live with my parents i only use scissors. when i do i usually go almost blind, i barely feel the pain and i start blindly using anything i have against myself. a few weeks ago i took the scissors and started hitting and scratching my upper arm. i got a few cuts who didnt bleed too much (it wasnt really sharp) but the bruises stayed for weeks. one week ago i took the scissor again, sat down and bulled my knee to my upper body and run the blade through my leg and hip (to get more pressure), now i have a few (deeper) cuts on my hip.another thing is getting up in the morning. let me say it that way: i cant. i barely wake up, my friend from uni stays at my place a lot bc i was late so often to wake me up. it usually takes over half an hour. yes, im a night owl but today i could sleep longer and still didnt wake up. whenever i wake up in the morning i feel like my body is collapsing as if my circulation and blood pressure would drop instantly. i always had that, but now its even worse. i fear it, honestly. i fear the moment when i have to get up in the evening when i go to bed. today was just like that. my friend was there and after 5 attempts to wake me up he opened the blinds. i could still only barely sit up and i spend another 15 minutes on my phone until i stood up. then i drove to uni and it was raining which is something i hate the most (the weather has a 100% direct influence on my health), then it took me 30min to find a parking place and now im done. i already missed half the course, im in the cafeteria now drinking coffee (which i also hate but they dont have green tee).im just... im done. i either want to sleep until forever and never get up again or i want to be drugged so everything feels beautiful. my friend always sais i forgot how to be positive and like the things around me, but thats not true. i never thought this world is beautiful. even as a child i hated this place, but i could just spend my time at home drawing. i never was delusional about my future and i always knew this world is cruel and society sucks. im just tired man, i just want things to end... i missed half this semester already (and i dont think i can catch up until exams anyways) and i just want it to end, which way ever. he also always mentiones other people. his father works a whole fucking lot, has a job and also owns a company and does a lot of other stuff including hobbies. he said \"yesterday he was up until past 1am to do stuff but he also got up at 7am to do other stuff and he can be happy, not everyone suffers like you do\". i just snapped at him that his father doesnt have a circulatory failure each morning either.tl;dr: depression for over 10y, i cant get up in the morning, i self harm, i get more and more aggressive and i am just really really tired of fighting. i want things to end, no matter which way. what should i do? end it? antidepressants']\n",

      "['my anxiety is at an all-time high right now. texting and making phone calls to my friends seems impossible, let alone trying to contact new psychiatrists. leaving my room seems like the biggest challenge in the entire world. i’ve always had anxiety, but it has always been on the back burner to some of my other mental illnesses, and i can’t say i handle anxiety all that well.but on thursday, i answered a friend’s phone call and i left my house for the first time in two months on friday. it was hard, but i made it! yes, i had panic attacks, but i kept on! i didn’t just want to stop there. i want to get better, and i know i can’t get better if i don’t push myself. i left my room yesterday for hours and sat in the living room. it was insanely tough and i panicked quite a bit, but i tried so hard and i’m so proud of myself for not giving up.i called two different psychiatrists today for the second time in an effort to make an appointment with them. (my last one fired me after ten years because i had such difficulties leaving the house to see him. i understand his reasoning, but i am upset that he wasn’t even a little flexible considering my depression']\n",

      "['my roomate was out of town, i lost my scholarship, i was off my meds for about 2 weeks prior... all this shit happened. and on top of that, i went through a fucking rough breakup. impossibly rough. so i looked up a lethal dose of prozac for someone my weight, had lay them out with a bottle of whisky and sent it to my ex and a few other friends.my current ex, s, and i started fighting not long ago about petty shit. i thought she was cheating with two coworkers, l and t. i thought she was lying to me, i was insecure and unstable from my mental illnesses. it got bad. eventually she was at a party with l and t and a few other coworkers and got really drunk with them. a sent me a picture of t and s holding hands, leaning on each other, looked really bad. and he fed me this story about how they were fucking and s was cheating on me. it fucking broke me. l had tried to break us up before, and i know he was having his own issues. i read the texts he sent to s, he was obsessed with s. in a creepy way, s has always said she never liked him. thought he was greasy and creepy. but at the same time i know she liked the attention, and didnt know how to handle it without making that coworker relationship dynamic super awkward.so instead of coping and reaching out for help, or just communicating with s, i messaged my ex. now, this ex and i had a bad history. she fucked with me mentally, she had narcissistic tenancies, gossiped about everything, strung me along for years in high school. she was a theater person, and if there wasnt enough drama, she would make it up herself.anyways, i was hammered, and i messaged her reaching out for help. what to do. etc. and i also texted her about wanting to hookup to get back at s. that s was cheating on me and i didnt know what to fucking do. well, ex told me, \"dude, go to bed. youre drunk, youre upset, just go to bed. sleep it off and whatever.\" and i did. next morning i regretted it and knew this could never happen again, so i deleted her on facebook.next day, turns out l made the whole thing up. he took a video of s and t and took the one frame that looked bad and made up this whole story about it. s backed it up. t backed it up. all of her coworkers backed it up and said l was being weird that night.s and i were already dealing with our own issues, and this whole thing with l and t was a lot, so we just focused on us. getting better, that kind of stuff. and for a month we were great. going on dates again, all sorts of fun shit. i had just moved into an appt closer to my campus, so we were kind of fighting about that. but we were doing things in the city, which was awesome! it was a great time.until before my ex was going to leave back for school, she decides to send s a screenshot of the part where i wanted to hookup. nothing about me asking for help. nothing about being in pain. nothing about drinking my feelings away. nothing about just going to bed. she just wanted to start shit because thats the kind of person she is.it fucking hurt s. she couldnt handle the whole thing, so she said she needed time. whatever, i gave her a few days. kept trying to text her. a week, \"i need time\". another week, \"i need time\". another week \"give me my fucking time and space\". i didnt know what to do. i guess i was in denial about the whole thing, that this was happening. so i kind of just didnt deal with it at all.well, my roomate t sees a picture on instagram of s and l going to ls highschool dance. l is 18, s is 19, im 20. i ask s, what the fuck is it, she doesnt really tell me anything. l starts messaging me and tells me to leave her alone. that she isnt with me anymore, whatever. i tell him to fuck off, and my anger stage was telling him the fuck off. i knew every little detail about his personal issues because he was telling s everything and going to her for advice and i had seen most of it. so i went off about how i knew he was a whiny bitch about being a virgin, how he was a creep, how he was the butt of most of our jokes. how his coworkers talked shit about him, sent him screenshots of it, whatever. just tried to fucking hurt him the most i could. he left it all on read and i could tell it hurt him.well, next day he adds on facebook that hes in a relationship with her. and that was the day i tried to kill myself. s wouldnt tell me what was going on. we had promised that we were getting back together and stuff. she had promised she still loved me but needed time to herself. i was so hurt and betrayed, i wanted to end it all. this was the depression']\n",

      "['myself to be happy, i was getting good grades, and on the surface i seemed like i was successful. i didn’t get into the university of my choice, but i was offered an opportunity to reapply if my gpa was high enough. at my graduation there was this girl i had started talking to from one of my classes. she was a 10/10, but a lot of people i knew didn’t like her because of what one of her ex’s says about her (that she’s crazy and a whore). i offered her some help early that year dealing with some of his crap and we became friends over it. everyone was hugging so i felt no shame in hugging her too. about a month later i broke up with my girlfriend. it took me 3 years to realize the whole time i was being emotionally abused and drained to the point my family noticed a complete change in my happiness. i went to drink the pain away, and instead of drinking alone like an idiot, i wanted to drink with someone that understood the pain i was going through. i texted her and she said yes, but she would have to sneak out. enter one of the best nights of my life and the start to the most memorable summer ever. we started dating two or three weeks later, after i was one of the few people to ask what happened to her when her phone went dark (she had gotten in serious trouble from her parents, no cell), and immediately fell in love with her family and her. she broke me out of a shell i had no idea i was in. we were sporadic, doing things on a whim. i had always wanted to live my life on a “why not” basis, and that was the only way we did anything. we would only plan for bigger things, occasionally throwing them out for better ones. in the summer she allowed me to experience what it meant to have fun, and to enjoy life. fall hit her hard though. she has so many problems from her dad leaving her family, one of which is seasonal depression. when i went off to college, we tried to make it work. she started to exist on seeing me on that once a week schedule, me being the only one to make her feel happier and fulfilled. meanwhile i had so much trouble adjusting and taking the pressure. i cut for the first time just before i left, and cut again later in the semester. i was disgusted with myself, but for some reason i still did it again. one night i nearly put a knife through my forearm, and another with my girlfriend, had a panic attack while drunk. she forced me to seek a therapist, and without that i likely would have been making this post. i cried on the way back home with her, and she was right there for me, realizing how fucked up i was. to say that it was all perfect though would be an oversight. we did break up during the semester and she did see someone for a one time thing. i decided not to hold it against her because of what she meant to me, and because it was totally stupid on her part. we would bicker at times too, often times because i would say something stupid because of a lack of social skills and her belief that she was fragile. yet it still worked until about middle of the semester where she greened out at a party and woke up to a guy who made a move on her. that was some final straw for her, and i think it broke her on some level and we broke up for the second time. assuming she needed time to figure things out, i started talking to close friends about the incident to get their opinions. i spoke to one of them who i forgot was a mandatory reporter. for the sake of brevity, i had to make a police report, and the night i made it she got a phone call from the local police department and the next day three officers showed up in her school. she screamed at me, but i knew what was at stake and what i had just done. her family lived on a knifes edge, and she was trying to repair her relationship with her mom. her friends could have started asking questions, possibly leaving her. her freedom became questionable, as she was getting high again, which was the reason in the summer she had got in so much trouble. but nothing happened. and i had to fix this. i hadn’t played piano in 10 years, yet two days after she screamed at me, i began again. in 10 days, i learned the song that symbolized the entire thing to me. i originally gave myself a window of 14 days, but i was ready. i recorded it and sent it to her, with the best apology i could have come up with. “it’s beautiful, but it doesn’t change anything.”and i knew that. but again in vain i still tried, i promised myself i would be home for her birthday so i was. i had already started on her gift and gave it to her. i just wanted to have a true conversation with her about all of this. to get closure and to understand what the future would hold. i have her my gift and asked her to talk to me, so we did. we talked for two hours. it came down to us being fundamentally different people, but agreeing we were each other’s best. that we could not be friends because the feelings would be to great. that we should try to move on from each other, and maybe decades down the line reconnect. when we hugged as a final goodbye, my throat hitched. she pulled away and put her hand on my face. she realized what she did immediately, but that was the moment that i became me. that i started to close off again.it was like this until she wished me happy birthday. she was the only one to do so, because i tell no one about it. but even my best friends didn’t say a word, so it meant something to me. i’m hindsight it was rather innocuous, but i dwelled on it for a little while. then walking through the city with my family it happened for the first time. i was looking at christmas lights and i saw us. laughing, looking up at the lights, holding each other. i blinked and it was gone. those moments have been happening occasionally since, in places that meant something to me or to us. i will see us in the perfect instagram ready photo, and it will ruin me for the day. i’ve tried my best to move on, got a tinder, started talking to as many people as possible. nothing works, and i realized it’s because i’ve been given the gift of caring for others: not flirting. so i’m going to delete my tinder and make sure that i’m not so stupid moving forward. about a week ago, i noticed her instagram post were getting progressively more depressing. she blocked me and unblocked in a span of 12 hours. i decided to say something, not as someone wanting her back, but as someone who was genuinely concerned. she said she was fine, and we texted until i got a one word response. now to summarize: we have the girl who broke me out of my shell and helped me experience life. who probably stopped me from someday killing myself. who was the one who taught me what true love really meant. and that i ruined in one action, to destroy any future chance i had. what i want now is what i wanted two months ago. i want this fixed, and i want to be able to hold her again. i decided this january i would think about making another attempt to reconnect, but if it seems too much i won’t. i really think it’s done and over with. i don’t need to hear the crap about “there’s so many other fish in the sea.” i know there are. but how many fish do you believe you owe your life to? that you think about every night? that you sometimes cry yourself to sleep over?if i had the chance again, i would live my life to the fullest with her. i’d change my dreams based on this one delusion. and i’m not sure if the world would agree with me. i just needed to put this in writing. if you’re still with me, am i crazy? i already know i’m depressed']\n",

      "['my depression was in check. wasn’t getting the blues as much, and wasn’t feeling particularly bad about myself. hadn’t felt the need to “escape” from my life in a while. just went to colorado with my girlfriend for a week for a friend’s wedding. saw many friends i don’t get to see very often. had an amazing time, weather was amazing, went for some wonderful hikes. big, gorgeous mountains everywhere. things were amazing all around.got back to the east coast three days ago, took a day off work. been very late for work the past two days and this morning i am really really really feeling the depression. feels fucking awful. i’m getting all those feelings and thoughts back: the “hop on a plane and never come back” fantasy, the maladaptive daydreaming and inevitable disappointment, etc. heart is heavy for no good reason. annoyed at everybody for no reason. i was walking to catch the train like i do every morning for work, already very late. told myself, “if i miss this train, i will call out of work”. train pulled up and was out of range for me to make it to the door on time. i should’ve been running but my willpower was zapped. i kept walking anyway at normal speed. as i got closer, i noticed the train wasn’t moving. i approached the platform and noticed a handicapped person getting on the train, which is why it was taking so long for the train to leave. conductor looked at me and said, “i’ll hold the door for you”. so i ran up the stairs and ran into the train door. i partially wanted the train to leave so i could be depressed on my own away from work, but i caught the train because the conductor was nice about it. anyway, here i am on the way to work. i’m going to be super late, but work will maybe help me take my mind off of how depressed']\n",

(mediocre post)so tonight i had a suicide fantasy. i was sitting at my kitchen/livingroom/holyshitmyapartmentissmall table with a bottle of bourbon and all of my wellbutrin, popping them every few minutes, with an x-acto knife next to me and a suicide note on paper and on the computer, ready to put on social media. then my fiancé comes in unexpectedly with a mutual friend. they find me in shambles and drive me to the hospital to get my stomach pumped. i had control over that, so i guess i wanted to be found? i did it the other way too, where i climbed up on the roof, laid back, my head at the lower end of the pitch, sliced up my arms and neck, and my neighbor finds me, or my fiancé finds me (it changed a few times). it was like a really fucking depressing']\n",

      "['my life was honestly perfect looking back. had my beautiful house in a nice neighborhood i’d ride my bike in every day. had my parents who even though i’m not as close as i’d like to be were there. had two of the most amazing women in that roof too, my sisters. had a few friends, one that was most dearest to me. and the cherry on top, my girlfriend, the person that, about to be ten months together, i love with all my heart.i was extremely happy. the happiest i’ve ever been. and then everything changed. it all started slowly, when my gymnastics class got shut down. it sucked, i loved going there and the people there, it hit hard. then i had to move to another city for college, and i’ve been so depressed ever since i came here.i moved into a tiny house, just me and only one of my sisters, i have a different bed that is not as soft as my bed back in town. but what really makes me depressed is the fact that i feel like everything that made me happy was just taken away. i don’t have my bed, i don’t have my room, i don’t leave said room and see my little sister in hers, i don’t walk downstairs and see my mom in the kitchen, i don’t see my dad fixing whatever he can around the house, i don’t take my girlfriend on dates every weekend, i don’t kiss her every time i see her in the hallway, i don’t get to touch her often. i don’t anymore.my girlfriend, my beautiful girlfriend that every single day i thank the universe for, the only person i’ve ever loved as much in my life, the prettiest girl in the universe, is the part that hits the hardest. we have a very physical relationship, holding hands, kisses, hugs, and even though she doesn’t exactly love it,  tickles, she just reacts so cutely. and with me moving she’s also been down. it’s been hard. weeks before i left were just filled with sadness and uncertainty, and when i came here we were counting down the day we’d see each other again.  again, it’s been hard, so damn hard.the reason for the tittle is that i feel like i can’t be happy how i want to, i have to wait weeks to see my parents and my girlfriend for just one day because it would be so expensive to so every weekend. i can’t do what i love. my birthday is coming up, and my girlfriend can’t (for a reason that i completely understand) come, my parents might, and i don’t know if my new friends. i feel miserable, i spend my nights thinking \"why did you have to come here?\"i can’t stand having to tell my girlfriend that it’ll be weeks until i see her again, last time it was a month. i can’t stand the feeling that my parents are investing so much money for my education and that i might screw up. i can’t stand feeling so embarrassed by not texting my friends. i can’t stand that sometimes i just can’t literally afford being happy. they say money doesn’t buy you happiness, but it would certainly that bus ticket to see my girl, to go to the trampoline park and how i like to call it, flip the pain away.i can’t stand crying myself to sleep i hate not being able to be happy the way i want to and that depression makes it worse. i have so very few things that make me happy here with me. i miss my perfect life.i’m studying because i want to change that, but coming here has just made everything harder. i really hate what’s been doing to my girlfriend and i constantly feel like i’m hurting her even though she says it’s not my fault, i just don’t want to hurt her. i feel miserable knowing that my little sister is just alone with my mom. i feel bad that my dad is alone in another city.as i write this, it’s midnight and i’m crying here in my bed. debating whether i should at the very least show to my girlfriend. i feel powerless,i feel like i can’t be as happy as i was.tl;dr moved to a new city for school, depression']\n",

(i wish i could see a doctor or therapist, as well; however, my parents blow over every request i make to see one, since either a.) its a waste of money or b.) mental illness is all in your head).going back to my brother, he had an hour long conversation about my attitude and my depression']\n",

      "['my head above the water for long enough to recognize my plight: i was very anxious.&nbsp;that was 8 years ago, and since that point i have learned more and more about what makes me tick, and why i am the way i am.&nbsp;the first realization was that i was transgender. for the next few years i spent most of my time doing some internal questioning about what that meant for me and what the next steps would be. i even attempted transition, but found that it provided no benefit to me in practical life. up until about a year ago, i thought this thing i knew about myself was the end-all-be-all. it explained everything i experienced, why social interactions were hard for me, and seemingly every other issue i could recall from my past. or so i thought.&nbsp;when you begin to dig really deep into gender and who you are compared to others, you may find that you arent so different...&nbsp;still, i knew what i needed to do, and that was transition, and transition i did. soon enough, however, it became clear that my life was no better than it was before, just different. i had traded one set of obstacles for another without any net gain. so i gave it up, and went back to being myself.&nbsp;that was about 6 months ago. still, the question remained: if so many people out there are able to achieve a modicum of peace and success in their lives despite hurdles like that, why cant i?&nbsp;i began looking at my upbringing. i found that from my perspective, my family seemed loving and relatively happy. i was the son of a single mother of two, who was the daughter of a successful stock broker and home-making wife, whom had 4 healthy kids, all who had kids themselves. we spent christmases and thanksgivings together as a family, with smiles and laughs and all the things you could hope for growing up.&nbsp;i had a father who tried to be a dad, at least when i was younger, but had a lot of mental issues including addiction, alcoholism, and general assholery. eventually our relationship went from distant to non-existent. i didnt know his family.&nbsp;i loved my family, or at least thought i did...im not as sure now (since love itself is in question). like i said, i have little outside perspective, so its hard for me to see what issues there might be. and as a disclaimer: im thankful for what ive had. i really couldnt have asked for a better childhood, i had a lot of really care-free times as a kid. but since i have failed in all aspects of life, from relationships to work over and over, i have to ask questions.&nbsp;couple things to point out: almost every member of the family has dealt with anxiety or depression, or is dealing with them now. when we meet, its almost an assumed thing that one of us is dealing with it at any given time, since its hard to hide when you know someone. &nbsp;second thing: appearances have always been of utmost priority to my family. the general rule is: if youre not happy, look happy, or try to hide your sadness as best as you can. if youre angry, dont be direct, that might hurt someones feelings or cause an issue, and we dont want issues.&nbsp;ive spent time with other families, and they might give each other shit, maybe even argue or fight from time to time. that never happened in my family save for a couple of occasions. that brings me to the relationship with my mom: we never fought. ever. disagreements were mild, with my mom usually relenting to my view on things to save from having hard conversations. didnt do my chores? an exhasperated laugh followed by\"i really wish you wouldve done them.\" and then id feel guilty enough to do them. a couple years ago i started to realize that i felt like if i truly were to go against her wishes, she would abandon me. whether that would happen or not, i dont know, but it was this deep, existential feeling that i could never overcome, and is still there. like im on the verge of being abandoned by the only person that cares.&nbsp;she also seems to be completely unable to offer any emotional support, though not for lack of trying. she will listen to me explain how im feeling, and try to offer solutions, but somehow i come away feeling worse. ive learned not to talk about feeling bad around her because things only get worse.&nbsp;she also has some major depression']\n",

      "['myself and i know even though it’s alright now i’m definitely slipping. even through my life sucked and especially from age 12 to now, i was able to do things very well. the abuse at home was awful but i went to a boarding school and basically preoccupied myself there to distract myself. the exams i sat when i was 16 i averaged 93% across 12 subjects. i got maximum grades for everything. and yes i worked hard, but i still didn’t find it difficult to juggle 4 languages, sciences, piano, violin, and still have time for my passion. my passion is really important to me, i’ve spent more time and thought and energy on it than anything else. i think it’s the only thing in my life which has purpose; i taught myself how to make clothes when i was 12 and from there i started designing and basically got better and better and actually got good at it. it’s something i want a career in but i’m also torn. i can only afford to do it if i’m really good at it, because it’s expensive as it is, let alone to be ‘trying’ in this industry. it’s a lot to do with exposure, and for exposure, you need a portfolio and for a portfolio you need time and confidence.i don’t have time now because as i mentioned - i can’t get anything done. it sounds strange to say, but something broke in me for a number of reasons when i was 16 and i’ve never been the same. i don’t feel as motivated and i’ll only do the minimum to reach my goal. i did get into the most competitive school in the country. i am a law student so i “must be clever” - but all that is on paper. i was actually lucky to get here, and yes on natural ability i got full marks in several exams which allowed me to slack and get b-ds in others. in the u.k. it’s misty traditional examination so i reallt was lucky. i did work hard but very last minute and risky, as if i didn’t want it. i do want to study law and i never wanted to study anything else. not even a fashion degree - i love it and i study fashion in my own time but i’m not entirely sure i would want to study at an art school. but fashion is what i want to make a career out of, law is just something that i find very interesting, my parents would approve of, is useful for business, and i like the philosophy of it. however, i’m struggling with my degree alone. it’s getting very monotonous and difficult, and even just going to and lectures doing the assignments is too much to handle. i can’t finish anything i start. i can hardly read for more than 5 minutes straight. and because i can’t do even that, i don’t have time for anything else, which means i’m succeeding at nothing. i often don’t complete essays (optional ones), and through procrastination i’m always late with assignments. i just hate what i do and how i am and i never used to be like this.    it’s not really a phase if it’s lasted this long, and i’m worried since i’m young, it’s becoming a part of who i am. i now feel anxious because i’m not meeting my potential. i know i’m still capable and on paper i’m at a great stage, but actually i have little to show for my capabilities. i’m basically letting myself down and i don’t trust myself so i try less and less. i should say, my depression']\n",

i miss being in complete aww, just taking in a moment of beauty.. you know what i see with a phone.. a bill.. a reminder that no one’s texted me, an outlet that means you are connected to the world, 24/7, never getting a break.. i check it.. no matches on tinder either aha why the fuck did i even sign up for that?..it comes time for dinner and we had your favorite.. cooked ham with that string bean casserole my aunt makes. it wasn’t as good as the years passed, but i think it was only because you weren’t there to remind me how good it was.. you would have psyched because i think she even added extra onion straws we’re eating around the table and i’m sitting at the head, because everyone wanted to sit next to their so’s, and there was only one chair at the end.. i volunteer as tribute, because why not? let them enjoy the time.. i know it’s not that big a deal, and they wouldn’t even mind, but things just happened that way..i think that’s where i made the mistake.. pretty much just asking to be talked to by those relatives who i only see three times a year..then it happened.. i hadn’t seen or talked to these relatives in a long time“hey dugefrsh, where’s [my girlfriend]? at her parents today? i made extra casserole just for her!”it’s kind of cliche to say especially because people say it a lot.. but it was like a scene from a movie..the kitchen becomes pretty quiet and she could tell she messed up and gave me a sad look to say i’m sorry. how was she supposed to know? it’s okayi play it off and just smile “ haha she’s doing well, her and her mother are on vacation this week i believe, so they’re out of state”the sigh of brief relief that swept over her face didn’t last long and she kept asking about her and telling me how cute she was and how she was so much fun to talk to..the line that hurt most was when she said she fit in perfect with our family..“she was perfect i know aunty”and it’s sort of my fault too i guess, i could have just told her that we’re not together anymore and been done with it, but i didn’t want to embarrass her finally my dad coughed and i told her we were no longer seeing each other anymore..play it off coy, everyone gets back to chatting and the situation rolls over.. i don’t usually drink a red wine, but we were out of white and i didn’t want a beer. i sat there at the head of the table playing with a bowl of jellybeans, and i even picked out all the black ones and put them off to the side, sort of like i was saving them for you.. i can’t believe you liked those you weirdo hahai finally had a moment without thinking about you today though.. the bruins game was on and was a welcome distraction; that and the alcohol was helpingwhen the game finishes up all the kids want to watch frozen.. i can’t do that..when i would sing do you wanna build a snowman to you and you’d laugh.. i can’t do it..thankfully though my parents wanted to leave.. as i’m in the back seat again, the pulsing of the passing street lamps make it a little hard to close my eyes.. when i’m staring at the stars, it’s such a lame, grandiose and romanticized way of thinking, but i knew they were the same stars that you were looking at.. it hit me that that was one time i was in aww.. looking at stars with you..after i finish this drink, i’m gonna try and get some rest though..if i’m lucky i’ll just pass out and don’t have to cry too long..maybe i’ll start the moving on process?.. it’s never taken me this long to get over someone..maybe i’ll try it in the morning.. maybe tomorrow will be the day i beat this stupid depression']\n",

      "['my biological parents and family, by my peers, etc. and then when i became a teenager it was love interests. i’ve faced nothing but romantic and sexual rejection since i was 17. i’ve tried everything people suggest and i read about. a person i chat with online (who is literally someone who rejected me) told me that i need a new mindset. well he has success to balance out his negatives, and has a boyfriend that he found after leading me on and rejecting me. i have nothing but rejection to reference, not even a rare success here and there to help me think it’s even possible for me. i even got desperate enough to chat up twitter/insta gays. it’s no use. the closest i’ve come to another man giving me any attention was when i had a rough night and watched web cams and tipped guys. the sad thing is that gay guys are easy...and yet i’m still not good enough for any of them? i don’t understand what’s wrong with me and why i’m so worthless in their eyes (well i know why, but i don’t understand why it’s so important).    i’ve watched my friends and peers mature and grow relationship wise and experiment sexually since high school...and because of this a part of my growth is stunted. a funny thing is that people come to me for relationship advice constantly. somehow watching all of these relationships and hookups others get to enjoy made me wise about love...go figure i’ll never actually benefit from it.    now to add another quality to the list of reasons to reject me: i’m almost a 30-year-old virgin. it’s not an endearing or wholesome quality to anyone. it shows a lack of experience, the inability to please anyone sexually (and sex is important in a relationship). and it also shows my lack of experience being a boyfriend.    i have nothing to attract anyone, and i have almost no motivation to work on things i can change when the things i can’t change are what keep me back.    i just deleted all my browser histories and canceled all my porn subscriptions. i want to become chaste at this point and erase all sexual and romantic desire from my being. they’ve brought me nothing but pain and self-loathing.    i can never be happy. every minute of every day i think of my loneliness and horniness and how everyone i’ve ever put myself out there for has stomped on my heart and would rather be with some cheating asshole loser because he has an 8” dick.    nowadays i also have to fight off incel/“nice guy” tendencies because they tend to overpower me the more entrapped i become by my loneliness, bitterness, and self-loathing. i’m slowly becoming a terrible person. i did something really terrible the other day. i made a fake grindr account to harass a mexican guy at my school who rejected me...i told him i was reporting him to ice, found his personal info through his linked social media, and sent a screenshot to him of me putting his information in the ice report form (no, i did not submit it). the sad thing is i have family members who are vietnam war refugees who could be facing deportation...i know how disgusting and racist it is what i did...but it was like his rejection overpowered me and i snapped. i eventually apologized to him, told him that the report was fake, and then told him that this isn’t who i am and am just in a dark place.    i’m not this person, but my depression']\n",

      "['my successful regimen is not guaranteed to be yours, but it doesnt hurt to share this experience with your doctor and ask if something similar might also help.) &#x200b;i have suffered from depression for most of my life. i only started getting treatment in my 20s, and its been about 17 years since i started different treatments, off and on.about 5 years ago, i was put on paxil. it worked really well for a while, then it not only stopped working, but i started to get really severe anhedonia. i basically just felt like \"whats the point?\" about anything i could do for fun.recently, my depression and anxiety started to come back severely. i went to seek treatment, mentioned how anhedonia was a huge part of my life now, and how paxil basically stopped working before i weened myself off of it, a couple of years ago.the doctor prescribed me to excitalopram, and i was already off and on taking agomelatine at night to help with sleeping regularly, as well as to lessen my anxiety in the next day. the combination has been working well to control the severity of my depressive episodes, but nothing really helped with my anxiety.i also have adhd, and because im not a kid anymore, its hard to have that taken seriously. i live in china, which makes getting medicine for adhd extremely difficult. the gov is afraid of people abusing stimulants, so the process of getting stimulants for treatment is rigorous to the point that most doctors wont even try.so, with that taken into account, i pushed my psychologist to consider medicinal treatment (at our session the month before, he tried telling me to practice mindfulness and focusing exercises, which doesnt help for anhedonia aggravated lack of motivation.) he prescribed me to haloperidol.man, what a difference. the first day, i felt like i could sleep for a million years, i was worried it was going to be a failure because i couldnt even keep my eyes open.the second day, i took it before bed, then i woke up a bit groggy. after i got up and had a shower, i felt much better, and more importantly, i had actual feelings.i excitedly considered writing some music, and this is where my anhedonia and adhd would normally sap my will to do anything. id normally start thinking of all the stuff id have to do to set up my music equipment, all the wires thatd need to be untangled, and how id have to put it all back again after. then id think about how my music isnt really loved by anyone, what am i writing it for? why am i doing it? who cares if i do or i dont? (this is the combination of anedonias \"nothing matters anyway\" and adhds \"lets flood you with a thousand thoughts and make you forget why you even had the thought in the first place.\")none of this happened. it tried to for a second, then i just said \"fuck it, this is my body, i can make it do these things\" (getting all the stuff out and setting it up), so i started doing it.within an hour i had a song, then another, then another, etc. the next day was the same, i was in chat rooms about music, talking about my hobby oh my god, its my hobby, i have a hobby, a thing i love doing!!!. sorry for the caps, but this realization hit me.its only been a week, but the effects have been stable. im not super excited and hyped up, i can just think of doing something and start doing it. and as im doing it, i dont constantly have this negative voice devaluing what im doing or sapping all the joy out of it. im not plagued by a suicidal cheer leader who wants nothing more than to make me give up and lay there till i die.i say all of this because i know what depression feels like. theres always the chance that ill have to adjust my meds in the future as one med becomes less effective or whatever. all i can say is that for the first time in a while, i feel like hope actually exists in the world.im glad i talked to my psychologist about dealing with adhd. i havent treated adhd since i was a late teen, and i only treated it for a short period of my life. had i not brought up the topic of adulthood adhd, i wouldnt have found out that an antipsychotic medication (haloperidol) could quiet that shitty nagging \"nothing you do matters\" voice in my head and let me reconnect with the things i used to enjoy.i hope whatever your method of action, please believe me when i tell you. ive spent the last 4 years of my life being absolutely certain that depressed or not depressed, joy was a lie i used to tell myself and id somehow figured out that nothing joyful was ever real.here i am, only a week later and its like the heaviest darkest fog has been removed from in front of my eye, or pulled out of my heart.i hope you find the will to keep trying to beat your depression']\n",

      "['my early 20s. since my teen years, probably starting around 17 or 18, ive been on a rollercoaster of ups and downs, each of which usually last a few months at a time, although it varies. my initial, long ago feelings of depression stemmed from not knowing how to talk or interact with girls, having been a sheltered youth that went to an all boys high school. i went through several years thinking i wasnt good enough for anyone, feeling immense loneliness even though i had plenty of guy friends that truly liked and cared about me.well i finally learned a few years ago kinda how to get girls. and when this happened my rollercoaster went to one of its highest \"ups\" ever. i was meeting and sleeping with girls, finally. i loved it.  last year, i met a girl who became absolutely infatuated with me. she loved and adored me. she told me this numerous times. we were perfectly compatible in bed. perfectly compatible. at the point of meeting her i had already had several partners and she was the first one that made me truly enjoy sex. she desired me. i desired her. the whole time i was \"with\" her (with in quotations because i never dated her, we kinda just texted a lot and had sex on the weekends) i basically treated her like shit. took her for granted. i thought,subconsciously, \"look how much this girl loves and wants me, i must be the shit, i dont really need her cause i can get any girl i want.\" the confidence boost of having someone love me so much and think i was so attractive made me think any girl could feel the same way about me. so after about 9 months, i told her i wanted to stop seeing her.she was devastated. begged me not to go. i said no, were not meant for each other. i didnt see her for 2 months over the summer. i had no girls, and i missed her, but i was still confident in myself. i still thought i was attractive, had a lot to offer. but i missed her. i realized i made a mistake. and i texted her saying so. and she said sorry, but i wasted too much time on you, someone who constantly told me that they didnt love me, so now i started seeing someone else. so now shes gone. its been several months since then, and i havent talked to her since, besides one little hiccup in the middle where we talked for a day, but its irrelevant to this post. i still think about how good i had it, and i still miss her every day, and i always think about how stupid i was to throw it away. in the moment i didnt think i even liked her, but i guess its true that you dont know what you have till its gone. well if this was all i had to deal with, i would be ok because eventually i believe i would be able to find another girl. but over the summer, i started losing my hair, rapidly. im 22. i know this isnt stress related because 1. early onset baldness runs in my family, and 2. i started a drug to help my hair loss (which i had noticed last year before it started to get really bad) and stopped the drug because i felt like it was not working. well. my hair had become dependent on the drug, and began to really recede and thin out rapidly. so. im balding at 22. i am a tall, skinny, very pale, babyface guy who cant grow a beard and has a large skull with a narrow face. i cannot pull off the bald look. at all. i can look at pictures of myself from 4 months ago and see a very noticeable difference in how i look. i used to be a youthful looking attractive guy who got compliments from girls all the time. now i feel like an old man, in a matter of months. i have zero confidence left. absolutely none. i spend all day every day thinking about my hairline, taking and analyzing pictures of myself, going to the bathroom every 20 minutes just to see if my hair looks ok. i feel, in my heart, that my dating life is over. i feel like no girl will ever want me again. i was so confident in myself and my looks 4 months ago, and now, nothing.  this makes my regret for ending my relationship increase 1000x. i had someone that loved me for me, and was so animalistically attracted to me, and i was to her, and now its done forever. i will never have that again. and if i made a different decision a few months ago i couldve had it for the rest of my life, even if i was bald.people will tell me to lower my standards, but im attracted to what im attracted to. my standards used to be attainable. now i feel like theyre not. and my hair situation will never get better, only worse. im 22 and i feel like the prime of my life is over.all these things have led me to being depressed']\n",

(shout-out to /r/keto and /r/skincareaddiction!) i started following the advice i was given through these threads, making these improvements in myself that i *could actually see*, and it felt amazing. it feels amazing. its going to continue to feel amazing. i can talk to people now without feeling like a nervous wreck. i have confidence. sure, i stutter a lot but i can get my point across.i guess what im trying to say is thank you. really. just for existing. i feel high all the time now. when i think of how close i came to killing myself, i feel so goddamn grateful that i didnt. *i almost jumped*... if i did, i wouldnt be able to experience these emotions. theyre like lsd, its crazy. i know everyones story is different, but i just want to tell you to hold on. whatever you are going through, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. i seriously wish there was a less cliche way of saying that. but its true. actively try and help yourself, reap positive benefits. just you fucking hold on.tl;dr- after discovering reddit, threads helped me improve myself, warding off depression']\n",

      "['my life. its been sort of ingrained in me to be humble by my parents, and i still believe its a good trait to have. but ever since high school ive been especially hard on myself, because during my freshman year i went full on slacker and my grades went to shit; more zeros than anything. after that my family moved and i worked hard to rebuild myself, doubling down on the mentality that im an idiot/asshole, and it worked. i even got into my first relationship with someone who was objectively a shitty person who hurt me horribly at the end, yet i still miss her. sorry for my writing being all over the place, im kind of having a mental break and typing helpstheres a little backstory. my mom dated an asshole we lived with for eight years who verbally abused us both and would hit her. one day when i was at a day camp over the summer i kind of snapped. i dont know how to describe it other than a psychotic break or something. i randomly became horribly paranoid of everything. i remember sitting in the hall of the school that camp was held at, a totally empty hall with no obstructions to my line of sight, shivering in fear of something i couldnt really explain to anyone. (this was the summer after my 5th grade) when i got home that day i didnt want to shower because i thought a bug would fly into one of my orifices and lay eggs or something, which was somewhat justified as we had an earwig problem. i wouldnt brush my teeth because i was too worried about swallowing a bit of toothpaste and being poisoned. when i washed my hands, i kept my mouth closed out of fear that soap would splash in there, yet i still washed them excessively, and i mean like every five minutes excessively. even my moms boyfriend, who was ocd himself, was getting pissed at me. i would hoard spit in my cheek rather than swallow if i thought there was anything toxic in there. this went on for a good couple of years throughout middle school, where i was more concerned about imaginary things killing me than my grades, or at least thats how i like to justify it. by eighth and ninth grade i was a pariah, a class clown who tried too hard to make friends, and i dont remember having any.so maybe thats why i miss being in a toxic relationship. maybe if i build up someone in my mind like i did with her, i can feel happy about myself because im with her. but that wasnt the case, i constantly worried about where we stood even at the best of our relationship. she wanted to marry me, but circumstances kept us from seeing each other and i always worried what she was doing. was she seeing someone else? that kind of thing. and i was right. she got back with her ex and told me we needed a break, and that shed let me know her choice in a month. that broke me. i was so fucking miserable i broke it off with her totally, leaving casualties in the form of a big rant over the phone about the douche she was dating and all but telling her to go to hell. it was the first time i had stood up to someone like that, and it lasted. i was an easygoing guy (on the outside anyway) until my senior year, when this happened, and i spent the rest of high school in a state of...idk, not really apathy but sort of defensively. i ignored our mutual friends assuming they had all sided with her, but i did end up dating a girl we both knew. we got too serious while i was still resentful over my ex, and it was this attitude that drove her away too.months later when im reconnecting with an old friend, i learn that, in fact, a number of my friends had sided with me but i never bothered trying to approach them. fuck. i spent my last year of school miserable for no good reason, i didnt even go to my prom or walk at graduation because i thought people hated my guts. and i cant shake that feeling, i work in retail yet i get more and more dismissive and resentful as time passes. ive become cynical as fuck and its pushed away said old friend. i want to write fiction as a career and i draw occasionally, and im less and less motivated to do either of them because im always so angry and exhausted from work. im really insecure about my body on top of all that, i was pretty fat through middle school but i managed to burn it through high school and now im a twig. im not even tall enough to be skinny, i found out recently im 511 after years of assuming im at least 6 feet because of the shorter women i dated. and the dude my ex left me for is at least 62. i dont buy into redpill shit or anything but it was pretty crushing. ive kind of grown to...not idolize, but look to slasher films as inspiration to stay strong back when i was alone in school, like friday the 13th, so i could feel tough and project some kind of confidence. i fucking hate myself for having to look at fictional serial killers for self esteem. not to mention theyre mostly, if not all at least six feet tall.i dont even remember what the point of posting this was, im more depressed']\n",

      "['my story on here for a while and so i’m finally pulling the trigger. during my last major depressive episode (just over a year ago), i believed that i would never get better. i was intent on killing myself and it enraged me when people would try to tell me it would get better. so if you’re in that place as you’re reading this, bear with me. because depression & suicide runs in my family, i was lucky enough to be surrounded by loved ones who are very educated about mental illness. on an afternoon, at a time when i already had my suicide plan in place, my granny (grandma) shared some stories with me about other family members who had killed themselves. in the process of talking about this, she shared some very specific ways that those deaths (some of them over 35 yrs ago) affect her & my papa (grandpa) to this day. she also explained to me in great detail the specific way our health care system works in regards to mental health & urged me to take the necessary steps (which she clearly laid out for me) to see a psychiatrist. after that conversation, i decided that i would wait until she & my papa had passed away before killing myself. for her, i went to see the psychiatrist although i definitely did not believe it would make a difference. when there’s awareness about mental health it makes identification & treatment possible. without my granny’s knowledge & willingness to both talk & listen, i would be dead. i had previously experienced four other major depressive episodes in my life. in each of those scenarios, i would eventually end up both in counselling to talk about it & at the doctor’s office for prescriptions. it would take months (& often many med changes) before i noticed any difference. after seeing a psychiatrist who had the necessary knowledge to talk about the right things and prescribe the right cocktail of medication at the same time, i literally felt like a different person after two weeks.awareness promotes knowledge, knowledge allows for the correct treatment, & when the proper treatment is applied, recovery is faster.mental health awareness is so important to me because its presence in my world has allowed me to feel the joy and contentment that laying down with a cup of tea & three sweet dogs sleeping on top of me brings. so first, i just want to encourage each of us to speak out during the times we have the strength and ability to do so. our struggle is not one to be ashamed of. and last, if you’re depressed']\n",

we barely saw each other due to our busy schedules (only in weekends), we didnt spend quality time together, we got into little fights because we were stressed, she wasnt comfortable at my home because my dad also lived with us and it just wasnt a place that felt like home, she made new friends in the city she works in but could hardly see them due to travel times, we had trouble finding a place for ourselves, among other things.in march she already tried to break up with me when we got into a small fight. she was clearly upset. she said she didnt love me anymore, that she wants to feel love in different places, and that she wants to have a her/our own place. i begged her to stay and eventually she decided to stay.in april i showed her more love and things went pretty well. however, at the end of the month and especially in may things turned for the worse again. we got back into the drag and the love and intimacy faded again. about halfway may she apparently had enough and searched for her own place in the city she works in without telling me. two weeks later she had packed her stuff and told me she was leaving. again she told me she didnt love me anymore and that she wanted to leave. she just didnt believe in me anymore, that i could make her happy and she didnt want to commit to me. i helped her move the next day and managed to convince her to take a break. this only lasted 3 days because i stupidly called her up in an emotional state. she got angry and then really broke up with me.i was completely shocked both times when she wanted to break up with me. for me it came all out of nowhere. i managed to see her some days after the break up to talk about it. after having analyzed all that happened the past few months, i was convinced that it was just due to the stressful situation we were in. she told me that wasnt the case. she just said she doesnt love me anymore, that she doesnt believe i can make her happy, and that we do not fit in our core. i also told her that i made mistakes, but i was mostly putting the blame on the situation. we decided to stay friends. she still liked me and i suspect she still has feelings for me because she was very conflicted and emotional about breaking up with me. perhaps those are just high hopes though.ever since the break-up, i have been a complete wreck. i cried and raged for days. i didnt eat and couldnt sleep. i got a break from my internship. i failed two exams. i felt incredibly depressed and even suicidal. i just wanted to end it. occasionally, i felt motivated. i was desperately trying to look for ways to get her back. i contacted relationship experts and bought some of their products. i also talked to family and friends about it. surprisingly, i managed to get a place of my own. my situation didnt get better though. i did have contact with my ex, but progress was slow. after a month or so i got professional help because it was all getting out of hand. a psychologist diagnosed me so far with having an acute depression. a friend of mine also suggested me a book about narcissism as he himself is a narcissist and recognized a lot of the traits in me.fast forward to now and my situation has still not improved. i still long for my ex. i love her deeply and even consider her the love of my life. i feel extremely depressed and suicidal. i also dont feel like i am somebody as if im an empty shell. i dont know what to do with my life anymore, im not motivated at all and i have constant panic attacks because i fear losing my ex forever, never getting her back. i am getting professional help, but its a slow process. i was referred to a clinical psychologist who i had my intake with just yesterday. my next meeting is in two weeks.looking at myself and back at the last months of the relationship, i have the feeling that im mentally ill. i suspect that i either have a narcissistic personality disorder or a borderline personality disorder. its hard to say though as im no professional, but there is clearly something wrong in my head. i was completely oblivious to all the signals my girlfriend gave me. i was not empathetic and i was even mean to her, pushing her away. oddly enough, i love her deeply, more than anyone and anything, but for some reason i was not able to properly express that if i even did express it at all. i feel like there are two persons in my head: the one that feels, has dreams and ideas and wants to act on it vs. the one that is selfish, mean, negative and just keeps me from actually doing things. it feels like a constant battle in my head which is often own by the latter person.i suspect that many of my mental issues originate from my traumatic childhood. my parents divorced when i was 2, resulting in a long nast custody battle. i did not get to see my dad for 4 years because my mom had used me to get back at my dad by claiming he had sexually abused me which wasnt true. eventually, when i was 6 my mom died of cancer. i was never able to love my mom after knowing she used me and im actually glad she is dead. anyway, me and my two brothers then had to live with my dad, a man that was a stranger to me. money was tight, my dad became an alcoholic, and he was constantly fighting with my oldest brother. this went on for years. all my dads attention went towards my brothers and all he cared about with me were my school results. i got into a lot of trouble at school and with authorities in my youth. ever since i was 12 i have felt depressed, never able to feel really happy. i was suicidal and self-harming. at 18 i even tried to commit suicide, but luckily failed. all my life i have felt alone and unsupported until i met the girl who is now my ex. it was such a great relationship. we loved each other so much and things went almost perfect, rarely having a fight. i could not have imagined a better relationship. i was really happy with her. though sometimes i was still feeling down, unhappy or depressed']\n",

      "['my gf of almost 3 years broke up with me. we met online. she was 16 living in germany and i was 21 living in the netherlands. she initially invited me over to have fun, but we fell in love and decided for a long distance relationship (ldr). we had a near perfect ldr for 2,5 years. finally, in january this year she came to live with me. we were so happy. though things quickly turned bad. even though we were used to being together for long periods of time (2 month of constantly being together for example), it didnt work out the way we wanted. we both got full time jobs but with different time schedules. so we barely saw each other during the workweek. then in the weekends we failed to spend quality time together. she also didnt feel comfortable at home, because we lived with my dad. we were looking for our own place, but we had no luck. we didnt have big fights, just small fights that would increasingly frustrate us. due to my narcissistic behaviour, i pushed her away and took her for granted (i didnt recognize that at the time; didnt even realize i was a narcissist). she even gave me a second chance, but i failed to fix the issues since i didnt know what was wrong. besides all that, she is only 19 now and i was her first ever boyfriend. she had occasional thoughts of exploring and experimenting with other people, but she loved me so she wouldnt leave. though in the last few months in the relationship her love for me obviously faded and the single life became more attractive to her (also due to her new work/social environment). anyway, she broke up with me, saying she doesnt love me anymore; that she doesnt believe i can make her happy; that she cant commit to a lifelong relationship now; that she thinks we dont fit together in our core. i was shocked and heartbroken. i truly and deeply love her and i admit that i made a lot of mistakes in the last months of the relationship. i wish i could go back and do everything differently because i feel an enormous amount of guilt towards her. i also know that a lot of the mistakes i made come from my own emotional instability (e.g. narcissism). since the break up i have thought of her every day, i cried, i hurt myself, i even want to kill myself sometimes. i feel incredibly depressed']\n",

      "['my thoughts are warranted or if im being harsh.so i would say that recently (past few days) my depression has gotten much worse and i think i know why.ive never really been suicidal, ive wanted to stop living but i never wanted to kill myself. now the idea of suicide is comforting because i can 100% control weather i take my life or not and i dont have control of anything else in my life.anyway, im pretty open about being depressed with my close friend and for a while he has been pretty open about being depressed too. its kind of like were both struggling alone, with our own problems, but together.for a few months now we have had this \"joke\" between us that when it comes to being in a relationship, or getting with girls, that things just work out for him. and ive never thought too seriously about it until now.we both go to college together, but have different classes so we never see each other. but what made my depression much worse, i think, was this conversation. im going to say his name is jj for this, (its not).jj: so you know how we have that thing where, when it comes to girls, things just work out for me?me: yea.jj: well i was in class today and just said 1 stupid joke to a group i was assigned to for a project and this girl who i never talk to thought it was hilarious. she gave me her snap chat and was messaging me like crazy. then i recently got a message from her saying \"listen i want to be clear, i think your cute and i like you.\" now she wants me to come over and keeps telling me that her mom isnt home.boy did this piss me the fuck off. after i heard this i started comparing our lives and thought that my friend is a piece of shit for thinking hes depressed.this is the 3rd time that girls have fucking thrown themselves at him and because of this he has had sex multiple times and a 3 some because some random girl at a party walked in on them and fucking joined. another girl who threw herself at him was just sending very revealing picks out of nowhere. but yea hes fucking depressed. to add he has way to much money than he know what do do with despite working at the same fucking place. he is perusing an interesting and lucrative career through his education and tells me that he never even tries in college because he passes his classes with high as regardless.let me tell you a little about me. i make considerably less than him despite working at the same job. ive already failed an important class that contributes to my desired career path that im not even sure i want anymore. and i know for a fact that ill fail another class this semester, maybe 2 or 3. ive never been in a relationship or have even had any intimate contact with another girl. im going to counseling and can barely pay for it with my mothers help. i probably look like im about to shoot up the school when i go to classes with the way i dress and the constant expression on my face. not to mention my acne.after i heard this i cried in my room for about an hour. which is crazy because i usually numb myself instead of crying. or i get angry instead. but not this time. i cried a fucking ocean.yet he tells me that because of depression he has a loss of appetite and said he has gone down at least 4 waist sizes. i asked him and hes only ever cried once over one of the many girls that have thrown themselves at him.i dont know what the fuck you got but its not depression my guy, and the fact that you wont admit that angers me more than it should.i dont want to ruin our friendship but i just dont look at you the same and the thought of you irritates me.im sorry if im unclear in this post but im just very angry. however just writing out my thoughts makes me feel a bit better.tl;dr my friend has everything that i want in his life but claims to be depressed. i have nothing, and a conversation we had put me over the edge. because of this im more depressed']\n",

(i quitted cause i had a pain i my neck 1 week then i got anxiety after that and didn’t wanna go)anyway, so already yesterday when i got that message i felt depressed cause they know i don’t have any friends or anything and felt like the biggest loser. i also knew that once i got into that car all that he would talk about was “get a job”, “driver license is important” etc. like my grandma and my parents and everyone tells me daily. but i just said “yes let’s do it” cause i got nothing to lose so.so fast forward to today. i get in the car, we drive, he starts talk about how i should get a job and how i should get a drivers license. how i gotta start somewhere. who would’ve thought right.then once we get into the gym my dads gf daughter that works there starts talking with him and she’s 17. aka 3 years younger then me. she looks so adult’y. they keep a conversation and she does great. she talks about how she gonna go to the grocery store and work and stuff. while i’m just standing next to my dads brother cause i have social anxiety and have nothing to say. i just stand there and tell myself how i’m not normal.then when we payed we go in and start working out it goes pretty well, he learned me some new workout exercises. the ones i thought i did well turned out i did a lot of wrong. i know i should be happy that he could correct the issues. instead i felt like i’m not good at anything. something is always wrong. if i think i do something right it’s always wrong somehow.anyway, the workout went great, i didn’t feel very motivated more like “whatever, let’s just get over with it.” i tried being “happy” like put on my mask but i couldn’t barely even do that. i tried my best but pretty sure he saw right through me how sad i was. i’m also very insecure so i just talked quietly and said “i don’t know” when he asked me or told me to do a new exercise with him. i kept telling myself how boring i am atm. how he doesn’t actually enjoy it, cause how quite and insecure and “sad” i was. i just felt like a burden.one last thing was that i kept seeing all these guys my age that looks hot as fire, (i’m gay) and how they socialise like normal people and i just felt so disconnected from the world. i tried being happy and positive during this “adventure” but it was just so hard.now i’m home feeling a lot more depressed']\n",

      "['my life type of thing, you know? i loved her for a year or so, she rejected me all this time. had some suicide attempts during that (she knew of them, tried to talk me out of them, even wanted to help me and remain good friends), and had finally started to get it in my head that she didnt like me.  last weekend, after two nights of long, serious conversations with her (keep in mind, she was the closest person i had, no matter she didnt like me romantically. to my knowing, i am too, as she usually really keeps her feelings and experiences to herself and doesnt like change and stuff), we decided we had to end our pseudo-relationship. i guess i have to add in the fact that we had quite a bit of intimacy for a platonic relationship, not going into detail.  so, after the second serious conversation (both of these on chat, by the way), i was forced to make a decision: either to abandon our relations entirely, so i can focus on starting anew and pursuing other things rather than her (already had a girl in my sights, from the other class, shes pretty and seems nice), or continue our \"friendship\". i decided the latter.  well, i could spend a couple more sentences explaining why i did that, when i was, until that point, basically begging her not to end our thing we semi-had (yeah, she insisted on it first, even when saying she didnt want it, and was doing it for my happiness).  but, eh, i guess i had expected it, as our relationship had started to kinda go bad-ish in the last couple of weeks-days-idontevenknows.   so, yeah, i decided to end it. a couple days pass, us not talking to each other. i had started to get over it quickly, to my surprise, as, i guess, i was expecting this last conversation that we had that night for some time and i had prepared for it in advance. i dont really know why, but, no matter the reason, what matters is she texted me one night.  it was this wednesday, if you want to be specific. i was asleep during the time she sent the text, but i woke up at 1 am for some reason and saw it. she wanted to talk. i didnt really have an emotional reaction to that, didnt expect fucking anything.  so, the morning happens, schooln stuff, blablabla. i didnt really have any wish to talk to her, as i was kinda having a bad day... for the last couple of days. its hard dealing with this...\"break-up\" and having a depressing episode at the same time. maybe the latter was cause by the former, i dunno, i dont care. so, yeah, i dont talk to her during school hours. after that, i tell my friends to leave me go home for the day (i usually head for the bus stop with them, or even go on foot, going to a friends home, then heading to my sweet un), as i was kinda feeling depressed, and had myself open if she finally decided to catch up to me and talk to me.   which, of course, she did. and, whaddaya know, she tells me she loves me.   what the fuck?! - was my first reaction. it was.. what the fuck?! what the... how does.... why do.... what the fuck?!   ....fuck!   i love her. this is the best time for that snape flashback.    so, we had a little talk. we kissed, we cuddled. things are fine, you know? were together, were happy. im happy. i truly am, no sarcasm intended. i love her, it isnt a lie. so were together for these couple of days, were together now. we send eachother cute little emojis. kisses, hearts, that kind of stuff, you know? its really cute, i love it. shes a cutie. but... it feels.... it feels lackluster.   how do i express this? i dont even know how. i guess... it kinda feels like a dream come true, but... after that dream was replaced by another and let to waste. i wanted to start anew. it felt like it, you know? i had started to gather the courage to talk to that other girl ive been eyeing, before current gf comes and talks to me. i had started to be content with myself, starting to appreciate other aspects of life, as i was obsessed with this girl, texted daynnite, abandoned plans just to go out with her, that sort of thing. when we separated, i felt... kind of free. i dont know. i honestly dont.    its 3:50 right now, took me exactly 40 minutes to write down this story. excuse gramatical mistakes and stuff like that.   well, i hope you got a bit of entertainment out of that. cause this isnt the nitty gritty of the post. its just a fraction of the reason i wrote it.   3:52. right now, i have this fantasy scenario thingy. i wish to run away. you know? just to abandon all my friendships, all relationships, all family, and go out into the world alone. i love martial arts. maybe i can go to shaolin, learn a bit of kung fu or some stuff like that. why? i feel like im a fucking burden. my friends, my family, my now-gf. i feel like theyre burdened with me. with the every-other-day depressive episode. i call it a \"bad day\". decided to stray away from calling it what it is unless its really serious, but 99% of the time its fucking depression. its killing me. i got taken by the police one night, drunkie me had decided to jump off a bridge after downing a bottle of vodka after i got in a fight with nowgf. i talked to her before my planned jump. biggest meltdown of my life. whatever. other suicide attempts, people dont know about. i dont even know sometimes, what qualifies as an attempt. is it just not being careful when crossing the street, on purpose? is it punching the wall out of anger when taking a shower and/or crying? is it being a little too confident around some people, realising you could get in trouble for that fight you could cause, and the consequences can depress you so much, you can ruin your life? not everytime its literal suicide, you know? sometimes, i just wanna kill something inside me. dont even know what.   i am really sorry if this has gotten really confusing for you. lemme do a quick recap for ya:tl;dr:theres this girl. love her. after a year of self-caused torture and suicide attempts while trying to win her over, and serious conversation where she decides we should end what we have, we separate. couple days pass, we talk, she tells me she loves me. now in a relationship. i wanna die. i wanna run away. start anew. i hate myself. i hate my depression']\n",

(also, went no contact with what i thought was the love of my life. its the right move but it definitely stung. fuck last week)2am this morning my monday starts. just as aggressive as last week. my grandmother frail and wobbling, is tottering around the tile kitchen, with a dying flashlight \"getting some food\" kay........ my mom puts her angry ass to bed. we all go back to bed, sorta. 6am, shes using a dirty dish to put fruit in. mom tells her that she took a dish from the dirty side of the sink( left) rather than the clean rack (right) grandma exploded with the usual. \"i cant do anything right, all you do is yell at me, i might as well be dead i cant do anything right by you!!\" mom does what she can before work, and i tag in.i explain ( for the millionth time- and yes i know i should be more empathic for her memory, but for fucks sake im so sick of this same circular argument) that we are here to make sure youre safe and healthy. while i cant force you to exercise and get your strength back, but i can make sure youre clean and relatively safe.shes. not. having. it.(and frankly, i totally get that too, i dont even believe my own bullshit after this long)*more verbal abuse*\"you should be ashamed of yourself\"\"youre mentally beating me\"\"you need to get a job\"and finally her #1 hit... \"im going to kill myself!\"i was already aware of my burn out. i have my \"mental health toolbox\" thanks to therapy, medication and consistent introspection, and ive been ignoring it in favor of my bed and making my dogs snuggle me. full depression burrito mode, even though my list of stuff to do is just getting longer and longer, im beat.i told her last week when she did this, i would follow her down that bunny hole if she wanted to go out that way. doesnt matter to me lady. she just glared at me, while i berated myself for being the worst caregiver, and for taking the bait. i know better.the weekend i laid low. tried to reset myself again.this morning... i lost my cool. mid rant ( lots of those happening in this house today 🙄) she said it again, \"i might as well be dead!!!\"\"...ya know what? go ahead. neither of us want to be here, and quite frankly, taking a swan dive off the roof sounds like the best way to end this.\"the words were out of my mouth and so true. i scared myself. she didnt see it, she just continued with her refrain... im too bossy, she never acted this way with her mother when she was older, i should be ashamed, she doesnt want to live anymore bc there is no point.. which is fine by me, im not trying to scare my grandmother, but both our lack of value with our lives is... worrying. if she threatens again, im calling the police station, she may not take suicide threats seriously, but i sure the fuck do.jumping off things was never a method or a plan i made before. sometimes, when i would find a \"right\" high spot, the thought would hold me for a bit longer than comfortable, but i usually dismissed it. probably would hurt. but now im kinda fixated. it is a two story, a proper dive would probably do the trick... and as ive gotten older physical pain scares me less and less. id just need to fall on my head, i could manage that...but thats when i \"look\" at my toolbox and its like \"what about your mom?\" \"what about your dog?\" my bff is amazing and strong, shed be okay. probably not mom or dad though.anyway, thanks for reading this rant. depression']\n",

      "['my history. i was diagnosed years ago at maybe 20 with something called avoidant personality disorder along with major depression. it basically makes me extremely shy, anxious in social situations, super self-critical, highly fearful of social rejection, and generally just sadness that cannot be lifted. ive dealt with this my whole life: i had my mother pay for stuff for me when i was young, refused to order through a drive-thru, buy gas, etc. im not near that bad anymore, but still im extremely cautious and anxious in social situations.&#x200b;on the other hand, i am extremely nice if you get to know me. i dont want anybody to feel the pains that i do, so i try my best to be ultra friendly, helpful, and lift your mood. i love to joke and make people smile. so on the outside, you cannot see my inner frustrations and the complex thoughts running through my mind. the only thing running through my mind is how terribly the people i talk with are viewing me. my goal is to make you happy and not see the pain i feel and ive had a lifetime of practice.&#x200b;im also extremely intelligent. in middle school/high school, i took part in something called gifted and talented. there were only a handful of us coming from two rural school districts. i won presidential awards and was in the top 10% ranked in the us for scores. i had a 4.0 gpa in college but had to drop out because i ran out of funding. i really dont want to brag, so please dont take it that way... well, theres an example of me analyzing myself again, and fearful of rejection. its pretty much what runs through my mind constantly. when i speak to you or listen, im not really focused on what im saying but how im being viewed.&#x200b;anyway, at a young age i became attached to technology right around the 90s. i taught myself touch typing somewhere around 11 and was around 45 wpm in high school. im at about 80 now, give or take. i loved getting on bbss and ending up installing linux somewhere around the windows 95 era. i was an irc operator for a linux help channel and became a bit of a script kiddie. i would crash or bluescreen my friends windows computers, spoof ips in irc (go into a warez channel with like a .gov address, it was fun!), smurf, and so forth. technology just came second nature to me.&#x200b;i only had a couple of friends, obviously, but one of them got me into drugs. ive done loads and loads of drugs most havent even heard of and it eventually got me kicked out of school for bringing ghb with me one day. my parents moved me to a christian alternative school where i blew through the coursework usually in half a day and i could just leave early, so thats what i did and worked the other half in a computer shop. im an atheist by the way, so that school was pretty much garbage for me. at work, i started building a website for my boss in a few languages with a shopping cart and everything; sql, coldfusion, html, blah blah. i was maybe 16 at the time.&#x200b;drugs eventually got the best of me and i ended up ruining everything. drugs were the only thing that made me feel functional in society or a sense of normalcy.&#x200b;i eventually met my wife, we had kids, and for the most part the drugs stopped, but the drinking really started to pick up. its been at least a few years since ive done a drug other than the very rare occasion of pot with an old friend. drinking has caused a ton of problems obviously.&#x200b;ive been to many psychiatrists and anti-depressants never work. they never prescribe anything for anxiety and im told theres really nothing you can do to treat a disorder other than counseling and so forth. but theres the kicker, i cannot really open up to a counselor and i lie and tell them everything is ok every single time just to get the hell out of there.&#x200b;ive attempted suicide once by overdose but my wife got me to the er just in time. ive spent a few times in mental hospitals because it just always becomes unbearable, get on some anti-depressants']\n",

      "['my dog, a weimaraner, had been going down hill lately. she was 12-13, and had lost a significant amount of weight. and i had finally come around to acknowledging that it was time. when i first got her she was basically my antidepressant. she kept me going when i didn’t want to get out of bed or wouldn’t eat. i took her to a vet who recommended putting her down. in my upset denial. i made an appointment with another vet, but also to put her down if he said the same thing. second opinion and all. her appointment was wednesday. i tell my boyfriend about all this. he says he will support me in whatever i do. tuesday night rolls around and we go out to a bar for a bit to let off steam and get out of the house for a bit. just knowing what i had to do the next day was sending me into ugly oprah cry a lot. he gets belligerently drunk and starts telling me that he doesn’t think it’s time for my dog. and that i just need to work harder at it because it’s what happens when dogs get older. he also said the reason why she was how she was is because she was reacting to my negative energy. so i being an emotional wreck as it was, start crying at the bar, in front of his friends and a few of mine. cue my boyfriend hysterically laughing at me for crying. at that point i pay our $30 tab and his roommate drives him back to their house as i wasn’t about to have him come to mine in that state. i needed him that night. i needed him to comfort me. and instead he chose to be a drunk, stupid, asshole. the next morning, wednesday morning, i’m up. cradling my baby, trying not to be upset in front of her because i don’t want her to get bothered that i’m upset. i’m trying to find a dog friendly patio to get her a burger for her last meal.  he starts texting. he doesn’t remember what happened. do i still want him to go with me that day. i said after last night, no. and he asked if we were over. it was all too much. i really needed him to just fuck off but he wouldn’t take no for an answer and said if i wasn’t breaking up with him, that he was coming to her stuff. so i find a puppy friendly patio. her and i head down there. he meets us and there’s not much talking going on. i am not ready to rehash the events and bullshit of the night before. my attentions and thoughts needed to be on my baby. so we go, vet says without doing expensive blood tests and such that he would guess it’s a severe cancer. she had lost about 50 pounds in 16 months, which was about half her body weight. he said her quality of life was not very good at this point. cue insufferable guilt. why had i let it get that way? i should have seen that it was time before, but i just couldn’t be without her. she was probably the only reason why i had made it through the last decade, and i just wanted her with me.  she was still so strong, would pull on her leash and what not, and was still eating and shitting like a champ. so i just kept hanging on. so i make the decision and killed my best friend. and i honestly wanted to just die along with her. cue devastation. cue all the terrible thoughts. my boyfriend spent ten mins outside the clinic holding me as i hysterically cried. and then he said he had to go back home to sleep because he works nights. and i was definitely disappointed. i felt he let me down again. so i went to my parents’ and continued to hysterically ugly oprah cry and break down. things finally calmed a little. some friends of his asked if i wanted to go out that night and since i didn’t want to go home to my empty house i once shared with her, or be alone, i went. and they asked how everything went after they had seen my boyfriend’s antics on tuesday night. i filled them in and his own friends said that i had been the only one putting in effort in a while, and that i don’t deserve the way he treats me, and that him failing me in my time of need should be the last straw. and like me holding onto her, i had probably been doing the same with him. so i decide he and i very seriously need to talk. thursday morning, after he gets off work at 9am i go to his place. i didn’t pack all his things from my house to take over because i was genuinely interested in talking to see if we could work things out. i asked him why we should be together. he said because he loves me. it’s not enough to just say it, i need to see it, and feel it. he says that he isn’t happy. he knows i’m not happy. so what else do we try to change it? he has no suggestions. just a lot of “i don’t know”.so i end things. if you can’t tell me why we should be together or what i bring to your life as your girlfriend, what’s the point?so i get my things and i go. tell him i’ll get him his things when i get a chance. he says i hope you know, i really do love you. i told him, i know he does, but i need to feel it. i need to know that in more than just words. we talk more, and i tell him i’m willing to give him a chance to win me back to show me he means what he says. and now it’s been days of back and forth. so who knows where that will be.  in the meantime i’ve been doing all i can not to be home. when i’m home the house is empty. there is no joy. when i open the door there isn’t a little nose and a wagging tail coming to love me. when i get up, i don’t need to get out of bed to let her out and feed her. when i’m sleeping there isn’t a cuddle buddy chasing rabbits in her dreams next to me. and it’s crushing me. last night i was finally able to drag her beds into my empty bedroom. i still haven’t been able to really touch her things. i haven’t been able to get past the guilt that i kept her in suffering because i selfishly didn’t want to let her go. before i had to put her down, i told him i was scared of the depression']\n",

      "['my friend for a casual smoke sesh yesterday around lunch, it was all going well, we each had a few bongs hits and after aboout 3 minutes the euphoria set in, i felt amazing. keep in mind i have severe social anxiety so weed really helps in these types of situations.. or so i thought. after 15 or so minutes and half a bowl later i asked her if she wanted to watch a movie with me to which she agreed, i let her choose to be nice. we decide to go inside and pick a movie together, this is when it all goes to shit. she then asks me what i want to watch but since i really wasnt phased i told her to put on anything. i mainly just wanted to spend time with her, i didnt care what we were doing exactly. during the process of her choosing the film, i started to get insanely paranoid for no reason, and yeah i know weed can do this but it never happened before. so i said to myself that it would be over soon and just to chill the fuck out, i was calming down a little until i heard her say \"god your so boring\" under her breathe. now it may have just been the drug but it literally felt like my heart had been ripped out and crushed by a boulder after that, since i have feelings for her and im pretty sure she knows it. i was numb but tried to act normal (something im not very good at) and told her i needed to use the toilet. after i come back out i realize she finally decided on what to watch, something we both liked. a little later on i could really feel the tension between us and we didnt really say much during the movie. midway through i thought fuck it and tried to make a move, i put my arm around her and moved in a little closer, it felt like my heart was going 180bpm but i held it together as best i could. she seemed pretty relaxed so i tell her how amazing she is and that i love everything about her (i know stupid) she looks and me, i look at her, i ask if its ok to kiss her to which she says no. she tells me she wants to remain friends and that shes had enough trouble with guys, (a few of them have fucked her over). i said that it was ok but the look on my face said i wasnt, i didnt want to make her feel uncomfortable but i felt it was already too late for that. i felt terrible, i feel like i ruined our friendship. i dont know if i can talk to her the same way again. its all my fault and knew it would never happen since i have literally zero confidence, but did it anyway for some stupid reason. i really like her but i think its best if we dont talk for a while and let things settle but ive been thinking about it all day and its the worst pain ive ever fucking felt, worse than my grandpa dying, im a failure. we both struggle with depression']\n",

(5 hours a week if you wonder)on top of that comes the fact that i feel less and less capable of emotions. (the 4 to 5 hours a week i can spend with my friens during lunch break are an exception where i laugh and all) i even realised that i cant cry for some reason. we watched a schindlers list in cinematography class and i was internally really sad and tears started coming, but they always go back inside. im also terrified of talking to people i dont know well. so losing the onefirend mentionned later really hits me. that makes it hard just in general when the class you´re in wants to be a \"lets all be friends\" class. especially when the girl you think is really cute is in your class. im scared of other peoples judgement and of the possibilty to be stuck in an awkward situation during conversations so i flee them to begin with. i dont think i have a serious depression']\n",

(didnt happen). but the only time ive felt happy in years was with that girl because we also cuddled and she acted like a girlfriend and thats the only time a girls shown me that interest.anyways, besides that i dont really have many  female friends, theres a few in my life but i never ask women to hang out one on one unless im trying to see them as potential dates. most women i meet if i hear they have a boyfriend i just naturally end up not really talking to them, it makes me depressed because i isolate myself but i do most things out of selfish intention. i hear people say sex doesnt matter or having a relationship isnt a big deal but when you live in a house with two couples and youre the only one alone, or when youre with friends and they constantly talk about the guys/girls theyve hooked up with or relationship stuff i cannot relate. i feel like i cant relate to most people. im constantly wanting to go to bars and clubs just to try to get more confident and work on talking to women because i suck at it. ive spent thousands on escorts and massage parlors and cant stop. im losing a ton of money but i have no other real hobbies except martial arts or weight lifting. i probably creep out women too because ive hit on one girl in my friend group and these other girls pulled her away from me. in short, just started therapy and anti depressants, i mainly talk about stressing about school but the thing that makes me lay in bed all day is loneliness and im sexually frustrated. im scared to admit that to my therapist. even mentioning it on here because i sound like some fucking incel but thats how i see it right now. besides exercise, eating semi healthy and incorporating meditation most my life is going in the shitter and im constantly partying and finding ways to not feel lonely and its costing me money, my grades and everything. i know i need therapy for this but im insanely scared of admitting it because its such a petty thing to have depression']\n",

      "['my friends and having to start all over again completely fucked me up. i have never been more anxious and afraid my entire life. few weeks go by and im drinking like a goddamn sailor every thursday-sunday. it’s nice because my anxiety drops while drinking (obviously) but it doubles the next day. then after a little while i notice i have a lack of motivation for just about everything in my life. i find myself grasping at old triumphs and happy times of the past and it’s reassuring in the moment but counter intuitive because i cant just “go back.” at this point i feel stuck. everyday is just constant hell and i fake my way through it pretending to be alright so i don’t scare off all these new people i want to be friends with. luckily, im a damn good actor and nobody can definitively tell. a few more weeks go by and i decide to get psychiatric help since it’s free at my school (at least the therapy part is, not the drugs). i start seeing a therapist once a week and im prescribed anti-anxiety and anti-depressant pills. when i say these are a god-send im not putting that lightly. when i told my mom i was doing this she said she hadn’t heard me that ecstatic in over a month and a half. they don’t work right away but the sheer comfort of having them in my possession immediately relieved symptoms. now i’m about a month and a half in to taking these drugs and they still are doing wonders, but they are not without issue. i stopped taking the anti-anxiety meds because they were prescribed on an as needed basis and my college anxiety dropped significantly so they just frankly weren’t necessary at a certain point. so this is a 100% focus on the anti-depressants, specifically fluoxetine with a 25mg dose. ive started to notice that my general emotional state doesn’t feel entirely myself. it’s like someone is pulling my strings like a puppet to make me smile. it’s great sometimes because i probably wouldn’t feel good otherwise but it’s robbed me of the ability to fully feel negative emotions. do i prefer it to the depression? of course. but i guess the issue is more of my lack of understanding of the drug prior to usage. i thought that it would make me “feel normal.” it gets damn well close but it’s phony and i know it is. i desperately want to ween myself off the drugs but i fear i may be developing a dependency and im worried about the me that lives on the other side of my happy pills.also there’s 1 more side effect that is super shitty. climaxing is a bitch now, an absolute bitch. it’s nearly impossible and will probably take an hour. i literally get to the point where i tire out my partners and i feel kind of embarassed. then they get self-conscious because they think they’re not turning me on enough. it’s a whole thing and goddamn is it frustrating. i have to tell them usually that im on anti-depressants and i hate telling people im depressed']\n",

      "['my last semester of my undergraduate, i’ve been in college for 7 years now only because i did community college for 2 years and my major was not offered there. anyways i was pursuing a double degree in earth and planetary science and math and things started to look up for me and loved how everyone seemed proud of me and my struggling times are finally behind me. before i get to my story, i have had an anxiety disorder my senior year of high school and 3 years of college. went away when i got a job with a cameraman for the school and local sports back in 2014. i also don’t have many friends and have been single most of my life. so back to the storyone of my dreams as a kid grow in up was to study weather. i’ve always wanted to be a weather man. and i just loved weather in general being a kid and growing up. i wanted to go to a school that taught those classes and hope to make it! unfortunately due to not doing so well in high school and where i live, that option was not available in my state, so i ended up going to a community college due to poor grades and since it was cheaper. after a year and a half i transferred over to the university here and found out meteorology wasn’t available, so i did the next closest thing which was earth and planetary science. it’s mostly geology but i dislike geology very much. a bit disappointed but as someone with a family that struggles financially, i had to settle here. life was tough in my early college years, i set my bar high to pass my classes but i always ended up with c’s and maybe a class i didn’t pass, which is why i took longer. having horrible anxiety being in class made it difficult to learn. but i marched on. whenever i didn’t pass a class, i tried again next semester and end up passing it. my gpa was always around 2.5 the whole way through, so i’m what you call a below average joe, everyone in my field has above a 3.0 except for me. although when i got a job and started interacting with more people and working in another department (communications) i built confidence and my anxiety slowly faded which allowed me to focus better in class, i saw my grades improving and i’ve noticed i’m doing well in calculus so i decided to add a math minor to go along with my degree. along with my confidence building, last year i had the guts to ask my friend out and she said yes and she became my girlfriend and life was continuing looking upward, no depression, and life was good. to continue on with the life looking upward, i decided to add math as my major so that put me to pursuing two degrees and i felt great! i knew what i wanted, i knew what i wanted to achieve in life, i saw my path clear as day, i had this in the bag!my school finally offered a meteorology class in the spring 2018 semester and was taught by a professor who used to work at the national weather service. i continuously began talking to her throughout class and definitely showed my interest and performed to the best of my ability in class. got a b+ but her class was generally on the more difficult side. since i did show a lot of effort she even offered me a visit to the national weather service in june. truly a dream come true, i was at a loss for words! i spoke with everyone there, got a tour of the place, they showed me how the instrumentations worked and i was even offered a volunteer opportunity with them. all i had to do was fill out the application and follow normal procedures. in june, i also got a new job as a supervisor and to me it paid better than the camera man job but i still do both. i was going to start saving up so i can move out of my parents place and start life, apply to grad school so i can earn my masters as well. then, the new job started a bit too fast paced and it was difficult to keep up at some point, but that’s okay, a new job can always be a hassle. but it did put me in some stress but i didn’t mind, the pay was nice and couldn’t complain at all. i was taking summer school but i understood the material. i ended up passing my class with a b which allowed me to get my eps degree, though still working on the math. and i finally submitted my application to the national weather service.they did say it’ll take a few days for the application viewing, so about that time i submitted it i started school, and being confident in my math skills i signed up for 4 math classes and because of the school financial aid, i can’t fall below less than 2.0 and pass all of my classes with a c or better. i felt prepared since i was doing so well, and i had to graduate by spring 2019.first week of class i fell behind and struggled dearly to where i can still drop a class without it being in my grades. i started to study and study and i couldn’t learn the material, like i hit a learning wall. i couldn’t learn new stuff anymore.       i got so frustrated with the homework i didn’t do it, i even went to get help from the professor and i just couldn’t learn it from them. what led up to not doing homework ended up to just not going to class. i went to my advisor to downgrade my math major back to a minor so no matter the outcome of the semester i can graduate this fall. i then found out i need just 1 more math class to get the minor. but i’m struggling hard in every class that i just can’t do it. to make this story bad, i never heard back from the national weather service. i feel like my application got denied and with the failing semester and poor grades, i won’t get into graduate school, i was going to study meteorology with it since it’s not offered here. it’s like my life fell apart in a short month. i feel like i lost everything and i can’t pick myself back up anymore. i can’t push through this final semester, i’m down and out for the count. it’s like everyone was proud of me for what i’ve been doing, everyone was happy for me, i’ve let everyone down. ive let my girlfriend down since she’s been helping me but i’ve been pushing her away. she’s telling me to seek help and it’s so difficult to reach out. i’m losing everyone around me. i’m losing everything. i’ve lost my dream and i feel like i don’t have a future anymore. i’m trying to attempt my hw and going to class but i just don’t want to do it or go to class anymore.i don’t know what i want anymore, i don’t know if this is the right place to talk about this but i just need someone to listen to me. tl;dr: what seemed like a clear path in my life with my earth and planetary science and mathematics degree, getting a volunteer opportunity with my dream job, the national weather service, and hoping to go to grad school and getting my masters in meteorology, turned out to be crushing as i cant learn anymore, i won’t get the math degree, or even the minor, never heard back from the national weather service, i won’t even get into grad school, i have no future at all anymore. and it’s making me depressed']\n",

could i then free myself of this self-imposed exile of not talking to her? what if i reach out in 2021? 2022? i could make a good faith effort to reach out again after i had completed treatment, right?? i knew i couldnt repeat the same mistakes i committed before.i decided to reach out to her before 2021, but only after consulting with my girlfriends and r/askwomenadvice. i had already completed some therapy, and i felt that i could probably make a good faith effort to reach out and ask for a second chance. i asked politely if she wanted to catch up, and perhaps even go on a date after she was comfortable, but she politely declined. i respected her decision, and wished her a merry christmas and a happy 2019. i left the conversation at that, and i dont plan on ever returning to it. i felt overjoyed, even if the answer wasnt quite what i wanted to hear. i had finally gotten the closure i needed.i could move on with my life instead of wondering \"when the fuck will i get better enough to reach out to her??\" in 2016, my answer to \"when will i get better to reach out to her\" was a resounding \"never, youre fucked in the head, brah, leave her out of your pathetic and miserable life lol\" in 2018, after getting my diagnoses, my answer was \"maybe after you finish the 18-36 months of therapy.\" after asking around, my answer became \"reach out to her now since youve completed some therapy, and get ready to accept whatever answer comes your way.\"i never felt so genuinely happy to hear from her after 2.5 years of radio silence. even though the answer was \"no, im not interested in you on any level,\" i was overjoyed. i needed that to \"hear\" her voice again. and i needed that closure. i could finally close that chapter of my life and move on with my life without wondering \"what if...she misses me?\" i sincerely wished her well and left the conversation at that. the conversation will probably stay at that for the rest of our lives, and im okay with that. i want her to be happy, even if that doesnt involve me. i knew i had blown my chance way back in 2014, and i wasnt going to beg her for a chance. ask politely once, yes, but beg? i never begged before, and i wasnt about to start. i wasnt going to guilt-trip her either with some bullshit like \"i need you in my life, you are my oxygen, im going to be depressed']\n",

(i have never gone outside of the northern countries for a vacation, so this is the first time in my life that i got to see an exotic place)  absolutely amazing job, met a lot of new friends, also met my current girlfriend.i lost both of my grandmothers to old age and a friend who was found dead in the woods outside of my old city. i never got to be on either of their funerals, neither did i meet or talk to them for a long time prior to their deaths.  ive had some episodes of depression, which, luckily for me, i had my friends and my girlfriend to cheer me up.   but these feelings got out of hand one day after a fight with my girlfriend, whereas i tried ending my life by some pills. i cant recall these pills, but they didnt work. i woke up at the hospital, then they put me in mental care for 3 days. got back to the hotel where i worked, got fired. basically my boss ended my contract, so i wasnt actually fired per-say. but still fired. i came home to sweden, sought up a psychiatrist, talked for 2 months.im still together with my girlfriend, but she lives in another country, so we cant meet as often as wed like. this causes us to doubt in our relationship due to this long distance.  2 days ago my little brother hanged himself, and no one notified me about this. i discovered it by myself from my stepmoms facebook page. aaaaand, i missed the funeral.  i will also be spending this christmas alone, with the only person i cherish and care for 1000km away from me.  this year ive lost 3 relatives and a friend. gained loads of friend and a bestfriend/lover.  am i still depressed']\n",

      "['my friends that i wanted to end my life. that’s how serious it was at the time.  i cant stop thinking about my job of two years that i left in the winter time. i stayed there as long as i did because it was convenient to get to  and my school schedule fit well with the job. the work was pretty easy. i feel like the more that i talk about it the more i get mad again over situations that i had been in but at the same time i need to talk about it to the people who are trying to help me get better because they will know the root of my depression. there had been an investigation for three months before i left in december 20th. a supervisor went around to my coworkers for one on ones where she would ask us questions like how long have you been here, how do you like working here and what kind of suggestions do you have for our menu. by the time that i actually got to talk to her she has talked to everyone in my store and this made me sad because i did not feel apart of the team. for whatever meeting that we had i was always the last one and this made me feel unimportant. i always had to ask when my meeting would be and be on top of the people who i was supposed to have meetings with whether it be for a performance review or a meeting for an interview. i caught the person who was supposed to have my meeting with on a day that i wasnt scheduled to work, i had been filling in for someone during that day. i had been trying to get ahold of her for weeks and was pretty disappointed that she had neglected to meet with me until i stepped in on 12/20 when she tried running out of the store.  when  my district manager finally asked me how do i like working here i lost it. i told her that i was miserable because there was drama everyday. she had asked me who is creating all of this drama and i said that i didnt know because it seemed like everyone had their own share in creating drama. she mentioned that she has no tolerance for drama.  i mentioned two coworkers that have been doing nothing but flirting making everyone else pick up the slack for them. this was pretty irritating. we had talked to them several times about how they werent doing anything but nothing ever changed. one day i just told me general manager that i could no longer work with them. i had suggested that i not work a certain day that they were working and that i start coming in earlier on my other days that they were not working in order to make up for the loss hours. my general manager dismissed my concerns for other coworkers and lied to me saying that she could no grant my wish because she was understaffed when in fact she wasnt understaffed. why she did not say we should all have a meeting together to discuss my concerns i dont know. i brought this up during my one on one with my supervisor. my general manager was later asked about whether or not this conversation really happened and she denied that we spoke about it. it was then when i went from miserable to pissed off. i brought this up with my supervisor and she got pretty mad that i did not talk to my general manager after she denied that i talked to her about not closing with several of my coworkers. my supervisor told me that i make everything so complicated and proceeded to lecture me on what three things i need to do in order to be successful working there. she quizzed me on what the three things were and me not being in my state of mind did not answer correctly. i believe that she used this quiz to take the pressure off of her and throw me off. after i got her question wrong she then transitioned to asking me what my schedule was. i was on winter break so i gave her my winter break schedule and then she asked what was my school schedule. she later told me that something would happen next week before i worked next. i did not make it to my next working day. i met with her a second time, this time at a coffee shop after i had begged her for a second meeting. i lost it that christmas day.  i did not hear back from her after getting my phone called forwarded and after leaving a voicemail early in the morning. i stayed up late talking to one of my managers about my supervisors lack of response. my supervisor had texted me at 5pm asking me if everything was okay but that was the last i heard of her that day. i texted her at 10pm pleading her to please answer. since my first meeting with her i was immediately sick to my stomach, not able to sleep, eat, or function throughout the day. i had discussed problems with the store that had been bothering me since i first started working there. i did not speak about it until i had the platform because i was scared of retaliation from my general manager. my general manager had a history of doing people dirty who did not follow her way, often removing people from the schedule completely without notifying the person she took off.what went on in the second meeting that i had with my supervisor i cant remember completely, but even if i did remember most of it, it is too long to write about.  i first got there and i bring a water bottle and she asks me if i paid for it and i told her yes. she continued to ask me if i bought it because she did not see me walking in, just me grabbing  a water bottle. she told me that she would pay for it but i again told her that i had already paid. i bought the water because i am not a big coffee person. she was on her computer at the time that i walked in. as soon as i sat down she had told me that i worried her the night before when i begged her to pick up the phone. she had told me that she didnt know what to do because i mentioned her that i couldnt work with three people in the store, one of them including my general manager. i suggested that she should transfer my general manager but my supervisor was pretty firm on keeping her no matter what i said. by the last time that she told me that she didnt know what to do i threw my hands up in the air and said i dont know what to say either. before i could finish my sentence she has asked me if i wanted to take a month off. she did not give me any explanation for this but i took on her offer because i was desperate to get out at the time and i took it without any hesitation. she asked me if i wanted to take february off and i told her that i preferred to take january off because i am already taking time off because of a trip that i had planned out in advance. these last couple of meetings left me completely broken. even though my supervisor did not talk much or say anything wrong i did not come back the same after these two meetings and i am still broken almost a year afterwards. i think about it all the time. multiple therapists, family members and friends have warned me to never go back but the peacemaker in me wants to go back and make everyone happy. at this job,  i didnt have anybody yelling at me all the time like i did with all of my jobs after this smoothie place. with all of the jobs that i have had since then i have been getting yelled at a lot and it damages my self-esteem and ultimately triggers my depression. im sick of getting yelled at all of the time. i liked this smoothie job so much because it was convenient for me. it was convenient for me to get there, it was easy money, and i was comfortable there. i am no longer there because the place was full of drama with everyone fighting each other and it really affected my mental health eventually causing me to have a full mental breakdown. it wasnt until i had one conversation with my supervisor where all of my problems with the store came out from a place that i had stored in a far away place. since my conversation with this supervisor i have been super depressed']\n",

      "['myself and i want to die\" stage. i used to be really depressed and suicidal but now im rather numb. not happy, not sad, just numb.but theres still this lingering feeling of regret because ive changed. i get it, change is normal isnt it? we cant stay the same way forever. however, we should change in ways that make us grow and feel better about ourselves, not into someone we hate. i currently hate the guts out of my current personality. i dont know how i got to this point but im such a boring person nowadays. where do i even begin?i used to be a happy, outgoing and passionate person. nowadays i dont really have any passions anymore. this is bothering me more than anything. ive also grown apart from things that made me feel like me, things that made me have a strong sense of self and individuality. random example: music. i used to listen to good music (or at least thats my personal opinion). nowadays, im really frustrated by the fact that i genuinely cant enjoy good music anymore. my brain now prefers catchy, superficial and and boring songs that i never thought id listen. i used to listen to music because i could relate to the lyrics, i could relate to the singer and the message in the music. nowadays, i pretty much listen to all kinds of crap that have the same lyrics repeat all over again. i cant appreciate good things anymore.im also extremely moody and picky. i used to be happy with my life and not expect much from anyone. nowadays, i feel crushed if i have an argument with my mother; if i fail at something, i feel defeated. i no longer go out and take long walks under the moon. i used to really like nature and engage in lots of activities out in nature. nowadays it doesnt really interest me anymore. &nbsp;overall, ive changed from being a deep, thoughtful, meditative person into a very shallow person without any strong views and opinions. i just hate the fact that im so superficial and numb towards everything. i can no longer empathize with people the way i used to. i used to really feel sorry for everyone and i felt like my empathy was making me a good person. nowadays i cant really empathize with anyone, moreover than that, im very quick to judge. this just doesnt feel like me.as a conclusion, to sum up everything: ive become shallow and boring, i no longer see value in things that are genuinely valuable and instead, im just wasting my spare time on superficial things that dont really bring me any emotional reward. theres nothing that i genuinely like or believe in anymore. im not funny anymore and i dont feel like joking the way i used to.i know people will say that im depressed and that i dont need to be sad all the time in order to be depressed. i dont think thats the case. in fact, i have moments when i can feel quite content, even though i havent felt blissfully happy in a while. also, ive been depressed before and i know what depression feels like, so i can safely assume that im not depressed at the moment. im just...not the genuine me anymore. i feel like a different person, if that makes sense. i feel like my past trauma changed me into a different person and i can no longer relate to the past me. however, i despise the changes and dont know what to do to feel like myself again. i dont feel depressed']\n",

      "['my life**&nbsp;ive come to the conclusion that i dont want to live anymore. i dont have the motivation to do anything anymore. i just dont want to. ive always hated my family. i hate my friends, my colleagues, and everyone else. good and genuine people are so rare nowadays its damn difficult to meet one of those in a lifetime. everyone else is fake, ignorant and uneducated. living in a shithole of a country doesnt help much either. people here would do anything to make you feel like shit. most of them are pretty stupid and stubborn and they think theyre always right. here, in my country, people think that mental illness is a choice. you can just snap out of it whenever you want to, simple as that. happiness is a choice, they say. if you see a psychiatrist, they think youre legitimately insane. they are like sheep. everything you do disrespects god. homosexuals should burn in hell because the bible says so. those who dont believe in god should also burn in hell because the bible says so. meanwhile, those religious assholes think theyre all holy and pure, when basically, theyre the worst kind of people. theyre ignorant and uneducated and no matter what happens, it happens because of gods will. living in a christian, orthodox family, taught me that i should avoid this kind of people at all costs.&nbsp;just a few days ago, we were discussing a few recent events in my country. there has been a terrible car crash and 9 people died in it. my father was saying, unironically, that they deserved to die because they were trash and they were goddamn gypsies who dont deserve to live. hes said stupid shit like this on other occasions too. whenever someone brings up the topic of gay people, he would curse them and tell me that if he ever finds out that im gay (im not) or that im hanging out with gay people, he will cut me off completely and never talk to me again. he hates everyone who is different or doesnt agree with his views, and i fucking despise him for that. i cant stand the fact that i have a racist and homophobic father.&nbsp;on top of that, my current mental state doesnt allow me to cope with all this bullshit. im fed up with everything and everyone. i should be writing my thesis right now but instead, im stuck here thinking about how much i hate my country and people, in general. ive been suffering from depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, depersonalization/derealization and ocd (pure-o) for years and its getting more and more difficult for me to deal with my environment and with myself. during these years, ive been trying various tratments and pills but nothing ever worked. also, ive been in therapy for years, sometimes changing therapists in order to see if someone will be able to shed some light on my situation. i know that therapy helps some people but it personally doesnt help me. seeing that nothing makes me feel better, naturally, i turned to drugs. ive never done hard drugs like heroin, coke or meth, but i sometimes mess around with mdma, dxm and codeine. i live alone in a 1-room apartment, in a different city, far from my family. but so it happened that one day, my mother visited me and found my stash. i know i shouldve probably been more careful but at that point, i literally didnt give a fuck about hiding my drugs, since i was the only person living there and i thought that no one would search for anything in my house, as long as im there. but anyway, my mother was pissed at me. knowing her, i sincerely thought shed smack my face but she was surprisingly calm. she just told me that she didnt want me to be a fucking junkie and that i should stop. now, heres the thing: ive tried many depression and anxiety meds, tried therapy, tried many diets, excercise, tried yoga and many more...even fucking praying and colon cleansing. i was so depressed that i was basically on the verge of commiting suicide all the time. drugs saved me at that point. i would have killed myself during those dark times if i didnt have drugs. it never turned into addiction, though. i would always leave at least 1 or 2 weeks of break between dosing. i never took huge quantities of substances and ive never re-dosed in the same day. i never mixed substances with one another and never messed with dangerous combos. i consider myself to be a responsible user and my drug use has never gotten out of hand. however, my parents didnt understand this. they wouldnt understand that using drugs in recreational purposes, every now and then, was not going to harm me. my mother, of course, told my father about it. he went absolutely berserk, yelling at me and cursing, saying that he hates me and that hes ashamed of me. he keeps saying that he hates druggies and that im a disappointment. here, in my country, drug users arent seen as simply drug users. theyre seen as addicts. people here dont know the difference between 1) being hopelessly addicted and 2) using a substance in a responsible way, in order to get a desired effect or in order to get a sense of relief from mental or physical pain. ironically, most people here are smokers and alcoholics. we are one of the leading countries when it comes to alcoholism. my father is - ironically - an alcoholic and a smoker ever since he was 8 years old. he gets drunk every few days and smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day. my mother keeps telling me that \"drugs are bad\" and that \"i am responsible for my own happiness\" while basically popping xanax every day (shes also been on prozac and anafranil). she thinks that praying is the only solution to a persons torment but doesnt want to admit that the only reason why she hasnt killed herself is because shes on antidepressants']\n",

      "['my thoughts out, and i have been feeling beyond down recently. not sure why, theres a lot of changes coming up in my life and ive been putting a lot of pressure on myself to please the people around me. i feel like i havent worried about what ive wanted to do once since last year, except for a little bit in the winter. last year my brother was full on depressed, suicidal, addicted to benzos, you name it, and i was thrown right into the middle of it. my dad is usually the rock of emotion in our household, and i take after him, but i was not prepared to deal with this. i had just graduated, was on top of the world, and the second i went home it was like the world collapsed. my mom and brother were making physical threats to each other. my brother would go get hammered by himself and wed have to find him. my mom would come into my room every day and burst into tears. she was so worried about him she never thought to ask about me. so everything fell on me. i was the anchor of emotion putting on a positive calm face when i was dying from stress and the fear of not having my brother around anymore. i feel like since then ive never processed all of it and everyone just thinks i was fine through it, but it fucked me up.later my girlfriend and i started having problems. she was super supportive through the whole situation, but she demands a lot emotionally and i dont think i was ready for that. we had already been together for a year, but i instantly went back to tailoring her needs before mine, even though some part of me knew that i was feeling strange. it ended up blowing up and we broke up, only to get back together a couple weeks later. thats the last time i really felt like me.i love her to death, but we are so different. she is so organized and type a when it comes to planning out her life, whereas i think its better to be adaptable and go with the flow. but she asks me to do these things that will make her happy and i do them without thinking for myself. i think thats a big part of it. i think ive developed almost a robotocism (made up a word) towards her and just always say yes and agree, just to see her smile. i care about her too much and put my own mental health at risk for hers. the other night i finally realized that this feeling was back. when i was at school i had the same feeling and that was the first big step in my recovery process. im hoping that this time will be the same. i told my family and i agreed to therapy this time, largely because of my girlfriend (same girl). i had taken so much pride before in getting through my first bout of depression by myself, and i was so stubborn towards going. but i think its time. i miss my old self, and i want to do whats needed to feel better. i think the worst part of it is putting my girlfriend through it, it sucks to see her confused and worried and unsure when i tell her whats going on. im gonna finish up saying when i feel good i feel fantastic. im humble, caring, and want to lift others up and watch them succeed. now i need to gloat and get jealous of others accomplishments. i know that somewhere inside me there is the real me. but this subreddit has made me feel my old way again a little bit. i sincerely hope that everyone on here feels better, whether its just a little slump or a serious depression']\n",

      "['my older sisters underpants because there wasnt money for my own.) my mom found a new guy who came into our lives as the babysitter whilst she worked in a coffee shop (the weed kind). &#x200b;i dont remember much from my childhood, but i do most vividly remember the 12 years of terrible marriage that followed.  i started excluding myself from any and all situations to do with my direct family, just to avoid any and all of the shit. i never asked for help, i never asked for anything really. my sister ran away from home and she got all the support and help she needed from the rest of our family. fast-forward to the end of those 12 years and my mom finally gathered to courage to leave this asshole she shouldnt have ever married. im not sure what happened, but for some reason i stayed living in the same house as him. i mustve been around 20 at the time. we got into a couple heated arguments until i finally decided id had enough of his shit as well, i packed the essentials of my shit and ended up living with my sister for a little while.my sister had been suffering from agoraphobia for a while at that moment and she didnt really have the space to have another person live with her. so after not too long i moved in with my mom who was living in an anti-squatter apartment and had a spare bedroom. it might not have been the best idea of timing but at that time my boyfriend who was living with his parents in england moved over here to live with me. it wasnt hurried, just not the best timing. i had a full-time job and was able to provide for us both. my mother moved in with her new boyfriend and we ended up having the place for ourselves which was pretty cool.  sadly my boyfriends mental health took a big hit after he moved over and he was unable to get a job or really do much of everything as he suffers from an overwhelming amount of anxiety.&#x200b;the anti-squatter place was set to be broken down and we ended up looking for a new place to rent, when we were finally offered one and i went to check it out with my mother she broke down in the apartment, telling me she couldnt let me live in such a gross place (to be fair, it was really bad) and she offered for us to move in with her and her boyfriend for the time being until we found something better. her new boyfriend is the sweetest guy id ever met and took us in as if we were his own children. for a little while things started looking up, my mother was happy and her boyfriend wasnt abusive, i had job and my boyfriend had all the time he needed to get back on his feet.&#x200b;it didnt take long however for me to start and having issues with getting out of bed and going to work. in secret i had been depressed for quite a while now but the only thing id had known was to pretend everything was fine and just keep going. i lost my job because i just didnt show up one too many times. i started seeing a psychologist but i wasnt honest with them about how i felt and was doing so that ended up leading nowhere. i got a new job and for about half a year i was able to pretend everything was fine again. thats  when i started slipping again, i was very lucky and my employer gave me a 2 month paid leave until the end of my contract to get back on my feet again. i even got to keep my company car for that time. i wasnt alright though, but with my boyfriend having no income and us about to move into our own place i had to continue pretending i was managing alright. i got another job and the whole thing started over again.&#x200b;from that point onward until about 3 years ago we managed to keep our heads afloat, both of us seeing therapists and working on our own health, whilst i tried my best to keep my job and provide for us both. then i started slipping again, my last employer was very understanding and gave my every opportunity and chance the could and then some, but this wasnt something that was just going to go away by itself, i had known this for a long time now. with the help of my then employer and the excellent laws pertaining sick employees i finally got the help i needed, i received a diagnosis (avoidant  personality disorder and depression']\n",

      "['my story, and maybe shine some hope onto those who might read this. i was raised by a mother with borderline personality disorder, and another mother with severe anxiety. my sister was a premature baby, 1lbs 15oz, she had a 10% chance of living. shes 25 now, 100% healthy and normal functioning human being. she lived the first year of her life in the hospital. all of these things primed for a very dysfunctional household. i came in 5 years later. my sister was the favourite child, and my parents did everything for her. if you know anything about borderline, then you know exactly what its like to grow up with a mother with it. (r/raisedbyborderlines for the best info on the web) basically borderline is similar to narcissism. they like to manipulate and control the people close to them. they will do anything to make sure everyone validates their own feelings. they are typically helicopter parents because they need to control every aspect of their childrens lives. you can read more about them at raisedbyborderlines!so my childhood sucked basically. anxiety, depression, self-image issues, all of these are extremely common of children raised by borderlines. guess what ive got them all. my family was pretty low income too. so money was always tight. until i was 15 and worked at a summer camp and made some friends, i had basically been brainwashed by my mother. i realized all the things i was deprived of. friends, parties, any kind of mature content. i became rebellious, i lied constantly to get away from home. i did things i wasnt supposed to. things at home started to go bad quickly. i was lectured and scolded, i was put-down and belittled. i was emotionally abused. when i was 16 decided i had adhd. i went to my family doctor and filled out the forms, was ready to get my new medication. instead of adhd, they told me i had depression. i was a naive little kid, so i went with it. i started taking the pills, things at home got worse. i cycled between different medications every 3-4 months as nothing seemed to be working. i started to drink alcohol way more. id lie and say i was going to an approved friends house, but instead, go to a different house and get drunk. i was lectured more and more, told i was worthless. grounded. refused permission to go to reasonable places overnight. i lied more and more. i needed to escape home. i couldnt take the abuse. i went to this party just after i started taking antidepressants, drank two whole pints, smoked a few bowls, while my meds amped the effects twofold. i blacked out completely and got lost in the woods. friends searched for hours for me. i showed up after like 4 hours covered in cuts and dirt. i remember nothing from that night. scariest experience of my life. well, obviously things got worse at home. i started smoking weed every weekend with my pals over the winter. lets fast forward a year. im 18 and im in my first semester at university hours away from home. great things should be great, i dont have to deal with my family. im free to do whatever i want. i made the football team there too. i thought things were gonna be great. boy was i wrong. i had trouble making friends (fuck you anxiety) i didnt do well in school. my depression was starting to peak. i stopped going to class. i smoked weed in my room every day. i slept like 16 hours a day. i started branding my forearm with a hot lighter. i was so deep in the hole i felt like there was no exit. jump to christmas break. ugh, i had to be with my family again. as to be expected my family was unbearable. they didnt see i was suffering so much. i had enough. they broke me. i tried to kill myself just days before christmas. i was ready to die, i wanted it to be all over. i woke up in the hospital the next day. in hindsight taking 60 sleeping pills wasnt the most effective way to kill myself. my mother got mad at me for killing myself. she talked about how hurtful it was that i would do that to her. nothing was any better at home. my cry for help failed but i had been given another chance at life. i transferred schools for the second semester. i got into a room with one of my best friends who was in the same program. i was down the hall from two of my other best friends. but i left football. football is my passion. transferring schools is the biggest regret in my life. i would have been able to play football if i stayed at the first school, but i probably would have failed out and tried to kill myself again if i stayed. but then again i dont know. maybe that wouldnt have happened. things started going uphill. i was with my friends, i was doing okay in school. i was away from home still. but bad news, during exams i developed severe insomnia. there goes my days of sleeping to avoid the depression. i was up for 22 hours of the day im average. i was going insane. i had a few mental breakdowns. i failed 3 of my classes. back into the pit we go. the summer wasnt much better. i tried to stay away from home as much as possible. smoked so much weed. slept in my car. slept on couches. went to a stupid fucking delivery job. spent all my money on food and weed. i was reaching a new low. i kept myself from self-harming though, i have proudly been self-harm free for almost a year. i still bear the scars, but they help to remind me that i cant return to that place i was once in. now we are in the present day. i pushed for an adhd diagnosis from my psychiatrist, which i got. i stopped taking antidepressants. i had initially wanted it all along but my incompetent family doctor was too stupid to see the signs. getting that diagnoses changed my life. i got that needed kick-start yo my day. in no way is my depression gone, my lord its here every day. but i have taken control of it. i have my days, i still struggle to go to class, i still lay in bed all day sometimes. but now i have good days. im making progress. i havent talked to my family in months. im renting my own place after this school year is over. my girlfriend has been so supportive. im still depressed. i still have insomnia. i still have anxiety. i still was abused as a child. i still wanna die sometimes. all of these things are still here. but i intend to kick their fucking asses eventually. when i woke up in the hospital room that day, something in me changed. i dont know what it was really. i guess the point of this huge essay is that there is hope. and i wanted to share some of my own. i see people talking about wanting to die. that death would be such a relief. and all the different variations of that. i agree. if i was dead i probably would be happy. i wouldnt have to deal with any of this. i wouldnt have to be in pain anymore. but choosing to die should not be what you really want. im giving depression']\n",

(i tried to hide it. always said i was going to a friends house or something just to avoid being home, while i just sad in my car at some empty parking lot). i think some of you know how it is. i tried committing suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills but i ended up throwing them up.finally i found a psychologist. he was a cool dude, and he somehow understood me. over the course of 5 months i wasn’t feeling better, but i finally opened up to some of my friends about it (it was very hard, because i hadn’t talked to them for a while). my psychologist was so happy about it and i didn’t understand why. but then it suddenly hit me. i was actually feeling better, and i had some friend who understood my behavior and they still loved me.right now i am traveling the world with my best friend. as i am writing this, i am enjoying a view of one of new zealand’s beautiful waterfalls. this is 2 years after i got my depression']\n",
