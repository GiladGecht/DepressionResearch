      "['i lack all the objective/interpersonal means to do it.*background: since 2013, i suffer from all symptoms of severe depression (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3181882/) mixed with some kind of anxiety disorder with recurrent obsessive-compulsive behaviors (order, hygiene, social phobia…). this has lead me to social isolation and insomnia. no income, totally parent-dependent, dropped out of college, never had a job and only a friend remains loyal. hypothesis: psilocybin (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/psilocybin) has been proved in several clinical studies as the most powerful antidepressant/anxiolytic ever known. a single dose is enough to change psychological markers up to 6 months after intake and toxicity and dependence are near to 0 (tolerance is very high). my guess is that this substance could change my neurochemistry or even inflammation levels (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5542678/) in order to allow an adaptive brain function, ending my depressive-anxious disorder. considering current evidence, our thoughts are made of neurotransmitters, not the other way around: this empirical approach on psychobiology rather than cognitive psychology is the chosen path to follow here. i will not enter in brain receptors details neither how tryptamines look like serotonin etc. since i lack the knowledge.testing: in this first phase, i’ve only taken 2 moderate doses. first of them was 2.5 dried grams of psilocybin cubensis. some visuals, very improved mood, a lot of energy to accomplish simple tasks that i could enjoy and some “philosophical insights”. the major most recent one happened after a couple days after the second dose (1.9g, two weeks after): “attachment is the root of my suffering, the more i convince myself that i need something, the more fear/anxiety/depression i will feel and that’s what is keeping myself away from connecting and loving other people, things, ideas.... because true passion and love cannot happen if there’s the fear of loss or the craving/urgence of accomplishment.”. conclusions: at first sight from a materialistic/western/empirical approach, this reasoning makes no sense. how could you be happy and progress in life if you “don’t give a fuck” about failure/loss/defeat/death? sounds a paradox but it seems my brains works better when it’s released from the burden of attachment (a past/future cognitive dynamic?). i’ll give you an example: i went to buy some food at the supermarket but suddenly i did something different i almost never do (openness improved) that is to “perceive” the hq shopping cars that are better than the ones i only used because you don’t have to “bow” each time you purchase an item. this may sound very simple and stupid from a well functioning mind, but for a depressive']\n",

(for reference, i am now 22 years old.). this means there is always an uncomfortable aura in the house which means i can never fully unwind. i share a room with my brother and mother. the room was never meant to house more than one person and an extension, aka \"work room\" was built on to the bedroom which is what my brother and i share. i also have a grandfather who lives in vegas and hes been wanting me to live up there with him but i need to make money first, and i cant hold a job.**hobbies**: growing up, video games, listening to music, and reading books were my favorite things to do. overtime, ive lost interest in books though and i waste a lot of time on reddit these days. i also golfed from a very young age to about 17. i never liked it, i just did it because i thought my mom wanted me to do it. ive also had many random passing thoughts go by but never act on them. for example: archery, playing guitar/drums, making youtube videos, writing things, running and hiking are a few. ***jobs:*****counter/cook** - first job. held for 2 years. age 18-20. i was generally a good worker and dependable but occasionally i would show up a few minutes late. i had a good thing going at this particular restaurant and management liked me, but i quit. this was around the time i failed college. i even was rehired for a few weeks by the same manager before i impulsively quit again.**busser**-didnt get past the online orientation because i thought it was needlessly complicated, so i walked out.**cashier** (gas station)- made it past orientation but didnt show up for shifts.**cashier** (grocery store)-i made it one day, then stopped showing up.**movie theater**-got hired and didnt show up because my body wouldnt move out of the car. **movie theater (different location, current. age 22.) - finished my first shift yesterday and my brain really wants me to fall back to familiar habits and go no show again.***medical*****therapist** - started seeing one around age 19. i thought she wasnt helping me by just talking general stuff. so i cut off contact.**psychiatrist** - started seeing one age 21. depression']\n",

      "['i bring up now is a fight. we cant even calmly disagree because i think because they cant admit that theyre wrong. i admit ive gotten heated unnecessarily because of the fucked up shit thats going on and i try to change their minds, but my dad takes anything i say negative to trump personally. its so fucking weird. he thinks the media \"ignores any positives\" yeah its fucking hard when he says literally stupid shit every single day. he says im brainwashed. lol ok but im literally reading what the president is saying? not spun around in some positive way by a tv hack? even if im just expressing an opinion im attacked. i mostly get hurt from disbelief. if i bring up \"grab em by the pussy\" they bring up clinton...ok so youre cool with both? why did you hate clinton when he did it then? why repeat it?today i was talking to my mom about a case study we went over in school and how a red state did not want any federal government involvement and had no regulations and polluted all this water and she gave me this look and said \"oh are we about to get political i dont want to hear it\"its not politics, its literally what happened. ask republicans theyll tell you the same - they dont want government involvement and sometimes that has consequences.my dad fucking thinks that \"republican means hard working. i like it when people work - not sit around on welfare\" lol okno matter what i say they will not acknowledge that they would not have even been able to immigrate here with trump in power. their love of the republicans is because they grew up in a communist country that was awful but still. they say the only reason the us accepted them is because it wanted to create unrest in their home country. yeah you took advantage of that...why not let others have the same option for a better life?theyre educated. what the fuck? i resorted to sending my dad some articles but he just admitted to me that he doesnt read them because he doesnt care.truth is now a matter of opinion. its so fucking stupid.my dad said hillary was the original birther and when i brought up literally a fact check of the first time that happened and it was trump and ted cruz attributed it to hillary, he laughed at me. he thinks george soros wants to \"destroy america.\" he watches greg gutfeld and tucker carlson and sean hannity. he believed that black people in south africa are killing white farmers. he doesnt have a concept of no evidence or credible journalism with sources. he thinks these are beliefs and opinions. he thinks the press reporting on what trump says is not news and they should report on \"good things like the economy.\"my mom thinks there is no truth and history has two sides always. she says \"leave the man alone he got elected.\"i guess theyre the kind of people who had to lay low and just work during a communist regime so theyre used to that, but my god you should have seen my dad during obama. i once said i think obama is cool guy and he went off. i said trump is divisive and polarizing (which is true) and he attacked me asking why. because he says polarizing things? by the time i got him to chill out for me to explain the definition of polarizing i was in tears because of how heated things have become. he still doesnt udnerstand.my mom also thinks \"obama is a muslim deep down and went easy on muslim nations and his dad is one\" lol ok mom suremy parents are nice people. theyre the most caring parents one could ask for, but sometimes theyre so fucking dumb. i literally went into a bout of depression']\n",

is it your ultimate desire to stay depressed or is there any hope at all to change?if there is no hope at all then obviously i am wasting my time and ruining my karma, but if there is anybody out there at all who desires motivation from this sub then i hope this long post helps.im 22 now, but all-throughout my teenage years i was borderline depressed. i wouldnt say i actually was depressed, but i definitely had unhealthy thoughts. i never would have committed suicide but i would fantasize a lot about it, wondering how i would do it, who would care, and when the best time to do it would be. i grew up in a strict christian household that forbade just about everything i found joy in. no rock music allowed, no reading my favorite books including harry potter, no playing cards, no watching movies unless the director and cast were devout christians. i was taught to never question god and always obey my father whose word was final. because of this, i learned to never voice my opinions because doing so would often result in insanely long lectures, sometimes lasting half the day, 6+ hours, about how i was wrong and need to listen to him. my mother always followed his say, repressing her own feelings and attitudes for 26 years of their marriage until finally they divorced when i was 11 and all the built-up repression spewed out. my dad was a trucker who was gone a week or 2 at a time, but from 11+ onward most of my memories with them are about them arguing over every single thing imaginable (also, though divorced neither of them could afford to live separately from each other, so this is what i grew up with for the rest of my adolescence). so while my father was entirely tyrannical, my mother justifiably couldnt take it anymore. however, since then she has always had the victim mentality that still continues today. everything is always somebody elses fault, she is never the one to blame, and she will never take responsibility even when she is clearly the cause. when i moved out to attend university, i felt a huge weight was taken off my shoulders but another weight had replaced it. i was away from my familys toxicity, but in my classes i was learning about all this horrible stuff happening in the world which only seemed continual with no sense of relief and no hope of change. i abandoned religion when i was 16, so i couldnt find comfort in god. my social history is that of an introverted-extrovert; i was sociable and happy for the most part, had friends but not really any close friends since moving away from my hometown, and while i genuinely was happy and not completely enveloped in depression, it was also partly a facade for deeper negative emotions i didnt want others to see. overall, for most of my college experience i felt alone with nowhere to really find comfort and possessing a world view that the purpose of life was to try to find a light with a paper bag taped over your head. while for most of my life my livelihood has been in a negative state, recently i can say that all of it has changed. at age 20 i went on a road trip with my brother and during the drive he was trying to tell me to see the beauty of the world and that i shouldnt be so negative, but i wasnt listening. i just quietly dismissed everything he was talking about. when we reached our destination i consented to try mushrooms, and because of this i witnessed a completely different mode of consciousness that finally made me realize the nonsense of my state. i witnessed my first dis-association from my thoughts and finally felt free from this constant burden of mine. this experience opened me up afterwards to see with fresh eyes what i would normally have condemned and left unexplored. i became fascinated with psychology to know why my brain works the way it does, rediscovered meaning through religion (though it is not entirely conventional), and started questioning other cases of how i, myself, was the cause of my own suffering. i finally understood what my brother was talking about during the drive and wept at how i was purposefully blinding myself from seeing the light, only adding more tape to the bag over my head because it was the only thing i knew how to do.i see a lot of posts in here condemning other people for naive comments on how to just be happy. a lot of posts blame other things for their continual state of depression whether it be chemical deficiencies, other people, or societys mold placed over you on how you should be. i am not totally naive to physiological and other biological causes for depression, but i must say i dont think i can ever fully comprehend what its like without personally being affected by it. i understand it to be something way out of peoples conscious control, and for that i could only wish to have more empathy than i do now. however, i have to question is it your identification as the depressed one, the sufferer, the victim maintaining those chemical deficiencies? is it your original world view constructed and reinforced through countless years of conditioning causing this? like my mother, i too identified as the victim until i found the state of consciousness aware of my thoughts, and by being aware of them i was able to dis-associate from them similar to awakening from a dream that had taken place over my entire life.i see a lot of posts desiring to be understood by other people, for a social connection to their deeper layer of unhappiness. to this i say sure, i understand this desire. but are you simultaneously capable of understanding others not in your realm of thinking?

      "['i just need a place to vent so most of this will likely be incoherent.im 18 and a freshman in college and for the past 3-5 years of my life ive started hating myself more and more. it started out slow with just finding some of my insecurities annoying but its evolved into hating the entirety of the person ive become and im not sure i can do anything about it. im antisocial and socially awkward but ive managed to get myself into a few different friends groups, even though im fairly certain im at the bottom of all of them. i have contradicting feelings that make me question whether im depressed or just a pussy when it comes to life. im really insecure about myself and how i act and whether what indo is perceived as normal or weird. i also almost always second guess conversations and relive every mess up i have when i flounder in casual conversation, which happens a lot. i have some really good times with these friend groups but the moment theyre over i have my lowest lows where i just lay on my bed listening to music that just makes me feel worse for hours. it feels as if im simply a spectator to life, where even though i have friend groups im often not invited or told about some events, or im talked over, or it just feels as if its unnecessary for me to be there. i think about death and wanting to die on a daily basis, yet actively committing suicide or doing anything that would purposefully put me in danger is too active. instead i constantly think \"hey itd be awesome if i could be diagnosed with some rapid fatal disease\" or \"god i really hope a truck comes out of nowhere and t-bones me when i go through this intersection\". im at a point where i dont think ill ever commit suicide, but i also dont fear death and find myself longing for it. i think there are people who care about me, mostly family and relatives but i can tell that im often a burden to them or frustrate them because im total assholes to them. i no longer am expressive towards people and often do the bare minimum to the point where i rarely even say \"i love you\" to my family members and only do it when i think im supposed to and not because i want to say it. i was doing research and im not too sure if i have schizoid because ive become pretty emotionally distant; most of the time i interact with people or friends it feels like im either faking it or altering my personality to mimick theirs because i just dont feel things the same way anymore. i think a large part of the way im feeling is because i dont have anyone in my life that cares for me or i care for. im almost 19 years old and talking to people i dont know stresses me out, ive never had a girlfriend or any super close friends, ive kept most of my personality, feelings and thoughts buried deep inside me for years. the other night when i was hanging out with my closest friend group we were all drinking and having a really good time for the first few ours. i probably drank too much and i got really depressed, and while i know alcohol can do that to you i dont think that was it; instead it simply felt like the years of covering up and burying my feelings was undone and i got a glimpse of my extremely depressed inner self, to the point where for the remainder of the night i was just sitting kneeled up in corners hating and isolating myself. my friends saw this and tried go bring me back in the conversations but i ended up just pushing them away. my one friend even came up to me and was like \"hey lets talk, anything you want to say say it and lets talk about it\" to which i basically said \"i really wish i could but i physically cant. i really appreciate you coming to try and talk, but you should just go back and enjoy yourself, im fine\". this was just the other night and i regret it so much because we all wont see each other for a few more months with winter break coming to an end and i spent the majority of our last night in a corner depressed by myself pushing them away. that night i saw how raw and depressed i am on the inside and it honestly has scared the shit out of because i didnt think i was anywhere near that low.all in all ive just become a total asshole over the years, to friends, family, people in general and i hate who ive become. and as i said before, i dont see me killing myself but i also dont see a future past college. i have no dreams or aspirations because i know ill never get there, and it feels like im only living and doing things because im supposed to and its what people expect of me. i just wish i could pop out of existence. i realize i should probably get a therapist or find someone to talk to but ive got my feelings so locked up i just cant bring myself to do it. i also fear that if i go to a therapist or doctor theyll just tell me theres nothing wrong with me and thats its all in my head or that what im experiencing isnt what i think. i feel so empty, stressed, depressed']\n",

i found a girl at my work that was worthwhile, someone i could literally see myself with. have you heard the saying, if your patient the right girl will come to you...well, she was the one for me, the girl ive waited and looked for so long. she literally had every quality i wanted from a girl, sincerely nice, outgoing and fun. i changed so much for her. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people and i went back to finish college and even got my first real career job as a software developer just to prove to her im not a loser. in someways, it helped made me become the cool, confident person i always wanted to be and envisioned myself to be when i became 21. basically, i felt like i was at my prime and i thought that everything was going into place, this was the fantasy moment i always envisioned.she took notice of my change from that quiet shy guy to the new person i am now, and me and her got close for the past few months. we never kissed or held hands but i definitely felt some small spark and unlike other guys shes been with, she didnt mind the occasional kiss on the cheeks here and there. she is touched with the things i do for her and we would spend hours together after work. i would help her with work off the clock, comfort her when she was down and do just anything to make her happy.... she would drag me everywhere and she says my name in a certain way that just makes my heart melt. she was the first girl i ever felt being fully comfortable being just myself around. i thought this was a sign.... i just needed that one break, that one chance to prove to her that i am an awesome person that wont hurt her like her ex did to her.....i never got a real chance, i was shot down even before i could ask her out on a date...a real date with just me and her and not a group thing with her friends....she told me she did have some feelings for me, but she said shes afraid it would never workout. she said she doesnt want to lose me if it never works out....she was sincere about that but i knew the other big real reason. she is still hung up on her ex. she always told me she was over him but when a girl says shes 99% over with her ex, you know she is totally not. the ex works right next door and would always come over to her and try to patch things up with her. she never gave me a real chance because she still loves him....and im left in the dust, heartbroken, a \"friend\" in her eyes and at best a plan \"b\".....i dont talk to her as much anymore as i just wanted my feelings to die at this point....talking to her would just bring those feelings back...and i dont want to go back....the pain was already too much the first time...i became so fucking depressed. this wasnt the first time this happened to me, ive had girls do this to me before, but i didnt take it too seriously cause i wasnt really very close to those girls. but i felt so sure about this one....it was the closest ive ever been to a girl and the closest ive ever been to getting a girlfriend and for the first time ever, i truly felt the \"spark\" i always hear about from relationships. it hurts even more that despite my brain saying to just move on, my fucking heart keeps on trying to find any excuse to try again. i feel awkward now because sometimes the new coworkers comment on how i am. some are flattering, like they say how im pretty cute but others say i look like a fuckboy or a chad. its just a reminder of how much i changed. they judge my appearance and demeanor and thought i be the type to have a girlfriend but really i am a socially awkward loveless loser...and them saying that only makes me feel so fucking fake...of how much i changed for someone that never truly had the same feelings back...one things for sure, i dont think i can open up to another girl anymore....atleast for a while....now its just wallowing in my sorrow of being so alone in this fucking world....i just want one fucking chance....why is it so fucking hard to give a guy a chance....&#x200b;tl:dr;  i never had a girlfriend. every rejection pushed me to better myself in someway. recently met the girl of my dream. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people. she was interested in me and i was in love with her, but she wouldnt let go of her ex. then she rejected me and said she liked me as a \"friend\".....biggest heartbreak ever. now, im depressed']\n",

      "['i am so fucking lonely and feel like such a fucking loser. i am 21 fucking years old, turning 22 in a few months and ive yet to fucking find even a grain of love from someone i held feelings for. like what the fuck is wrong with me? i feel so fucking lonely for the longest time, and at the time when i really needed someone elses affection to help me get through the toughest time in my life, ive only succeeded in having another girl just reject my feelings towards her. this makes me feel like trash because this wasnt the first time it happened. ever since middle school, every girl that rejected me had always something about me that they didnt like and me being so insecure about myself thought that perhaps if i change myself into a better person, maybe i could get someone to finally accept my feelings back.i changed so much for these girls. i changed how i looked, how i dressed, how i acted, became more fit, confident, humorous, good-looking, heck i fucking even got better grades in my school and continued my education in college just to show off i am not a loser....as if i am like competing for being an eligible bachelor in those cheesy sitcoms. nobody wouldve recognized the disgusting, nervous wreck of a person i was before into the confident guy i am now.&#x200b;heres a picture of me on the left with the stripe shirt:[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/d/d0/1252512511.png/revision/latest?cb=20181001021806](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/d/d0/1252512511.png/revision/latest?cb=20181001021806)&#x200b;yet even when i changed so much, even when i felt like i was at my prime and at the tender age of 21, i still fucking failed! this latest girl was soooo different from all the other girls ive met. i truly felt like she was going to be the one, the girl that would be my very first love. but i was an idiot. i guess the last flaw i never was able to get fixed was figuring out if a girl liked me or not. i waited too long and didnt show my affection and now her feelings towards me had vanished. i realized my mistake the moment she said these words...\"just be yourself ramon, you dont have to be anyone else to impress me\"......no girl has ever said such a thing to me, and when i heard it from her, thats when i instantly fell in love wit her. i realized my mistake and tired desperately to rekindle that feeling but i couldnt get her to have the same spark she had before. she said in her own say that she has still embers of feeling towards me, but that she didnt believe it would last long if me and her got together. from what conversations we had for each other, it seemed to me shed rather keep me as a friend then to lose me as a person.....she was a truly amazing person, and despite myself, i was more than willing now more than ever to be anything she wanted me to be if she just gave me one last chance. but apparently this girl doesnt have feelings for people based on how they are as a person but more if she holds a certain spark for them. my spark for her is immense and white-hot but her for me is small embers.i hope you guys understand my feelings right now as i typed this with tears rolling down my cheeks as i had to vent my feelings out somewhere. ive heard soon she will be leaving the workplace me and her both work at (which is the only place me and her really get to be together) and i feel like i will never find another girl like her in the world. she always says that even if we wont see each other for a while, she still thinks we are close friends but despite myself i cant see myself without her. she isnt allowed to go out and have social interactions because of her strict parents, so i keep on being afraid she would find someone else in her new job and she would forever be taken from me. shes going to be another reminder of my failure in finding love and i am once again alone. the reason why i desperately seek love is because ive never felt any true love in my own family and i cant get the same feeling from my friends. she was a truly loving person and her family was very loving as well, the kind of family i always wanted growing up and i was more than willing to be a part of. i was willing to have given her the world...now here i am....back at my community college working to transfer to san diego state university, working a second job as programming intern job in a medical/health tech startup. sometimes i contemplate if i should go work at the new place where she is planning to work next just so i can get some quality time with her again. some people would say that i am successful and happy and getting somewhere in life. what they dont know is that deep inside, i am insecure, alone and depressed']\n",

      "['i have been fighting depression, add and anxiety pretty much since i was 12--im approaching 50 now. the roots of these diagnoses i suspect are deep in my parents early divorce, probable attachment disorder and intermittent emotional neglect and psychological abuse.  i was diagnosed at 16 and had some good luck with anti-depression meds at first.  my mainstay coping mechanisms, though, developed in early college:  alcohol and weed.  i did take meds intermittently, but never felt great about big pharmas game and the results were so mixed that although i was often using anti-depressants and stimulants, i mostly tried to self medicate, plus drinking and getting high were socially acceptable and encouraged in my friend groups.  i also fell in love in early adulthood, and 18 years later i’m divorced with a (now 10 year old) son.  and although we had a good 12 years, the final years of marriage were awful.  the sobriety of parenting together undid us, and i firmly believe it was in no small part because we no longer were able to numb out on booze together.  plus i was not able to get it up (thanks years of weed and meds!) which of course did not help the reduction of intimacy that often follows a first child.  years of resentment boiled up as we proved to be more and more out of love as our beautiful baby became a boy.  my ex dealt with our dysfunction by sleeping with my trusted “friend”. the ugly end of literally the only beneficial family relationship i had left, that seemed unshakable only years before, also happened at about the same time as my career collapse, something that also seemed unlikely.  in that same year my marriage shattered, i had to walk out of the elementary classroom i taught to be tried before hr for the decline of my abilities, only to lose my composure so entirely that i had to go home mid-day without even saying good-bye to the students.  i went on long term disability the next day for my mental state and never returned to that school or classroom teaching.   my son’s age at the unraveling of our relationship, being almost identical to my own when my folks split, caused any healing i had done from that trauma to explode and fester.  i was going through all this as we marched through the stages of pre-trial divorce.  at the time i was given more and more meds to help me through, and i kicked regular substance use entirely, dropping decades worth of friendships (built on substances) from my life.  now it is almost 6 years later and i have had some successes (reduced my meds, still living without substances, steady employment) but have very little to show for a life at my age.  yes i am a consistent and loving dad (i know that is not a small thing, and i’m proud of that) with 50% custody but my income is just barely enough to allow me to live in the gentrified neighborhood my son knows and loves, that is near his mom, his school and his friends.  i have a career i can handle without having to be on tons of meds (nannying for a wealthy family) but i do not have any growth opportunities there, no prestige, no long term plan, no benefits, no retirement.  i am living paycheck to paycheck.  and even though i did have a positive relationship after the divorce for a couple of years, i am alone now and after a year of online dating and some near misses, i feel like from the outside i am a man without a future, without money, without an extended family and without ambition (beyond not being depressed).  although i look pretty good, i have persistent foot pain and low energy. i feel like i stink of mid-life collapse and i am losing faith that i will ever be able to attract anyone who can help me be the person i am capable of being, someone that i can love and be loved by.so back to my question:  since my sobriety and recent reduction of medications (this past year), i have become much less numb to my pain and tragic history. i am feeling all the feelings. as i have made my life smaller and more manageable i have tried to confront the feelings that drive so much of my inner conflict.  i have delved into many books, self-guided classes and attempts at living a more healthy life.  i have gone deeper into psychotherapy than i ever could have on all those meds, but i am so deflated and tired  from the depth of the lows, that i wonder if really feeling my feelings is going to help me anymore.  i have been able to find a few core things that i can tell really do help me (yoga, exercise, journaling, low-inflammation dieting, meditation) but i cannot seem to make any of them actual habits.  it’s hard to take on new habits alone, with almost no community and little discretionary income to invest in myself.from reading and listening to lots of books (on attachment, psychology, self-help, mindfulness, etc) i have been left with the overriding feeling that addressing my problems starts with developing good habits.  that if i only improve my character by developing better mental toughness then i will no longer live my traumas over and over again, and i’ll be able to use self-discipline to move on and contextualize my past so i can thrive in the present and future.  my therapist sees encouraging signs in our sessions, but my psychiatrist is very concerned at my plunging scores on depression']\n",

      "['i recently graduated high school and was dating someone for three years at that point. i believed myself to be happy, i was getting good grades, and on the surface i seemed like i was successful. i didn’t get into the university of my choice, but i was offered an opportunity to reapply if my gpa was high enough. at my graduation there was this girl i had started talking to from one of my classes. she was a 10/10, but a lot of people i knew didn’t like her because of what one of her ex’s says about her (that she’s crazy and a whore). i offered her some help early that year dealing with some of his crap and we became friends over it. everyone was hugging so i felt no shame in hugging her too. about a month later i broke up with my girlfriend. it took me 3 years to realize the whole time i was being emotionally abused and drained to the point my family noticed a complete change in my happiness. i went to drink the pain away, and instead of drinking alone like an idiot, i wanted to drink with someone that understood the pain i was going through. i texted her and she said yes, but she would have to sneak out. enter one of the best nights of my life and the start to the most memorable summer ever. we started dating two or three weeks later, after i was one of the few people to ask what happened to her when her phone went dark (she had gotten in serious trouble from her parents, no cell), and immediately fell in love with her family and her. she broke me out of a shell i had no idea i was in. we were sporadic, doing things on a whim. i had always wanted to live my life on a “why not” basis, and that was the only way we did anything. we would only plan for bigger things, occasionally throwing them out for better ones. in the summer she allowed me to experience what it meant to have fun, and to enjoy life. fall hit her hard though. she has so many problems from her dad leaving her family, one of which is seasonal depression. when i went off to college, we tried to make it work. she started to exist on seeing me on that once a week schedule, me being the only one to make her feel happier and fulfilled. meanwhile i had so much trouble adjusting and taking the pressure. i cut for the first time just before i left, and cut again later in the semester. i was disgusted with myself, but for some reason i still did it again. one night i nearly put a knife through my forearm, and another with my girlfriend, had a panic attack while drunk. she forced me to seek a therapist, and without that i likely would have been making this post. i cried on the way back home with her, and she was right there for me, realizing how fucked up i was. to say that it was all perfect though would be an oversight. we did break up during the semester and she did see someone for a one time thing. i decided not to hold it against her because of what she meant to me, and because it was totally stupid on her part. we would bicker at times too, often times because i would say something stupid because of a lack of social skills and her belief that she was fragile. yet it still worked until about middle of the semester where she greened out at a party and woke up to a guy who made a move on her. that was some final straw for her, and i think it broke her on some level and we broke up for the second time. assuming she needed time to figure things out, i started talking to close friends about the incident to get their opinions. i spoke to one of them who i forgot was a mandatory reporter. for the sake of brevity, i had to make a police report, and the night i made it she got a phone call from the local police department and the next day three officers showed up in her school. she screamed at me, but i knew what was at stake and what i had just done. her family lived on a knifes edge, and she was trying to repair her relationship with her mom. her friends could have started asking questions, possibly leaving her. her freedom became questionable, as she was getting high again, which was the reason in the summer she had got in so much trouble. but nothing happened. and i had to fix this. i hadn’t played piano in 10 years, yet two days after she screamed at me, i began again. in 10 days, i learned the song that symbolized the entire thing to me. i originally gave myself a window of 14 days, but i was ready. i recorded it and sent it to her, with the best apology i could have come up with. “it’s beautiful, but it doesn’t change anything.”and i knew that. but again in vain i still tried, i promised myself i would be home for her birthday so i was. i had already started on her gift and gave it to her. i just wanted to have a true conversation with her about all of this. to get closure and to understand what the future would hold. i have her my gift and asked her to talk to me, so we did. we talked for two hours. it came down to us being fundamentally different people, but agreeing we were each other’s best. that we could not be friends because the feelings would be to great. that we should try to move on from each other, and maybe decades down the line reconnect. when we hugged as a final goodbye, my throat hitched. she pulled away and put her hand on my face. she realized what she did immediately, but that was the moment that i became me. that i started to close off again.it was like this until she wished me happy birthday. she was the only one to do so, because i tell no one about it. but even my best friends didn’t say a word, so it meant something to me. i’m hindsight it was rather innocuous, but i dwelled on it for a little while. then walking through the city with my family it happened for the first time. i was looking at christmas lights and i saw us. laughing, looking up at the lights, holding each other. i blinked and it was gone. those moments have been happening occasionally since, in places that meant something to me or to us. i will see us in the perfect instagram ready photo, and it will ruin me for the day. i’ve tried my best to move on, got a tinder, started talking to as many people as possible. nothing works, and i realized it’s because i’ve been given the gift of caring for others: not flirting. so i’m going to delete my tinder and make sure that i’m not so stupid moving forward. about a week ago, i noticed her instagram post were getting progressively more depressing. she blocked me and unblocked in a span of 12 hours. i decided to say something, not as someone wanting her back, but as someone who was genuinely concerned. she said she was fine, and we texted until i got a one word response. now to summarize: we have the girl who broke me out of my shell and helped me experience life. who probably stopped me from someday killing myself. who was the one who taught me what true love really meant. and that i ruined in one action, to destroy any future chance i had. what i want now is what i wanted two months ago. i want this fixed, and i want to be able to hold her again. i decided this january i would think about making another attempt to reconnect, but if it seems too much i won’t. i really think it’s done and over with. i don’t need to hear the crap about “there’s so many other fish in the sea.” i know there are. but how many fish do you believe you owe your life to? that you think about every night? that you sometimes cry yourself to sleep over?if i had the chance again, i would live my life to the fullest with her. i’d change my dreams based on this one delusion. and i’m not sure if the world would agree with me. i just needed to put this in writing. if you’re still with me, am i crazy? i already know i’m depressed']\n",

with body image issues since i was 11 and the bulimia from sophomore year of high school. that was around the same time i started self harming. but no one could tell-i made sure to hurt myself in places covered by clothes and i still kept the same cheery demeanor i did everyday. i had good grades, a small but stable group of friends,  sports, played in the marching band. never went to a party. the ideal, boring high school student. my family had some issues, mainly between my brother and my dad, but i tried to stay out of it and be the dutiful daughter. doing chores, watching my siblings, listening to my parents. the self harming curbed as i was about to go to college but my eating disorder got worse. got to college and my first 2 years were pretty rough academically. skated by on natural talent in high school and realized that doesnt fly in university. ignored my grades and just tried to socialize as much as possible and started restricting my diet like crazy and working out for at least 2 hours a day just to feel in control. dropped to 105lb (im 54). was diagnosed with adhd my junior year much to the dismay of my parents-i was supposed to be the golden child. my brother was the trouble kid with the depression, anger issues, and adhd. just got medicated never went to therapy. junior year i was in a relationship. felt like i was soaring, continued to do mediocre in my classes and when i began to crash, i tried to turn to my then boyfriend for support but turns out he would rather go out to the bar and talk to other people. we broke up at the end of the year. depended on him so much i lost touch with a lot of friends and opportunities. during that time i didnt take my adhd meds regularly. just made me feel like shit that i had to take them in the first place. senior year my stress, depression, and anxiety was even worse. felt suicidal. was vomiting everyday and my grades were plummeting. felt like i was an idiot for picking a major as difficult as computer science when i wasnt applying myself like i should. tried a couple therapy sessions at the end of the year and tried to talk to my mom about sitting in on a session over the phone and she screamed at me about how i was faking/overreacting. dropped to 94lb around this time. i was also about to take my 5th year cause i had planned my classes so horribly and also wanted to improve my gpa. i think i wouldve really hurt myself seriously if my current boyfriend wasnt there to just keep me company and be positive. still, i never told him fully what was going on. now hes in california and im on the east coast and were doing a long distance thing and hes still amazing. so loving and kind and ive let him know to a small extent my feelings of depression and i made it seem like i used to have an eating disorder though i still have episodes to this day. but things at home are getting worse and my mom and dad are fighting, my brother (20, has pretty mentally abusive tendencies stemming from anger and depression) is making things harder on my mom and i can see her starting to crack. my little sister (11) cries in secret after their fights and im the one who tries to comfort her when shes trying to get away. im at home now for winter break and im so stressed about home life once i leave and my mom has no one to help her cook, clean, or listen to her. also been stressed this past month because last semester, right before finals i fainted twice in 3 days and got concussed. felt silly the first time i fainted (during an exam) and tried to brush it off and just made a couple appointments to check myself out the next week. fainted 2 days later, hit my head harder. concussed. still have headaches and my mood has been even lower but i still have to study. yet, im still trying to be supportive and happy for my mom. trying to help around the house while studying for the exams i couldnt take. trying to build a better relationship with my brother and help him even when he hurls abuse at me, not that thats always. trying and trying but not feeling like im making any progress. feel like im a failure. ive always \"joked\" for the last few years i wasnt gonna make it past 30 cause of stress and the fact i get sick all the time. been saying that a little more often and my boyfriends picking up on it and hes starting to get concerned but now im doing my best to cover it up. last night, he called me and i joked i wanted to die. but for a bit i didnt know if i was joking. i wasnt even sad anymore. just reached a point where i didnt feel anything and just thought of how i could kill myself-obviously didnt act on it. just told my boyfriend i didnt much want to talk about what was going on and went to sleep. i dont know if this is dissociation but i can imagine myself being gone without feeling much right now. and at the moment that doesnt even scare me. just wanted to get that off my chest. &#x200b;tldr; i look happy, successful, healthy, and smart but im dealing with an eating disorder, family issues, post concussion syndrome, academic struggles, and what i think is depression']\n",

(some background, me - 14, sister - 17, friend - 15) i felt so scared that she wasnt responding even though she was just asleep. i was breathing hard and shaking at work when i had nothing to do. i felt so pressured as well.* the company i work at (small little sandwich shop) has a jacket that i can wear if i get cold. i only wear it to cover up my arm because i dont want people to see my cuts. i had to wash the dishes and my boss said that i have to take off the jacket. i told her that my cat scratched me. she told me to show her and i did (it was one cut on the top of my arm, all the other cuts are on the other side of my arm). she asked me if i was okay and how im doing. i felt embarrassed but also comforted because she cares about me a lot. * i forgot to take my anxiety medicine today so it just hasnt been the best. i wish that i did this morning because today probably would have gone better. that is it from today at work, nothing else happened. if you did decide to go and read the other post i did, i did mention that i wanted to cut myself. and yes, i did mention that i do in this post. i found some sharp blades from a little handheld knife. the first time i cut i did not go very deep, just a few little scratches. i was clean for 2 days before i did it last night because life just has really gone horribly for me the past months. life just is not that good for me right now. i also mentioned that i was going to get a therapist and that was supposed to happen about a week ago. my mom is in new orleans with her friends (again, if you read the other post, i said that she goes out with them a lot and it has made my life not great). last weekend, when i did start to cut, she was gone and i couldnt talk to her, i didnt have the friends i talk to now whenever i want to cut. they do support me when i want to cut and they always at least try to convince me to not cut. it only works sometimes. most of the time, it doesnt work and i still end up cutting.i ate dinner last night. i went out with my friends to target and got a stomach ache. that is the very reason why i dont eat dinner, i get stomach aches whenever i eat dinner. i hate it so much. we were having such a good time then i just randomly got a stomach ache and kinda ruined my night. but it did eventually go away and my friends did make me feel better. something completely different from what i was saying, but i realized that i hate myself. i hate that i need so much attention and reassurance. i hate that i need to take medicine for something that so many people in the world dont even have to worry about (ironic). i hate that i cut myself when there are obviously so many other better ways to deal with depression']\n",

arranged marriage or tinder. so lets talk about an arranged marriage. i have to tell my family background to the family of the girl before i get to see her. and i live in seattle. it should be safe for me to not disclose these details and still be a nice person. because my family is composed of simple village-dwelling people. my parents are the sweetest people in the world but they are not successful, they dont have any accolades to show off. they still say that me and my brother are their biggest achievements, i mean the kind of people we have grown up as. they wont qualify any screening test and so wont i. now lets talk about tinder or neo-dating. im brown, im fit but im not athletic. im decent looking but im no rockstar. i write nice messages to everyone on okcupid. i do feel frustrated at times but i still am not rude to anybody for their choice of not liking me. i get it. but where does that put me? three years. not a single good friend. and its getting worse. i have lost my energy to want to impress people. and neither do i expect this from someone. i know im not a 10. i usually dont message anybody out of my league. the only people i dont message are people who i am not attracted to at all. and i guess the people who reject me are coming from a similar position. but it essentially creates capitalism out of dating. i dont want sex. i dont want anything hot. or a person who hikes. i just someone who likes me. and i would genuinely try to make it work. i wont reject someone because they dont have a wanderlust or if they are a recovering alcoholic. do other people see dating in this way? in my experience, a lot of us dont.i meditated. i wrote my journals. i read amazing books. i watched amazing shows and movies. i learnt to make music. i learnt to appreciate all kinds of music. i became well versed in philosophy. i am on my journey to become fairly well versed in psychology. i got healthy and i ran for miles. people say that im intelligent and creative. but at the same time, i got a pornhub premium subscription. i have smoked weed almost everyday for the past two years. my career makes no sense. i developed a bit of an eating disorder. i broke up with my best friend and my girlfriend. i want to go back to india but where exactly? thats a shitty feeling you know. the home no longer exists. when people tell me that im intelligent and creative, i think they are just saying it. they dont mean it. i see that the problem here is with self-esteem. i see all my problems very clearly. i still cant fix them. my hands go automatically to weed, then to my penis and then to pornhub. i constantly lie to myself and also to others. thats the depressing']\n",

(i wish i could see a doctor or therapist, as well; however, my parents blow over every request i make to see one, since either a.) its a waste of money or b.) mental illness is all in your head).going back to my brother, he had an hour long conversation about my attitude and my depression']\n",

i felt so warmed by all of my family that moment. it was a rough time for everybody, but we united. i remember every night sleeping in the same room with my mom and my little brother. i felt protected. our grandparents really helped us financially (and still do, as they paid mine and my brother’s college). but, in 2003, my mom met my stepfather, and, from there, things just became worse and worse.  i had no problems with him for the next 2 years. i kinda liked him. he was not my father, but i liked him. we used to play soccer games together in the ps2. but after some time his attitude changed. he became more… explosive?i was becoming a teenager and i always had something of a dark humor (not the racist/mysoginist/homophobic shit, but still dark humor). one day, he almost broke up with my mom after i made a joke calling him poor (he always had this strange money obsession, he really thinks he is rich, but we are just middle class). as a kid i was really confused with all of that, but that escalated. one day, going to the beach for the weekend, i got spanked in the car by my mom as my stepfather cheered it while driving. the motive was another joke that i made, about my stepfather shitting his pants (yeah he used to do that and leave the shitty underwear behind the bathroom door). that day was too much, too much for me and still terrifies me when i remember. i had never got beaten until that day. my cousin and my brother were in the car too. nobody did nothing to stop that.from that day on, my relationship with my mom went in a downward spiral of beating and shouting. for anything. the result? bad grades, isolation, tries with tobacco, alcohol and marijuana (at 13, 14 and 15yo respectivelly)... the whole family structure tumbled down. even today, i can’t communicate properly with my mom since i evolved a serious blockage. i don’t speak to my stepfather for more than 10 years, even living under the same roof. and it fucking messes with me.but, besides the experimentations with drugs and stuff, my teenage years were kinda normal. out of my house, i was a pretty confident person. i still had many friends (maybe not the best guys, but still friends), i had 3 girlfriends between 2008 and 2011, doing good enough to enter the journalism university… life was going on but, still, something was growing inside of me.my university didn’t helped a lot. i didn’t made any friends. it was not a campus, but just a cold, grey, boring building just downtown (still, academically, one of the best journalism colleges here in brazil). but after that, i got a freelance job at one of the biggest newspapers here in my state, so i thought the objective was accomplished.but i couldn’t avoid the troubles in my house, that kept going. so, in my time with my friends, i was really into drugs and alcohol and i spent several years in this. i feel like it was a time bomb, and, one day… boom. my first panic attack. it was a time that i was into cocaine and using it pretty much, every week. after that, i haven’t touched any synthetic drugs, even though i’m still pretty addicted to marijuana. one month after, i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. things were never the same.i got treatment, i got therapy, i had medicine, i tried to exercise, i tried to stop smoking pot and cigarettes. i tried pretty much what people tell us to do, but i failed in everything. from then on, every shit that happened to me seemed to hurt like 10x more. i broke up with a lot of people since then. even with all of this, i always tried to help my friends, all of them have similar problems, one of them even told me i saved his live with support during a anxiety attack. but i feel like nobody give a fuck about me. nobody ask how am i doing. nothing. not even a message.i got dispensed from my job after disagreements with my toxic disgusting fucking boss. and, last year, i decided to take my money and make my first travel outside the country, just by myself. surprisingly, in the middle of the darkness, i had the most legitimate moment of happiness i ever had. i spent 1 month around the coast of california. the 3 weeks i had in san diego were just magical. i met so many wonderful people and felt so welcomed. but, as it ended and i found myself in my mediocre life again, my happiness ended also.it has been rough, rough times. in the last 19 months i lost everything. at least, the little i still had. i broke up with basically all of my friends. i lost confidence. i feel like i can’t get outside my bedroom without being anxious. i’m terrified by panic attacks. i started to fear life and the outside world. i lost all interest in hobbies i once had. i lost my family because, in my head, my stepfather stole it from me. i lost the job i still had because of depression']\n",

(same thing with relationships but thats another story altogether...) my experience has been the opposite.i always knew what i wanted to do with my life. since i was about 10 or 11. its difficult to have discovered your passion so young (or at all, i believe). its funny how certainty can breed frustration in that way. everything else has changed entirely - even my very body and mind - except for that one thing.it can be comforting at times, for sure. sometimes when im surrounded by turmoil it can be nice to listen to the songs i loved when i was young. its effectively just like stepping in a time machine and travelling back there but without having to deal with all the painful parts of the past.im grateful for that indeed, but as i said, its hard having a constant thread in life. its exhausting and very often disappointing. being passionate about something (or some*one* for that matter) makes you really vulnerable to being hurt. im not just referring to criticism, be it internal or external... its like being naked and exposed in a way. its as if you have no way of covering up or protecting yourself because that would be to erase the fact that you are passionate. its kinda like the end of the trial - pink floyd. having a passion or enthusiasm for something is like the judge and the crowd yelling \"tear down the wall! tear down the wall!\" but all of it being completely silent and only inside your own head.now obviously this will sound like a complete exaggeration to most. im aware of that. i dont know if this is something unique to the modern world or if it always existed, but i feel like people who care alot about one thing are alienated. youre supposed to be well balanced in your interests and if not then youre just \"weird\". nobody likes to hear about one thing for any length of time or think about it deeply. after a certain point its \"enough now\" and onwards to the next thing. and i just get the impression that everyone is always skipping the track right before the really good part starts!but anyway, it doesnt really matter what others think or say. most passionate people are their own worst critics. even if you were in a room full of people praising you, it would still be possible to feel like a failure. fulfillment can only ever come from within and its a bloody difficult thing to achieve.i know that the only way to do that is to accept what you have and what you are. gratitude is also helpful, not just for the blessing but for the obstacles too. but why is it so hard to be supportive of and encouraging to myself? it comes so easily towards others, what makes me different?i know that thats a pretty standard experience in depressed people. i have made alot of progress in encouraging myself in other areas of life. however when it comes to my main interest i still struggle to feel adequate and worthy.i think one of the main reasons is that most people often put their younger selves down and dismiss who they used to be. theyre too afraid to empathise with their past selves. instead they call them naïve, immature or just plain stupid. but i dont do that. not anymore at least. i can laugh at my younger self, definitely! but i never belittle, insult or demean my past selves. theyre still a part of me after all. back then i did the best i could with what i knew at the time and i have to respect that.i feel really good when i notice something that would make my younger self feel proud. each time that i accomplish something that i only ever dreamed of doing before, it just fills my heart right up. :) thats why i trust the instincts i had as a kid. after all i did, amongst some other things, have fantastic taste in music for a 13 year old.if that little girl could meet me as i am now, i reckon shed think im pretty cool. that means alot to me. all the thoughts and feelings in my head right now would make no sense to her whatsoever. shed definitely love my tattoo as well. i definitely feel a sense of responsibility to make her proud because i had a really difficult, really shitty childhood. my depression']\n",

      "['i used to be happy a few years ago - was smart, funny, fit and extroverted and even had my fair share of fun in relationships. i was confident, passionate, creative, enjoyed networking and had a great career ahead. but now - career going nowhere, not even close to fulfilling my potential and losing interest in work (which means constant stress and anxiety). also lacking the confidence to make any changes, mainly because i have pretty much lost my life outside of work - no friends left, lost my social skills, and the youthful bravado, fire and passion i had before. how do i go about rediscovering my old self? how do i find some sort of joy and hope to get better in life? at least can someone relate and share their experiences? **here’s what happened:** i had a series of bad jobs with toxic work environments in the last few years. this meant extra hours in the evenings and weekends cleaning up after others’ mistakes, and even when i was free i would be mentally and emotionally drained to face my friends. i began to isolate myself and slowly my support group thinned and disappeared (i myself even pushed some away due to growing shame). i was also repeatedly passed over for recognition and promotion despite giving *so, so much* to work (to be honest, much more than what my colleagues did) and i got absolutely nothing in return. which means that today i am far short of my potential. i’m stuck in yet another job around people who don’t know much about anything (nor do they care) while my ex-colleagues have progressed in their careers to high-paying jobs and influential, valuable networks. this unfairness frustrates and demoralises me and makes me question why i’m even bothering in life. what got me through the tough times in the previous jobs was spending time with my old friends and support groups, and my interests outside of work. i kept reminding myself that it was \"just a job\", and the real joy was in doing my own things i was passionate about like startups, tech, gadgets, photography, games, and music. but i’ve got no friends or support groups anymore, i’ve even become a stranger in the interest groups i used to be part of. it kills me to realise that while my interests got sucked out by work, others who may have been less gifted have kept at it and made a name for themselves as influential in these circles. my physical fitness also has nosedived, with bad habits like smoking, alcohol, junk food, junk online content and porn. my appearance is shabby — i even skip shower and shaving some days. i’ve tried to go out and make new friends from scratch but as it is this is difficult at my age. and with my sense of humour and social skills becoming almost non-existent after going through the last few years’ experiences, im finding it near impossible to be jovial or even smile. i’ve tried online dating sites and tinder for relationships but have found no luck (i’m average looking). heck i can’t even look at a girl now due to the shame i feel when i think how less experienced and fun i might be than guys 10 years younger than me. and no, it doesn’t help to say sign up for an activity that i like doing because like i said, i’ve lost interest in most things. i can’t even seem to relax and find a few minutes to take my mind off work and watch a tv show or something without feeling stressed and anxious about my future.  i’ve thought of  changing jobs again and even saw some really good positions i would be great for, but can’t muster up the confidence to go through the job search. and besides, what if the next one is even worse? i even thought of doing my own thing outside work and network around to freelance or start something up on my own. i’m good at convincing people and selling myself when i’m inspired and when i have belief in my capabilities but my low self-esteem and self-doubt is proving to be a mental block.how do i get out of thus rut and back on my feet? how do i improve myself at work, and at the same time find hope and joy in other things before i spiral into a hole i can’t get out of? how do find joy and live happily and free of fear, anxiety and depression']\n",

      "['i was diagnosed with depression and ocd back in late-2015. my parents were really supportive and caring and i got help quickly.  at the time i was a junior in college, and my university had an amazing psychiatrist that i met with that helped me find therapy and medication. i was dedicated with it, regularly taking my meds and never missing a therapy session, which overall ended that june once school ended. after that i felt good for a time. i felt like i could handle everything well enough, and i started cutting back on my meds, i had a surplus going of them, and i never made an appointment with my psychiatrist to get my prescription refilled. i didnt feel like i needed them. right around the time i graduated college in march and moved back in with my parents i felt the symptoms of depression coming back. i still had some pills left, and i started taking them, but they quickly ran out. im living with my parents back in my home state and im attending grad school for teaching. ive become shy again and find it hard to talk to people in my class. im self-doubting to the point that some of my professors have pointed it out, and a lot of days i just feel sad without much reason. i find it hard again to see the good coming around the corner; all i see is my life being stressful and sad from here on out.  i keep feeling like if i dont get this depression']\n",

      "['i was pretty miserable.  i had just moved back to my parents home after doing a 4-year stint in another city (which i did after getting out of a mental hospital, thinking that by moving away i could \"start fresh\").  i was so depressed that i could barely talk.i had just gotten back from a friends wedding in another city, where i basically drank wine like it was water and passed out drunk next to a port-a-potty, fairly early in the night.  i was sure that i was going to kill myself soon.  absolutely, positively certain.i remember my mom driving me somewhere, and she just broke down crying, saying that i needed to get a job.  i couldnt even say anything to that.  here i was, 28 years old, unemployed, living at my parents with a broken brain that wouldnt stop telling me how much i suck and how ill never get better.id tried like every antidepressant out there.  i felt like my depression was stronger than any antidepressant.  like those were for normal people who get sad.  i felt almost too smart for antidepressants, like the way that they actually work is all placebo effect and i dont fall for that kind of thing.this was like my 8th major depressive episode, by the way.  id already been hospitalized 4 times by this point.  and one of those times, the hospitalization actually made me feel better, and i came out full of confidence, which resulted in me moving away from my hometown, which resulted, eventually, in everything falling apart in a city where i barely knew anyone.  i remember crying on my way home from work for almost an entire winter.anyway, i was drifting.  i had nothing to do and i was terrified of every social interaction.  i forget who found it, me or my parents, but i read that nih in the dc area was doing a study on ketamine as an antidepressant.  id done ketamine before, and i actually remembered that it made me feel euphoric for a couple of months (after a weekends worth of use).  i called, and was accepted.so i moved up to bethesda, md.  i was in a hospital ward, but it wasnt locked or anything.  in fact, i did a lot of sightseeing, eventually.  in the beginning all i did was stay in my room and watch netflix.  i didnt even talk to anyone else.  people there thought i was standoffish, i later learned.i had to get weaned off my medications first for the ketamine trial.  that took like 6 weeks.  i didnt feel any different, helping to strengthen my suspicion that the medicines i was on didnt actually do anything.  i also got my brain scanned a few times, which involved sitting for a really long time inside an mri tube and not moving.  once i fell asleep in there.then the trial!  well, maybe.  it was an experiment where they gave you 2 infusions: one is actually ketamine, the other is placebo (saline, i think).but i got k the first time.  of course i cant say that with 100% certainty, because they never revealed which was which, but i was seeing shapes and colors and trails and was saying that i couldnt control my mouth and words were being spoken through me rather than by me.  the second time i felt nothing at all, so judge for yourself.however, even though i experienced the k, i didnt actually feel better.  i only started to feel better when they put me on zyprexa, which amazingly stopped my social anxiety.  then i started talking to other people in the trial, and making some friends.  i was still depressed but was functional.i went home around thanksgiving.  i had started running and cooking while at nih, and tried to keep that up at home.  i wasnt happy, but i was talking, and that was a start.  i was still basically a nervous wreck, but i got an interview for a coding job, did really well, and got the job (for some reason im never nervous at interviews).  i spent the first month at that job almost puking from anxiety every day, but i made some friends with the smokers, and i realized that it wasnt so bad.  plus it was easy.  plus i could move into my own place now!but i still wasnt happy.  however, one of the other people from the ketamine clinical trial apparently had wonderful results with k and started http://www.ketamineadvocacynetwork.org/ to promote its use as an antidepressant.  i found a doctor near me who administered it, and called him up.  when he heard i was in the clinical trial, he set me up with an appointment (i guess because id basically been pre-screened by the government).i got a series of 5 infusions.  each time i tripped balls.  i mean, ive done drugs, but this was about as wild as it gets.  however, it was different from other experiences, in that i felt like i could experience my mind from outside of itself.  like i could analyze it without judgement, and change it without fear.right after the first infusion, i felt a burst of energy and went running (when i got home).  the next day, everything felt lighter, easier, like it was a game.  these feelings intensified after each infusion, and i gradually thought i had a \"cheat code\" for life.this seems appropriate; its from an interview with donald glover:> glover said that he thinks of reality as a program and his talent as hacking the code: “i learn fast—i figured out the algorithm.” grasping the machine’s logic had risks. “when people become depressed and kill themselves, it’s because all they see is the algorithm, the loop,” he said. but it was also exhilarating. when he was ten, he said, “i realized, if i want to be good at p.e., i have to be good at basketball. so i went home and shot baskets in our driveway for six hours, until my mother called me in. the next day, i was good enough that you wouldn’t notice i was bad. and i realized my superpower.”anyway, that was about 4 years ago.  i now have a prescription for ketamine, which i take at maintenance levels.  ive gone through a lot of bad shit in those 4 years, but ive taught myself how to become resilient (the trick is to go through bad stuff a lot...bend but dont break).  i try to help other people by facilitating dbsa meetings and talking about my life.  i also started volunteering at habitat for humanity because physical effort is good and its good karma.my life isnt perfect.  im not dating anyone, and im worried that its a bad idea to date me because in the past ive fallen into depressions']\n",

      "['i need it many, many times.the brain has remarkable plasticity.  its ability to reorganize and make entire neural networks switch functions is well-demonstrated.depression is a pattern that is crystallized in neural circuits.  its like a computer program: do x, feel bad.  see x, feel bad.  remember x, feel bad.  and triggering those \"feel bad\" circuits leads to chemical releases that inhibit the ability to feel good.  thoughts create mood, and mood then influences thoughts.in prolonged depressions, everything becomes a trigger to feel bad.  for me, its coming home to a messy place, all alone.  ill then start to think \"i should clean\" and immediately feel worse for multiple reasons: i have no reason to clean because i never invite anyone over.  im a bad person because im so lazy i dont clean.  im going to kill myself anyway, eventually, so theres no reason to clean.but i have this gift that is incredibly rare: the ability to inspect and re-route my own thoughts.  so i say, these thoughts are doing me no good.  i have tried these thoughts and they made things worse.  so im going to let the thoughts pass, and then actually clean my place.it may make me feel better.  it may not.  (spoiler: it did).  but knowing that im not a slave to the patterns of thought that i gravitate towards helps me.tomorrow, i can be a different person.  i will wake up with time to spare, put on nice clothes, go to work, and talk to people.  it might not feel like me, but who cares, i dont really enjoy that me anyway.  ill enjoy being this other, new me.  as long as i act consciously, i can choose how to act.  i can pretend like i know that things are getting better, and ill keep pretending until they actually are getting better.i dont have to be the same me i was today.  i have no obligation to maintain my personality.  im free to choose.and i know that this advice only applies to some of you right now.  there were points in my depression']\n",

      "['i have ocd. the rest is useful to read but you dont necessarily need to.** please, anythings appreciated. my online friend who lives a few hours away has had a hard life, depression and suicidal thoughts. shes already attempted suicide at one point in the past, although i dont know details. in her adult life shes only ever met people who have either outright rejected her when they found out she had this illness, or treated her differently because of it. in meeting her online, ive become her *only* support system for this horrible illness. she doesnt know any good irl friends, and her boyfriend, though seemingly genuinely a great guy in all other respects, has deep-seated problems with talking about mental illness. she cuts herself and although meeting me has helped her because i treat her the way she should be treated, i think she would benefit a lot from a bigger support system, and treatment for depression.the first problem with this is that shes become incredibly wary of telling people about her depression, understandably, and sees herself as nothing but a waste of space who deserves to die. shes told me that it would be extremely unfair to introduce people to her problems because she has an \"expiration date\", and that shes going to be sad for the rest of her life anyway and theres nothing she can do about it. she hopes she dies so she doesnt suffer more, and she doesnt want to make other people suffer by telling them. she has a huge discord that she runs where shes friends with all the regulars there, except they dont know. if she told them, they would completely, 100% support her, but again, see above. her boyfriend is the same problem, see above.the second problem is that she needs treatment. pills, therapy, but a) she has ocd about money, and shes poor-ish. even if she didnt think it was a waste to pay for treatment in the first place, her ocd makes it so that she has a hard time spending large amounts of money. she doesnt even look at her bank account half the time because it upsets this part of her. i have ocd myself and this isnt an easy thing to overcome. also, b), i dont know what resources she could potentially access that would be free or cheap.i will take *any* advice, help or resources. she lives in south carolina, if that helps. she and i talk pretty much all day every day except when i work, and although i genuinely love talking to her as much as we do, shes incredible in every way, i feel like the only way shes going to get better past what i can help with by being there, is if she opens up to more people, makes that connection, especially with her boyfriend, and seeks treatment. but i dont know how to do any of those things without forcing her, even though i have brought them up multiple times. these issues are too big for me alone to be able to remedy, i think, even if i can help her by being there for her in the now.please, depressed people, friends of depressed people, *anybody*, i will take any assistance or guidance. i just want to help her live the good life she deserves to live because i love her.-----------------------------------------------------------so i have an online friend who has depression and suicidal thoughts/tendencies, on top of having a hard life in the past and obsessive compulsive tendencies.im ocd myself, but even though ive never really been truly happy with my life to any degree until like this year, and ive been *depressed* for really long periods, i have scars on my arms, the whole deal, i dont believe i have clinical depress*ion*. but my reason for asking for help goes a bit deeper than that.**this will be sort of long, but bear with me please**, im sorry. i really could use some advice and resources.the situation is that i met her probably a month or more ago online through a discord. we just really started hitting it off and although i normally shy away from excessive conversation with new people i meet, ive been in a rough patch the last few months myself and i wasnt really thinking about it.the reason i try not to do that is because i have emotional dependent tendencies. ive self regulated since ive realized i had them, and they dont really show up anymore, but multiple times in my life, to varying degrees of severity, ive become emotionally dependent on someone.so we started talking more and more and since those first few days, we have literally been talking all day every day. now, obviously, this sounds fucking horrible because again, i have the history of dependency (one time it happened was literally with an online friend where we talked 100% of the time), and shes depressed.but the reason weve been doing this is because she *needs* it, from what i can gather. i learned very quickly into us talking about random stuff that she has shitty family, depression, she mentioned her boyfriend hiding sharp objects from her and i mean, hey, i self harmed before, so i offered to help if she needed someone to talk to about that, and now its a whole thing. long story short she grew up in a *horrible* family situation and was mostly isolated from anyone she could ever confide in and trust as a person. in addition to that, shes 20 and somehow every single friend shes met in her adult life has either treated her differently once theyve learned she has the thoughts she does, or left her entirely. fake friends. its *really* fucked up and i honestly dont know how that even could have happened. i feel so bad for her.the only exception is her boyfriend, who she says is a loving, wonderful person - except hes deathly allergic to talking about mental illness. she thinks this is because *his* family was/is also shitty, and hes always just had trouble with that sort of issue. it makes him uncomfortable and he doesnt know how to deal with it. i realize that doesnt make him sound like a good person at all, but i think shes self aware enough that she would know if she was in an actually abusive/bad relationship. i honestly believe her when she says hes a good person (to the degree he can be with this in mind, whatever), but that doesnt change the fact that even *he* doesnt help her with this stuff, despite him knowing. and shes too...shes not a docile person, but shes very cautious about talking about mental illness. this isnt the kind of thing she would feel comfortable bringing up again to him.*so with all of this in mind*, after knowing this girl for maybe a month and a half, ive become her *only* support system.you do not have to remind me how absolutely horrible of an idea it is for someone to only have *one* person as a mental health support system, but the thing is, i dont know what to do. thats why im making this post, and why i felt all that context was necessary.im too tired to format this better, but as an aside, *no*, i have not developed an emotional dependency on her. ive taken steps mentally to not do that and i just want to make it clear that honestly, shes just a new friend to me, who just happens to need help on a regular basis. im not going to deny her that help.i mean, this girl is *literally the nicest person ive ever met*. like, i genuinely dont even think she has any bad qualities whatsoever. shes funny, sweet, caring...shes amazing. i genuinely enjoy talking to her as much as i do. i find it shocking she, of all people in the world, could think that anything is wrong with her. i could go on for hours. shes just so pure and good.so i talk to her and be a good friend, which is really what she needs in life in general - she tells me a lot how she doesnt think im even real because im so nice, but im honestly just acting like normal me and doing what any good person would. like i said, shes met bad, shitty people, and i care about her. so when she tells me that shes not real, or shes nothing but a waste of space who deserves to die, or that shes this terrible monster whos a burden just by existing and she should just jump off her balcony right now, i comfort her and help her. or i try to. the wall im running into, which i shouldve realized slightly sooner, is that there is only so much i *can* help. i have ocd, so my mentality subconsciously is to try and straight up *fix* problems, and ive realized i have a big tendency to try and make her feel better explicitly, instead of just talking to her like i would anyone else. it isnt necessarily *bad*, but i know that overdoing it would be, and i dont want to do that. i just want to help, but even when i do my best, sometimes it just doesnt affect her whatsoever and all i can do is be there for her. we watch movies on rabbit sometimes and were planning voice chats and stuff, but.the final bit of context here is that she owns the discord we met on. its a community full of people from different places, and shes friends with practically all of them. but her isolation is in that she feels uncomfortable telling people about her depression']\n",

      "['i just couldnt stop writing. it was therapeutic. if you do take the time to read it, i appreciate it. have a nice night everyone.* so as i’m on my way to my grandfather’s house for easter dinner, i’m just zoned out and staring out the window thinking to myself “just not today.. i’m tired and i don’t want to do this”..i know that everyone will be there, and they’ll all bring their boyfriends and girlfriends, they‘ll talk cute to each other, tell a story at the same time, adding in slightly more details, and hold hands under the table.. just the little things that remind you that you’re not in this alone..as i was about to walk in and prepared my best “everything is awesome” face and walked in with a smile, acting excited to be there. i even felt a little guilty for feeling this way; i am lucky to have a nice family..by now i’ve made my rounds and settle into the recliner in the living room with everyone else, having a few beers and listening to everyone talk.. i’m not saying much.. you know in movies when a bomb goes off or something, and it’s just that silence except for the slight ringing.. it was kind of like thatmy cousin and his girlfriend are holding hands sitting on the couch.. not in a pda type of way, but in a very loving way.. i really believe she was happy to be spending the day with him. she laughed at his jokes, they joked around and she’d hit him (playfully) whenever he said anything inappropriate.. i miss that then my little cousin walks in and he’s looking at my phone. i let him play with it and he is just in absolute aww; fascinated. he thinks siri is the most amazing thing, and he’s talking about how cool it was..what happened to that in my life? i miss being in complete aww, just taking in a moment of beauty.. you know what i see with a phone.. a bill.. a reminder that no one’s texted me, an outlet that means you are connected to the world, 24/7, never getting a break.. i check it.. no matches on tinder either aha why the fuck did i even sign up for that?..it comes time for dinner and we had your favorite.. cooked ham with that string bean casserole my aunt makes. it wasn’t as good as the years passed, but i think it was only because you weren’t there to remind me how good it was.. you would have psyched because i think she even added extra onion straws we’re eating around the table and i’m sitting at the head, because everyone wanted to sit next to their so’s, and there was only one chair at the end.. i volunteer as tribute, because why not? let them enjoy the time.. i know it’s not that big a deal, and they wouldn’t even mind, but things just happened that way..i think that’s where i made the mistake.. pretty much just asking to be talked to by those relatives who i only see three times a year..then it happened.. i hadn’t seen or talked to these relatives in a long time“hey dugefrsh, where’s [my girlfriend]? at her parents today? i made extra casserole just for her!”it’s kind of cliche to say especially because people say it a lot.. but it was like a scene from a movie..the kitchen becomes pretty quiet and she could tell she messed up and gave me a sad look to say i’m sorry. how was she supposed to know? it’s okayi play it off and just smile “ haha she’s doing well, her and her mother are on vacation this week i believe, so they’re out of state”the sigh of brief relief that swept over her face didn’t last long and she kept asking about her and telling me how cute she was and how she was so much fun to talk to..the line that hurt most was when she said she fit in perfect with our family..“she was perfect i know aunty”and it’s sort of my fault too i guess, i could have just told her that we’re not together anymore and been done with it, but i didn’t want to embarrass her finally my dad coughed and i told her we were no longer seeing each other anymore..play it off coy, everyone gets back to chatting and the situation rolls over.. i don’t usually drink a red wine, but we were out of white and i didn’t want a beer. i sat there at the head of the table playing with a bowl of jellybeans, and i even picked out all the black ones and put them off to the side, sort of like i was saving them for you.. i can’t believe you liked those you weirdo hahai finally had a moment without thinking about you today though.. the bruins game was on and was a welcome distraction; that and the alcohol was helpingwhen the game finishes up all the kids want to watch frozen.. i can’t do that..when i would sing do you wanna build a snowman to you and you’d laugh.. i can’t do it..thankfully though my parents wanted to leave.. as i’m in the back seat again, the pulsing of the passing street lamps make it a little hard to close my eyes.. when i’m staring at the stars, it’s such a lame, grandiose and romanticized way of thinking, but i knew they were the same stars that you were looking at.. it hit me that that was one time i was in aww.. looking at stars with you..after i finish this drink, i’m gonna try and get some rest though..if i’m lucky i’ll just pass out and don’t have to cry too long..maybe i’ll start the moving on process?.. it’s never taken me this long to get over someone..maybe i’ll try it in the morning.. maybe tomorrow will be the day i beat this stupid depression']\n",

      "['i decided to post here and see what happens. lets talk!  so the reason why im posting here in mental health is that my supposed egoism plays a big role in my interactions with others and feels pretty unnatural so i have a feeling it has to do something with my mental health. let me elaborate a bit. recently i started feeling very egoistic. while not entirely sure about the reasons for it, i think there always was a bit of egoism in me since early childhood, and it is only now that i started coming to terms with it. the realization was pretty painful, but then i also realized this egoism of mine actually makes life much easier- whenever i talk with others i tend to concentrate on my thoughts and feelings, and myself in general - trying to connect the dots in order to understand my own problems better, applying their situations and problems to mine, and so on.- i find it pretty hard to remember stuff about other people, even when they tell me the same thing several times. they often get angry when they find out i dont remember anything. at the same time, remembering my own problems is not a problem at all.- i am somewhat afraid of serious relationships. this is a serious and strange topic, a problem that surfaced only recently - ive always wished to be in a long, stable romantic relationship and to have deep, meaningful friendships, but now find it almost impossible to dive in either of those. keeping many surface relationships is much easier and more comfortable for me for some reason, even though i somehow feel its not my natural state. - my family relationships are fucked. home is where i am the most egoistic i couldve ever imagined. i just stopped to care about these people and only do the bare minimum now to sustain whats left. it hurts, because i know my family loves me very much and would sacrifice anything for my happiness, however i just dont want to be around them anymore and feel pretty depressed']\n",

      "['i feel like she doesnt care, im saying this because of various reasons, like: when i had my very first mental breakdown and spent 15 days crying in bed and sleeping without moving the only thing she did was telling me \"think about starving kids in africa theyre doing worst than you\" and then put the dog on my bed instead of conforting me herself. at that point i asked her to see a therapist. she allowed me to do that but, like she always does, she started to make me feel extremely guilty about the fact that we couldnt afford even that upon the other expences and telling me things like \"we have to pay your therapist so i dont know if well have money to go grocery shopping\". we had money for both since my father a month later bought a fucking vehicle for 3.000€, but still. shes always been like that.at first i though she didnt know what to do with depression and how to deal with someone who is depressed (which is very strange, considering her older brother passed away in an accident when she was around my age, which is 21/22, and that is the kind of thing that would probably make you feel depressed i guess), so i just forgave her and tried to pick myself up the best i could. then my brother had his breakdown, started hearing voices that werent there, stopped sleeping, started yelling in the middle of the night and writing stuff on the walls with a pen. of course my anxiety at this point got super bad, cause thing were basically falling apart with my ex, i had to give exams, i couldnt function and i was waking up at seven am by my mother who asked me to scrape off the words my brother wrote on the walls \"as quietly as you can\". i did. while having and anxiety crisis all the time i spent on the wall with a sponge erasing threats against every single member of my family of \"gutting us like animals\". then she became, like, *the best mum ever.* always there to give him support, always rushing over him and worrying, asking him stuff, trying her best to be close to him. and i got so mad, cause she was capable of being next to my brother, then why did she teated me the way she did in the past? then i realized. of course she didnt stayed close to me when i was ill: everything was going great with her. she only worried about me when she needed comfort and if i couldnt provide that because i was sick then she would \"worry\" (by which i mean making me feel guilty because i couldnt take no more). i went to live with my grandma for january cause i was super done with dying in anxiety and crying three hours per day when i wad okay, i needed a place to stay calm or i would just go insane. she helped me pack and gave me the key of the car, told me to have a \"nice trip\" and went back inside to check my brother.i went to my grandmas house crying hysterically and i didnt stop for hours. i just cried and cried until i was too exhausted and i slept. the morning after i told my ex-boyfriend that i was way too depressed to get out of bed and i couldnt see him and i was very sorry. he got angry (yeah, he was emotionally abusive as fuck, maybe one day ill write the story but he fucked me up pretty badly mentally), and i just shutted my phone up, got into bed and started writing suicide notes to my friends and my grandma. once i finished i realized that i couldnt go to the bathroom, let alone go to the top of a building and jump off.so i decide that i need medicine and i need therapy asap. where i live we have free healthcare, so i ask my mum to come with me to take the appointment with the psychiatrist. he saw me, diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and we started with medicines.my mum never asked me how it was. she never asks about medicines, my health, how im doing. the medicine arent working still and i never took that many pills in a lifetime, but she doesnt even notice that. she discovered i wad being medicated when i told my older brother about it in the living room and she reacted with a \"okay\". just an okay.i told her my diagnosis when i was hysterically crying because i just broke things off with my ex and she kept talking to me about what my father did that day that was *so wrong and shitty * she just didnt care that i was sobbing in the car next to her. what she told me? \"oh you think *im* not depressed?\"then just kept on telling me how bad she was feeling and how life was cruel to her.meanwhile here i am, all alone at 21 years of age, with basically nothing cause my parents managed to burn down every single piece of property they couldve left to us, with a broken brain since i was so little i litteraly cannot remember when it started precisely, five attempted suicides. and my mum just wants to talk about how she fucked up her own life and she feels miserable about it. after i told my psychiatrist this he told me to go live to my grandmas, because my house was way too toxic and i could never improve there. i kept staying there for a while cause i felt guilty about living my brothers and my mum alone, but then my little brother (the one that probably has schizophrenia, but nobody in my family is willing to accept the problem and do something about it) almost punched me in the face because i asked him how he was doing.i am very petite girl with zero muscles cause i hate sports, my brother has harms as big as my head basically. he couldve busted badly my face in a matter of seconds, but luckly for me i have good reflexes, so i avoided it for the most part. he bruised my face though.i told my mum what happened via text and she didnt reply. she didnt say anything. than she said that i should be patient with my brother whom is *very sick and very angry.* that was the day i moved into my grandmas house and my mum thinks it is only because i am mad at her for no reason. like my whole life revolves around how she feels and what she wants. because she taught me that i can never feel bad or sad or angry when she is, she is the important one that needs to talk. i am the one that is supposed to listen to her problems since i was in elementary school. she litteraly took me from class when i was 8 to show me how badly my father punched her in the face. im sorry for the long posts, but i have a lot of shit im going through and im basically quitting every relationship with my mum whatsoever because of this. i just need her to give me money, cause she is supposed to and she promised me and i am in uni and cannot work because of my depression (my psychiatrist basically begged me not to find a job cause it would only make me feel worst). when ill feel better i will work my butt of and be indipendent and never speak to her ever again. but the fact is that i am dropping someone that to me was my *hero.* i love my mum so much, she can be kind and amazing and she protected me when my father wanted to kick the shit out of me, she tried to raise me alone the best she could and i just cant leave her behind without feeling like i have lost everything in my life. i feel like i hav nothing and i need to build an empire all by myself without the help of anybody, while having no arms and no idea of how to build said empire. everyday i think that dying would be the best option, but i cant die, i promised my best friend we would climb mount depression together and get to the top together.i just feel stuck in life. everyone that shouldve loved me no matter what just disappointed me again and again. my mum broke me to pieces and she doesnt even care. she has two sons and a doll that she can use however she wants, thats it. it sucks. it feels shitty to know that the person that choose to put you into this world just left you completely alone and was never there when you really needed that. now all she does is call me from time to time and tries to make me feel guilty about not helping her in our house and wanting to be here to do nothing. she knows i am depressed']\n",

      "['i don’t know if anybody will read all of this but it’s worth a try even if it helps me to get it out in words because it’s a mess inside my head. in october i went to a thanksgiving dinner 30 minutes away from home to my dad’s friends house. the people that were there were me, my sisters, my dad, my aunt and uncle (whom i don’t see very often) and my dad’s friend. i remember saying to myself that i didn’t want to go. at all. with my anxiety currently, being that far away from home without a quick escape (as it was 30 minutes away) then it made it harder. i wanted to make my dad proud and actually go to a family gathering for once so i sucked it up. the drive i was anxious but still able to be calm. i didn’t eat before going and i didn’t get a good amount of sleep the night before which is a precursor to trigger my anxiety. i should have stayed home. it was too much too soon. when we go there is when the anxiety kicked in. i knew i would get asked about my mom and how were getting along and i’d have to talk about it. she left the house in the summer of 2015 after her and my dad weren’t getting along and we thought it was best she leave due to her emotional abuse and narcissistic tendencies. it did not go well. she accused us of kicking her out when her father was the one who took her out of the house. anyways i think talking about my mom just made my anxiety worse. i could feel the anxiety rising and the thoughts start. “what if i get sick here in front of all these people?” “what if they think i’m weird for having a panic attack?” only a hour there and i wanted to tell my dad to drive me home. i didn’t because i couldn’t be weak again and just go home. i also didn’t want my dad to get mad and to ruin his time like i’ve done before. i sat on the couch and had a full panic attack. people know to leave my alone when i get like this. when im anxious i freeze up and can’t talk. i can only focus on one thing like a tv show. my sisters would come up and talk to me but another thing when i get anxious is my throat feels like its’ closing and i gag. i didn’t want them to see me do this. i would just nod and pretend i was okay. i couldn’t even think of dinner and having to eat in front of everyone. i just sucked it up while i could feel myself having what felt like a panic attack then it would subside then start up and then subside then start up. like hills or mountains. peaks and valleys. the best way i can describe it. absolute hell. i felt trapped with no way out and so far away from home. i remember going to the bathroom even though i hate going in other people’s houses. praying it wasn’t a bad poop (which would lead me to think i was sick and trigger my emetophobia) it was fine so that eased my mind. i ate what i could. some turkey and potatoes with a fake smile on my face, nodding and trying to converse all while feeling like my body was exploding on the inside from all the anxiety and adrenaline. again i’d be okay for a short while then it would spike. peaks and valleys. again, best way to describe it. it was finally winding down and my dad wanted to stay longer but i said “fuck no. i need to go home now.” on the drive home all i could think about was the anxiety. i’m literally having anxiety right now typing this just thinking about it. i was scared i was gonna throw up or faint or have a heart attack. dad was talking to me but all i was focused on was my anxiety and my body. i just wanted to get home to my room. i gagged violently in the car as my throat felt tight and my mouth dry. this would happen whenever my anxiety gets so intense. it was pretty bad when i was a kid. when we got home i had the worse depersonalization ever. my room looked foreign. i felt like i was in a daze. i assume my brain was overloading from all the anxiety. this only made it worse. i went to the bathroom and changed into my pyjamas and i laid down, put my computer and tv on and rode it out. that night was when it all started. the next day i had what i call a “panic attack hangover” i felt so tired, my muscles were tense. i slept horrible. waking up every so often with my heart racing in the middle of a anxiety attack. it’s like my body was full of adrenaline still. i was happy to be in my bed and my comfort zone when this was happening. my bedroom has been my safe haven for the past couple of years where i felt safe when i was anxious. my dad made food for dinner and even though anxiety, which depletes my appetite, was still present, i ate. i was still anxious. just wanted my bed and to lay down and watch tv on my laptop with all my comfort. a few hours later i had diarrhea. cue my brain into thinking i had a stomach virus that i caught or got sick from the food the night before. i rationally knew it was from all the anxiety as the anxiety puts my digestive tract into overdrive. i knew that but my irrational brain as i like to call it, didn’t. i was convinced i was sick which then put my anxiety into overdrive once again. all i felt for the next couple days was anxiety. i was scared to eat as maybe i was sick and food would make me throw up. i stuck to my bland diet which i do when i think i’m sick when really it’s anxiety fucking with my head. slowly the anxiety passed after a week. moments like that typically do even though this particular time what with thanksgiving and how bad that experience was, usually last about a week. i had my first therapist appointment on the 26th of october. the anxiety from thanksgiving was gone. i still had the thoughts of “what if” but those were always with my when i left the house. i was excited to start therapy again. the session went good. it was really just to get to know me. what meds im on ect. i told her about thanksgiving and how awful it was. she told me that it was good that i got through it. i agreed but i also thought to myself that i never want to feel that way again.i stopped to get a bagel after and went home. went on the internet and read a book. my sister got home and offered to make us some pasta. i was so tired so i told her if i fall asleep, wake me when it’s ready. i feel asleep so fast without even realizing it. what felt like 2 seconds later my sister woke up me up and told me dinner was ready. i started to feel that anxiety dread again. usually when i take naps in the daytime i wake up a little anxious and groggy. apparently my brain thought it was time to freak out to the extreme because i felt the daze feeling and the depersonalization again. i walked down and got myself some pasta even though it look revolting because once again, my anxiety gets rid of any appetite i have when it rears it’s ugly head. i ate the pasta and turned on netflix and grey’s anatomy. i put on something i’m familiar with when i’m anxious. it’ sort of a weird coping mechanism. i don’t know. this is when it allll started.i spent the night convinced that i woke up feeling like that because i was sick. always go to that conclusion. i hate my brain. i spent all night in and out of panic attacks just like i did during thanksgiving. i thought “oh hell no. i’m not feeling like this again.” and it sort of spiralled from there. i felt everything. afraid to eat because i might get sick which caused more anxiety. loose stools from anxiety even though i know anxiety caused it but more convincing to my irrational brain that i was sick. it wasn’t anxiety. this kept happening. it all snowballed and i wanted it to stop. for some reason i started to feel like i did when i was 13. there was this one point where something like this happened that was similar. i would gag and get afraid to eat. i dry heaved over the sink. my anxiety was awful. my mom was there and she would help and cut me up apples to get me to eat. i would lay on the couch next to her. i started to say “i want my mom.” i thought she would know how to make it better. like she did when i was 13. i do not know where this thought came from. my mom hadn’t lived with us for over year and we barely saw each other. i don’t know why my brain thought that she would fix this. i do remember that when i would say something like “if i eat this i’ll probably throw up or it will come out of me and make me think im sick.” and she would always say “no you’re fine.” and that would help. i ended up fine. my dad and sisters would tell me everything is okay as well but it wasn’t the same. i’m not sure why i felt like my mom would make this better but i did.   i literally felt like i was 13 again and back in that episode i went through. i no longer had control over my thoughts and my body. i was anxious as hell and hated the physical symptoms that came form that and i wanted it all to stop. i think i broke. i was gagging while trying to eat which made me think i was sick. i got scared i was going to get malnourished and have to be tube fed. i would text my mom and she would tell me no, that’s not possible. i would get heart palpitations and think i was having a heart attack. i had a palpitation on the toilet and i was scared of going on the toilet. my stomach was a mess with loose stools due to anxiety but convinced i was sick and then fed on that i wasn’t absorbing my food and i would end up, once again as i mentioned, malnourished and have to be tube fed. i was texting my mom with every symptom i felt. the anxiety  felt like i was losing control of my mind and the symptoms of the anxiety made me feel like i was losing control of my body. i was afraid i was dying or had some sort of disease. i started looking up all these symptoms on google and asking my mom if i had this disease or this condition. i was afraid i was gonna have a heart attack or faint. i couldn’t eat or sleep. it’s like my brain stopped working. i cried. i would try to tell my sisters and dad that i needed my mom. i wanted her back home. all of us together again. they told me no. it’s not healthy. mom and dad don’t get alone anymore. were here and we can help you. mom’s not far away. i told them they don’t help like my mom does. they took offence to that. i got mad and stopped talking to them because they wouldn’t let my mom come home. i felt like a child. i felt out of control. why was i acting like this? i was still feeling all the symptoms of anxiety. still worried i was dying. this never stopped. this scared me. why was i acting like this? was i going crazy? was i having a mental breakdown? i started to do things to get my dad’s attention to see how bad i was without my mom. i remembered i cut myself after being self harm free for over 2 years. at that time i didn’t care. i just wanted to stop this anxiety. my mom suggested that i go to the hospital. i agreed even though i knew i would get traumatized. i went through this when i was 12. i had to go to the hospital and i remember sitting in the waiting room. this was back in 2002 and there was a breakout of some virus that caused vomiting. the norwalk virus i think. i remember my dad took me and while in the waiting room i kept telling him while sobbing that i had to go home. i was gonna catch something here. being at the hospital again this time brought all that back and it was like i was reliving it all again. i felt 12 again. not 27. why? it scared me. at the hospital they gave me 1mg of ativan. explained to them about what was happening what with my anxiety and me thinking i was dying or had a disease. i stayed until the morning and saw the crisis councillor. she explained that parents spilt up and it’s hard and that my mom wasn’t far and i could talk to her or call her on the phone. i felt good hearing that. i felt better. i went home and felt good. i hated that i self harmed though. i hate that i put my dad and sisters through that. i went to sleep feeling good. i can move ahead. nope.i woke up in a panic attack and all the thoughts came back. the health anxiety. the symptoms of anxiety. my thoughts went back to needing my mom again. i started acting out and throwing things to get my dad to see i wasn’t okay and needed my mom. why was i acting like this? i felt confused and scared and my thoughts made no sense. i couldn’t think or make decisions. i couldn’t calm down. i was having panic attack and i couldn’t eat or sleep. i was googling all my symptoms from anxiety and diagnosing myself with everything.i needed my mom like i had when i was 13 and this would stop. my mom decided to come over and stay a few nights. it was awful. i was till asking her about every symptom. i was gagging at food and scared of malnutrition and she kept saying no. it’s just your anxiety. this time my mom’s words weren’t helping. i’d lost control and i was going to feel like this the rest of my life. i was terrified. i stopped talking to my friends or going on social media. all i thought 24/7 was anxiety, anxiety, anxiety. what illness or disease i could have. the heart palpitations, gagging, not being able to eat, or sleep, diarrhea, sweating, shaking, scared i would faint. it was all i was focused on. i couldn’t focus on tv or movies. i couldn’t read. i couldn’t sit still. the only relief i got was when i went to sleep with the help of my seroquel. while my mom was there it was hell. i wanted to convinced my dad and sisters she could come home. she could sleep on the couch or back in her bed with dad. have it all like it was before. i dont know why i was saying this. my sisters and my dad don’t talk to my mom and her being in the house was tense for all of them. my mom felt uncomfortable there and my sisters didn’t want her there either. my mom had to go back to her parents house where she had been living since she left home and i thought “oh hell no.” she’s staying. i stopped talking and stared at the wall in hopes that my dad and sisters would see that i was bad off and needed my mom. i don’t know why i was doing this but like i said i had lost control of my mind. she had to go and i just laid there begging for them to see. i just cried. my grandparents came to pick her up and my grandfather and my dad don’t get along. they got into a physical altercation a few years prior. i heard yelling and screaming downstairs. my little sister was pissing me off. she kept telling me my mom couldn’t come home and i was being stupid. she called my crazy and all. she was yelling at my mom telling her to leave. i remember getting up and walking downstairs and i punched her in the face. i hate that i did this. we’ve gotten in fights before. we ended up fighting and my dad tore us apart. i remember just flinging myself on the hardwood floor. i felt like i didn’t know why this was happening. my mom left. i went back to my room and cried and still felt the anxiety. i started googling again. i’d post on reddit looking for reassurance that i wasn’t dying. all the while my sisters and dad distances themselves from me. i told them to leave me alone and i hated them when inside i wanted help and i just didn’t know what was wrong with me. i was scared. why was i acting like this? why was i feeling like this? was this is it? was i going crazy? i would look up the symptoms of going crazy. that night i went downstairs and told my dad i was leaving. i wanted my mom and they wouldn’t let me so bye! i didn’t want this i just wanted to know what was happening to me. i put on clothes and packed a bag and i hid in the woods hoping that would get their attention. i sat there for 20 minutes and nobody cared. i remember walking back home and i had a heart palpitation and i thought “no” i can’t have a heart attack and then my anxiety skyrocketed again. it wouldn’t stop. i was in a constant state of fear and anxiety. i felt my body and mind were on high alert. when i got home. i just laid on the floor in the living room. i called my mom over and over and told her nobody was seeing how bad i was. i was calling my grandfather to pick me up so i could go stay with them. my mom kept telling me to wake my dad up and ask him for help. i said no he doesn’t get it. my mind was set that only my mom could fix this. i went upstairs and slammed my door and self harmed again. my dad came in and shook me and screamed at me asking me why i was doing this. i didn’t know. i didn’t know what was happening to me. i just wanted the anxiety to stop. i refused to go to the hospital again and re-traumatize myself for the 3rd time. after that i knew that my mom wasn’t coming home. just wasn’t happening. i was still feeling anxious as hell and googling everything. i was not sleeping well and not eating. the anxiety was awful. i had never felt this anxiety in my life ever. maybe when i was 13 but not as bad. i felt like i was back there again. everyday i was terrified i would throw up or have a heart attack. i was having multiple panic attacks a day. i kept telling my mom i had to get out of this shit hole where nobody cared about me. (they did.) i told my dad he wasnt gonna get my rent. (i’m on disability and i do pay my rent) he got mad. i said fuck this i’m moving out with mom. she looked into it and got us appointment to sign the lease. i thought “okay, mom’s gonna fix me. i’ll feel better.” nope. while waiting for the process, my sisters and dad barely talked to me. i was still scared of throwing up or having a heart attack. i was scared that not eating much would lead me to malnutrition. i was afraid to get up and go to the bathroom or take a bath because i didn’t want to get my heart rate up or faint due to not eating much. i was constantly aware of every physical sensation due to the anxiety. i was in a constant state of it and hyper sensitive. i saw my doctor and i was gagging so hard in the office and i thought “fuck fuck why wont this stop.” he prescribed a antacid to take because the anxiety was causing this. i thought it wasn’t and i had some disease. i noticed i’d lost 10 pounds since i was there last in april. this was november. first through was “fuck im malnourished and im gonna end up on a feeding tube” i couldn’t even hold a conversation with him because all i felt was anxiety and i wanted to get out of there.going on social media made me anxious. watching a show i didn’t see before made me anxious. i started getting anxious seeing pictures of people i was friends with and pictured being in public with them and having a anxiety attack. everything was causing a panic attack. the day came to sign the lease. i was focused on living with my mom and not feeling this anxiety hell again. my mom and grandfather were coming to pick me up and the only thing i was thinking of was my anxiety. would i faint because im actively walking and i haven’t eaten? what if i have a heart attack? what if i have palpations? in the car i was focused on my chest and how it was beating. my mom trying to talk to me and me just saying things back. sitting in the lease office only thinking about if i was gonna have a heart attack in front of these people. i was not in the right mindset to be making this huge life change. i signed the lease and only cared about getting home.then something happened. i hoped that the lease wouldn’t go through because the anxiety was starting to lift. i slowly got back to eating. i could sleep. i started talking to my dad again. i felt better. it had passed.my mom texted me and told me we got approved. i wanted to tell her that its okay now. i’m fine. i didn’t. i was scared she would get mad and think that i didn’t want to move in with her. i had dug this hole while anxious and not thinking straight. what did i do? it all became clear to me that my mom is emotionally abusive and anything she does it had to benefit her. it was better we lived apart. i could think properly now. but now i couldn’t let my mom down and do what’ best for me. i told her i was excited. now i’m here. it’s been almost 6 months living with my mom in our two bedroom apartment. i walk on eggshells around her to make sure i don’t do anything wrong to piss her off. she constantly tells me that her kids don’t talk to her and my sisters are bad humans. she asks my dad to help her with money and to bring her things. she’s always asking who i’m talking to and if i’m talking shit about her to my sisters. she yells at me because they don’t talk to her and i being me, have to try to fix it. i just want everyone to get along. she gets mad if i put something back in the fridge the wrong way. her moods can be up and down. im starting to remember why she had to move out in the first place. she can’t be there for me like she was when i was 13. i didn’t realize until now that she was only there so she could look good. that she was the caring mother. when in reality she tells me to stop worrying and get over it. now i’m in this mess and worse then ever. i miss my old home. i went back there and it’s not the same. my dad has a roommate with him. the house looks different and it’s not my home anymore. the day i moved out nobody was home because they didn’t want to see my mom so i never had a proper goodbye to the house or my sisters and dad. i just left. i followed up with my doctor and ekg’s and blood tests and all normal. my health anxiety still hasn’t gone away since that time despite the doctor saying i’m fine.nothing in my life is the same anymore. i feel like a new person. somebody i dont know. i feel like i was just placed here and now i have to learn how to function. my agoraphobia has flared up again. after all the worrying about something being wrong with me is still there. i worry i still have a disease or i’m gonna faint or anything if i leave my room. my surrounding feel foreign. i feel like my world has turned on it’s axis. i don’t see my sisters because they do not get along with my mom so they don’t come over. i can’t leave the house to see them cause of my issues. i miss my dad and how much we got along. he only comes over if i need something but i hate bothering him. we barely talk. he told me that i can call him anytime and he would pick me up. my anxiety is still high when out of my room. i also get flashbacks of that time when i see my sisters or my dad. i associate them with what happened. my anxiety then spikes.i don’t know how to get past this. how did i get here? how do i move forward? i feel like i can’t move from what happened. why did i act like that? what happened? what triggered it? am i crazy? was i crazy? i miss my old life. it wasn’t perfect but now i don’t know who i am anymore. i don’t know what to do. i have good days when my mom’s at work and i’m home alone and i could take a walk or sit on the balcony but i dont because the fear of that anxiety or those anxiety symptoms will come back. i’ve become a recluse in my room. i sit on my bed and watch tv and go on my computer. i only leave my room to eat and bathe. the eating this is still scary. will i gag like i did during that time? am i eating enough so i don’t get malnourished? it’s like all my life is now is what happened in november. i have flashbacks like ptsd. i can’t move on. i’m afraid a panic attack will trigger it all over again so i have avoided doing anything that might cause anxiety or those symptoms because i can’t feel like i did then. i can’t.if somebody took the time to read all this and make me understand exactly what happened, that would help. i’m on waiting list for therapy. i went back to my dads house two weeks ago because i told my mom i wanted to move back. i spent the weekend there. my mom hated me. she told me i was a terrible daughter for abandoning her with the rent and bills. when i was at my dads i was back to feeling like i did back in november. all the feelings came back. all that happened. it also just wasn’t the same. my sisters moved out and it was my dad and some stranger. this wasn’t home anymore. i couldn’t live there. i went back to my apartment with my mom. i feel like i have no control. i feel stuck.i feel depressed']\n",

(i just remember this, but one time she scolded me for being happy and for laughing and said that that wasnt fair to her because she was alone)how can i leave it knowing that she is still suffering and probably will continue to suffer since shes religious and isnt educated about medication or the illness in general. i doubt that she even knows shes depressed']\n",

(this is the combination of anedonias \"nothing matters anyway\" and adhds \"lets flood you with a thousand thoughts and make you forget why you even had the thought in the first place.\")none of this happened. it tried to for a second, then i just said \"fuck it, this is my body, i can make it do these things\" (getting all the stuff out and setting it up), so i started doing it.within an hour i had a song, then another, then another, etc. the next day was the same, i was in chat rooms about music, talking about my hobby oh my god, its my hobby, i have a hobby, a thing i love doing!!!. sorry for the caps, but this realization hit me.its only been a week, but the effects have been stable. im not super excited and hyped up, i can just think of doing something and start doing it. and as im doing it, i dont constantly have this negative voice devaluing what im doing or sapping all the joy out of it. im not plagued by a suicidal cheer leader who wants nothing more than to make me give up and lay there till i die.i say all of this because i know what depression feels like. theres always the chance that ill have to adjust my meds in the future as one med becomes less effective or whatever. all i can say is that for the first time in a while, i feel like hope actually exists in the world.im glad i talked to my psychologist about dealing with adhd. i havent treated adhd since i was a late teen, and i only treated it for a short period of my life. had i not brought up the topic of adulthood adhd, i wouldnt have found out that an antipsychotic medication (haloperidol) could quiet that shitty nagging \"nothing you do matters\" voice in my head and let me reconnect with the things i used to enjoy.i hope whatever your method of action, please believe me when i tell you. ive spent the last 4 years of my life being absolutely certain that depressed or not depressed, joy was a lie i used to tell myself and id somehow figured out that nothing joyful was ever real.here i am, only a week later and its like the heaviest darkest fog has been removed from in front of my eye, or pulled out of my heart.i hope you find the will to keep trying to beat your depression']\n",

      "['i just want to write it down somewhere, maybe it will help. im a college senior in my early 20s. since my teen years, probably starting around 17 or 18, ive been on a rollercoaster of ups and downs, each of which usually last a few months at a time, although it varies. my initial, long ago feelings of depression stemmed from not knowing how to talk or interact with girls, having been a sheltered youth that went to an all boys high school. i went through several years thinking i wasnt good enough for anyone, feeling immense loneliness even though i had plenty of guy friends that truly liked and cared about me.well i finally learned a few years ago kinda how to get girls. and when this happened my rollercoaster went to one of its highest \"ups\" ever. i was meeting and sleeping with girls, finally. i loved it.  last year, i met a girl who became absolutely infatuated with me. she loved and adored me. she told me this numerous times. we were perfectly compatible in bed. perfectly compatible. at the point of meeting her i had already had several partners and she was the first one that made me truly enjoy sex. she desired me. i desired her. the whole time i was \"with\" her (with in quotations because i never dated her, we kinda just texted a lot and had sex on the weekends) i basically treated her like shit. took her for granted. i thought,subconsciously, \"look how much this girl loves and wants me, i must be the shit, i dont really need her cause i can get any girl i want.\" the confidence boost of having someone love me so much and think i was so attractive made me think any girl could feel the same way about me. so after about 9 months, i told her i wanted to stop seeing her.she was devastated. begged me not to go. i said no, were not meant for each other. i didnt see her for 2 months over the summer. i had no girls, and i missed her, but i was still confident in myself. i still thought i was attractive, had a lot to offer. but i missed her. i realized i made a mistake. and i texted her saying so. and she said sorry, but i wasted too much time on you, someone who constantly told me that they didnt love me, so now i started seeing someone else. so now shes gone. its been several months since then, and i havent talked to her since, besides one little hiccup in the middle where we talked for a day, but its irrelevant to this post. i still think about how good i had it, and i still miss her every day, and i always think about how stupid i was to throw it away. in the moment i didnt think i even liked her, but i guess its true that you dont know what you have till its gone. well if this was all i had to deal with, i would be ok because eventually i believe i would be able to find another girl. but over the summer, i started losing my hair, rapidly. im 22. i know this isnt stress related because 1. early onset baldness runs in my family, and 2. i started a drug to help my hair loss (which i had noticed last year before it started to get really bad) and stopped the drug because i felt like it was not working. well. my hair had become dependent on the drug, and began to really recede and thin out rapidly. so. im balding at 22. i am a tall, skinny, very pale, babyface guy who cant grow a beard and has a large skull with a narrow face. i cannot pull off the bald look. at all. i can look at pictures of myself from 4 months ago and see a very noticeable difference in how i look. i used to be a youthful looking attractive guy who got compliments from girls all the time. now i feel like an old man, in a matter of months. i have zero confidence left. absolutely none. i spend all day every day thinking about my hairline, taking and analyzing pictures of myself, going to the bathroom every 20 minutes just to see if my hair looks ok. i feel, in my heart, that my dating life is over. i feel like no girl will ever want me again. i was so confident in myself and my looks 4 months ago, and now, nothing.  this makes my regret for ending my relationship increase 1000x. i had someone that loved me for me, and was so animalistically attracted to me, and i was to her, and now its done forever. i will never have that again. and if i made a different decision a few months ago i couldve had it for the rest of my life, even if i was bald.people will tell me to lower my standards, but im attracted to what im attracted to. my standards used to be attainable. now i feel like theyre not. and my hair situation will never get better, only worse. im 22 and i feel like the prime of my life is over.all these things have led me to being depressed']\n",

(i’m biased - i like cooking.) they view the aesthetic as a way of finding catharsis - it helps (in my case) curb the feeling of loneliness when you see someone else who seems like they may understand where you’re at, or at the very least, it helps you connect with people who have similar tastes to yours.hell, it’s more of a pastel-aesthetic, but i just wore my teddy fresh sweatshirt to the optometrist today, and my doctor was *super* cool and mentioned she had the same sweatshirt - turns out her and her husband are huge h3 fans, and we might all be going to catch a drink soon!i find that the depression aesthetic helps me find expression and catharsis. but this is just my opinion. i haven’t done nearly enough reading on it, and i’m super curious on what you lot think. ——- what are your thoughts on the depression aesthetic?are people who take on the style watering down the public image of depression']\n",

(this was the summer after my 5th grade) when i got home that day i didnt want to shower because i thought a bug would fly into one of my orifices and lay eggs or something, which was somewhat justified as we had an earwig problem. i wouldnt brush my teeth because i was too worried about swallowing a bit of toothpaste and being poisoned. when i washed my hands, i kept my mouth closed out of fear that soap would splash in there, yet i still washed them excessively, and i mean like every five minutes excessively. even my moms boyfriend, who was ocd himself, was getting pissed at me. i would hoard spit in my cheek rather than swallow if i thought there was anything toxic in there. this went on for a good couple of years throughout middle school, where i was more concerned about imaginary things killing me than my grades, or at least thats how i like to justify it. by eighth and ninth grade i was a pariah, a class clown who tried too hard to make friends, and i dont remember having any.so maybe thats why i miss being in a toxic relationship. maybe if i build up someone in my mind like i did with her, i can feel happy about myself because im with her. but that wasnt the case, i constantly worried about where we stood even at the best of our relationship. she wanted to marry me, but circumstances kept us from seeing each other and i always worried what she was doing. was she seeing someone else? that kind of thing. and i was right. she got back with her ex and told me we needed a break, and that shed let me know her choice in a month. that broke me. i was so fucking miserable i broke it off with her totally, leaving casualties in the form of a big rant over the phone about the douche she was dating and all but telling her to go to hell. it was the first time i had stood up to someone like that, and it lasted. i was an easygoing guy (on the outside anyway) until my senior year, when this happened, and i spent the rest of high school in a state of...idk, not really apathy but sort of defensively. i ignored our mutual friends assuming they had all sided with her, but i did end up dating a girl we both knew. we got too serious while i was still resentful over my ex, and it was this attitude that drove her away too.months later when im reconnecting with an old friend, i learn that, in fact, a number of my friends had sided with me but i never bothered trying to approach them. fuck. i spent my last year of school miserable for no good reason, i didnt even go to my prom or walk at graduation because i thought people hated my guts. and i cant shake that feeling, i work in retail yet i get more and more dismissive and resentful as time passes. ive become cynical as fuck and its pushed away said old friend. i want to write fiction as a career and i draw occasionally, and im less and less motivated to do either of them because im always so angry and exhausted from work. im really insecure about my body on top of all that, i was pretty fat through middle school but i managed to burn it through high school and now im a twig. im not even tall enough to be skinny, i found out recently im 511 after years of assuming im at least 6 feet because of the shorter women i dated. and the dude my ex left me for is at least 62. i dont buy into redpill shit or anything but it was pretty crushing. ive kind of grown to...not idolize, but look to slasher films as inspiration to stay strong back when i was alone in school, like friday the 13th, so i could feel tough and project some kind of confidence. i fucking hate myself for having to look at fictional serial killers for self esteem. not to mention theyre mostly, if not all at least six feet tall.i dont even remember what the point of posting this was, im more depressed']\n",

(topic of argument: whether or not it was begging rather than asking a favour when looking for a job) i cant exactly remember when something sparked in his mind, but he just flipped at me.ive lived a relatively comfortable, sheltered life, but there has been more and more pressure to spend less time playing around and more time working with my university studies, and work to find a part time job. for the past few months i have been tossing around a few applications (all rejection / no response) and until yesterday i hadnt dedicated much time to these (i do write my resumes to high standard, dont get me wrong).basically, when my dad flipped, he smacked his hands down on my desk (rattling some parts of my pc out of place so hard for perspective) and yelled about me about how sheltered i am and how much of a spoiled brat i was. to summarise what he told me there were two things that he said, one - \"you are so close to getting punched in the face right now, and its not child abuse any more its straight up assault\", and two - \"if you want to be treated like an adult then leave home, theres the world (points out window).\"note: my dad hasnt hit me in a while, but its happened before, and hes a controlling person with a short temper and little empathy. (did hit me once when he started shouting at me) he is known to lash out from time to time, unfortunately.the world i am being forced to live in now seems like it wont end, not the good ending where you retire, but just no light at the end of the tunnel. find a part time job, work hard at uni studies, get a better job, finish degree, get a better job from 9-5, pay off debts. which reminds me, im now being forced to pay part of my pay(possibly all) - should i get a part time job in the near-distant-future as rent. i dont know if its just my sheltered self talking here but it seems a bit much to have an 18 year old already paying rent for living at home, expect them to treat university as a full time job, get a part time job, take on lots of household chores, etc. etc.im 18, ive not been properly employed per se, but have had work experience for the best part of 6 years in the same role (paid). i havent seen a therapist nor have i confided in anyone or directly implied it, nor would i ever consider confiding, but i have more than a hunch i can relate to a lot of people in this subreddit...depression']\n",

      "['i graduated high school i went to work for my uncle at a cnc machine shop. i had a girlfriend, full time job with full benefits, a roth ira and a car. my girlfriend broke up with me and it shattered my world. the break up was terrible and she hurt me physically and emotionally. right after she broke up with me my uncle handed me a bag full of kratom extract at work because i was crying... he said, \"take this, itll make you feel better\" i did... i had always looked up to him and he was my boss- everyone was upset with my work at the time i was dealing with the break up... and it was kratom, i didnt think anything of it. pretty soon he started having me leave randomly in the middle of the work day to spend $500+ on opms gold kratom extract liquid shots, sometimes three times a day; id buy 20+ at a time. after awhile i recconnected with my friends and they were using drugs; xanax and oxycontin. i told my uncle about it and he wanted to buy oxycontin for him, he said if i did id be rewarded with money and more hours at work. during this time i was also financially supporting my father, i paid for everything except his car payment, insurance and phone bill -i bought the groceries paid gas electric and water... rent too. my uncle knew that i was in this situation and used it against me, my dad is his younger brother. so i did. going out and spending thousands on oxycontin, id go back to work expecting more work and hours and hed only hand me $20, sometimes hed give me $100 but no extra hours... hed get high and just laze around. eventually he pushed me into using oxycontin as well, saying he thought i was out to get him and that hed \"get rid of me\" if he felt too threatened so i did so he wouldnt see me as a threat. he said itd make me feel better, my ex girlfriend was stalking me and messing with my car, harrassing me everywhere i went. i became very dependent on it. after a couple months i couldnt go without kratom extract or oxy, my adderall prescription didnt even work on me anymore and my boss made me give him my prescription so he could trade it with other employees within the workplace for xanax and oxycontin. there were three occasions i almost lost my life because of this; the one that sticks out most in my mind is when i met a dealer in a walgreens parking lot and he handed me an empty taco bell bag- digging a knife hard into my side, i told him to take the $500 and just leave. when i left to tell my uncle what happened in tears he stared at me and said i was making it up to steal with him, that he couldnt stand the sight of me and that if i didnt have the money i stole from him by the next day at work he was going to fire me; and reminded me of how i was taking care of my father. he cut me off and i grew very sick, i couldnt sleep, sweating shaking and never eating. he drove me to a money tree and had me take out a payday loan to pay him back; then he blackmailed me into getting him pills again.being 19 i didnt know what else to do, my parents talked me out of college and i couldnt just leave my dad and work at a mcdonalds... we wouldve been homeless im sure... a dry spot over our town came around and the only dealer in town had fake presses with fentanyl in it -i warned uncle about how dangerous it was and he said he didnt care- forced the money into my hand and told me not to come back if i lost it, stole it or was going to be empty handed- to not even bother showing up to work if i didnt have anything for him. so i got it. we did that for three weeks straight, i was so sick i didnt care and he gave me back my regular hours -he had scaled my work week down to 20 hours a week. one day in his garage we were working and he clutches his chest and i say, \"whats wrong?\" and he goes, \"weve been doing heroin the past few weeks, ive done this before, ive felt this before. go and get narcan now\". i went and got narcan but he didnt need it at the end of the day... i was robbed dozens of times with the money he gave me and he held my job over my head and forced me to pay him back either going to money tree, or overdrafting bank accounts, cash advances from my credit cards, taking out loans... i was always just doing what i was told, i needed the job...i left after i was able to quit, i got very very sick for two weeks straight and was bedridden... i took out my final loan and relocated one hundred miles away to go to school. everything was going well until my roommate became addicted to methamphetamine and pawned off everything i owned... i was in need of work again so i started working with him again and soon after (i shouldve known...) he had me doing the same things all over again. i finally told my dad after two years of hiding it from everyone and he only talked to him... my uncle let him keep this car my dad was holding for him and he sold it for $3,000 and didnt think to give me a dime... didnt even think about all of the debt he had forced upon me... my dad told me to just \"forget about it, be a man. move on\". my uncle and i no longer talk anymore. my dad hasnt done anything except tell me im weak for letting it bother me. i tried to join the military but they sent me back home because of anxiety and depression (probably caused by this, i didnt tell them).but its so hard to move on... since ive been back ive had panic attacks regularly. i cant stop drinking myself to death and my depression']\n",

      "['i attend stuyvesant high school in nyc. its the top high school there, however its also known for causing depression and suicide, which even though i never thought i would be a part of i am now.&#x200b;im super depressed. no matter how hard i work, there are always people who do better than me. i am always up till midnight working, then get up at 6, go to school without coffee, pay attention in all my classes, then go back home and do homework. yet, despite all this, im doing worse than my peers. and im not doing worse than all of them; just my classmates specifically. im in ap bio and honors geometry and everyone there beats me. i just dont get it. i am naturally gifted with a great memory that is especially great at regurgitating information, which is amazing for tests; yet my bio average is a 92, which is below the class average of 93.6. i was so proud of my 92 until i learned what the class average was. now i constantly think, \"what did i do that lost me 1.6 points?\" i used to never worry about things like that. i used to not care what others scored; just myself, because if i was proud of myself that should be enough for me. but now, i feel the need to compare myself to everyone else. everything i do now is looked at by colleges, by my future teachers, and by my peers. whenever i used to do poorly on a test, i said it loud and proud, because that was my grade and i didnt care what everyone else thought of it. now, its humiliating. i constantly find myself lying about test grades to my classmates because im embarrassed to talk about them when i shouldnt be.&#x200b;furthermore, i just failed two tests this week. two. the first one (an ap bio test) i get; i had a very very busy monday night and only got three and a half hours of sleep. even though its still disappointing ive made amends with it. however, i just dont get the second one. i took a math test today. i got 10 hours of sleep last night. i studied an hour and a half yesterday and today. i reviewed with my classmates. i ate healthy food with proteins, even though i dont usually eat healthy just because of an exam. i did everything i was supposed to do and could do; yet on the test i couldnt solve 3 of the 8 questions. i almost vomited during the test from the stress of the idea of failing the test. and honestly i wish i had, because that would have meant i could have rewritten a page or two, which would give me more time to solve it. on one of the three, i made a simple error: rather than dividing by 10. i divided by 100. on the second i genuinely could not solve it because the diagram we were given was two parallelograms layered on top of a rectangle, which made it too complicated for me to understand (too many lines and angles to know which is the correct way to solve it). then the third one i ran out of time. if i had another minutes and a half i could have finished it. instead, im now receiving half credit at best. im fine with missing the first and second one, but its just sickening to think that i didnt get the first and third, when literally every other classmate did. i asked half a dozen, and they all had the same solutions, and had no difficulty at all solving them. and its not that im dumber than them or dont deserve to be in the same class; in fact i scored higher on the placement exam. i honestly dont know why im doing worse than them, and thats whats so depressing']\n",

      "['my first ever job interview today at the age of 24. it didnt go so great and ive been feeling extra depressed and worthless because of it.at the age of 24, ive just had my first ever job interview. i have a masters degree now, and ive left university, so ive run out of excuses to  not apply for jobs. i rarely ever apply for jobs because i feel like im worthless and ill never be good at anything. i have absolutely no value to anyone, and ive been living off my parents and off student loans for the past few years. i have a bad case of social anxiety and i often dont leave the house at all for weeks at a time, unless i absolutely need to. in the past few years, id mostly only ever leave the house to attend classes and exams at my university because i often dont even want to be *seen* by anyone, not even neighbours. now that uni is off the table, ive been almost entirely housebound since december 2014. i can hardly talk to/deal with people, and the thought of facing a job interview has always terrified me, more so the longer ive gone on without having ever been interviewed, and without any real work experience besides university projects.a week ago, i submitted my first batch of job interviews since completing my masters degree and for the first time ever, i actually got a call. i guess the masters qualification really is worth something. i was in a state of panic when i suddenly found myself in the middle of a phone interview, and after answering all the questions i was asked to the best of my ability, i was invited to come to an actual interview, which was today.i went and had the interview. im sorry to say it didnt go so great. i was quite nervous, and they didnt ask any of the \"common interview questions\" people are always advised to prepare for, so a lot of questions caught me off guard and i started struggling with feelings of anxiety the longer the interview went on. even though the interviewers were friendly and personable, i felt like running from the room and hiding myself away somewhere. im pretty sure i came across as a socially awkward, dysfunctional idiot, and ive been lying in bed since coming home from the interview hours ago, not moving, not doing anything. i almost feel traumatised, as pathetic as that sounds. i cant bring myself to get up and try to function because i feel like my worthlessness has been confirmed by the job interview. ill always be a loser. ill never be good enough to work anywhere for anyone. ill never amount to anything. i felt like crying earlier, now i just feel numb. so yeah, thats been my experience with my first ever job interview. i know im worthless, so you dont have to rub it in. i just wanted to let someone know how im feeling.i take solace in knowing im probably going to commit suicide when i turn 30. ive come up with this plan as a pact with myself to just endure and try my best for just a little while longer, but my 30th birthday in may 2020 is my expiry date. the world will be better off without me. i wish i werent so fucking pathetic. i wish i wasnt broken.**tl;dr** (in case you missed it at the top and scrolled to the end) had my first ever job interview today at the age of 24. it didnt go so great and ive been feeling extra depressed']\n",

      "['my family instead of the nearby middle school where most of my classmates were going. lost all my friends from elementary since i didnt go to the same school as them. i was a naturally shy kid to the point of extreme awkwardness when i was forced to change schools, and coming into a class where everyone already had established friend groups scared me to death which made me that weird kid who hid from everyone else during recess and i was that kid until i graduated from high school. i made a few \"friends\" over the years, but it never stuck because of my complete lack of social confidence. i was in this private school from 6th grade to senior year. i still wonder what my life would be like if i went to that public school instead.i started burning out when i hit high school. my entire high school life i procrastinated daily, choosing to grind out an essay at the last minute (usually during lunch). i chose to procrastinate because that meant i could chill in the library by myself instead of being forced to sit among my classmates who thought i was weird because i never talked to them. my perceived notions were most likely wrong, and if i had the social confidence to reach out, i probably would have made some friends. most of them were good people, but i was socially stupid. didnt study either and i somehow passed. \"smart but lazy.\"**college:** age 18. went to university because it seemed like the thing to do. procrastination/burnout problems followed me from high school and i stopped caring which meant i stopped going to class. i instead went to the library and watched youtube, listened to music and wrote a fanfic. terrible life decision? absolutely. did i know it was wrong? yes. but once it started, i couldnt stop it since i didnt know how to and didnt have the working habits to do so. **community college**: age 19-20. having not learned anything from past mistakes, i enrolled in community college having been placed on academic probation at the university. same story. even tried online classes, but i had no work structure which meant i had nothing to fallback on.**family**: father and his side of the family has been a no show since i was 8 years old. mom is a saint. have a brother and sister. we live with my grandma who while means well is a total pushover who is taken advantage of easily. when i was 12, her brother moved in and he lives on our couch at night while doing fuck-all in the daytime. nothing has changed. (for reference, i am now 22 years old.). this means there is always an uncomfortable aura in the house which means i can never fully unwind. i share a room with my brother and mother. the room was never meant to house more than one person and an extension, aka \"work room\" was built on to the bedroom which is what my brother and i share. i also have a grandfather who lives in vegas and hes been wanting me to live up there with him but i need to make money first, and i cant hold a job.**hobbies**: growing up, video games, listening to music, and reading books were my favorite things to do. overtime, ive lost interest in books though and i waste a lot of time on reddit these days. i also golfed from a very young age to about 17. i never liked it, i just did it because i thought my mom wanted me to do it. ive also had many random passing thoughts go by but never act on them. for example: archery, playing guitar/drums, making youtube videos, writing things, running and hiking are a few. ***jobs:*****counter/cook** - first job. held for 2 years. age 18-20. i was generally a good worker and dependable but occasionally i would show up a few minutes late. i had a good thing going at this particular restaurant and management liked me, but i quit. this was around the time i failed college. i even was rehired for a few weeks by the same manager before i impulsively quit again.**busser**-didnt get past the online orientation because i thought it was needlessly complicated, so i walked out.**cashier** (gas station)- made it past orientation but didnt show up for shifts.**cashier** (grocery store)-i made it one day, then stopped showing up.**movie theater**-got hired and didnt show up because my body wouldnt move out of the car. **movie theater (different location, current. age 22.) - finished my first shift yesterday and my brain really wants me to fall back to familiar habits and go no show again.***medical*****therapist** - started seeing one around age 19. i thought she wasnt helping me by just talking general stuff. so i cut off contact.**psychiatrist** - started seeing one age 21. depression']\n",

      "['my story is a little long. i’m the stereotypical gifted kid burnout. i zoomed through k-12 slacking but made it to pretty good college. i even got a decent scholarship plus an out of school scholarship. however that’s when everything fell apart. i finished my first semester with a 1.0 gpa. i got a d in english and failed calc iii. ironically enough, i never got less than a b on the essays i turned in. i didn’t have trouble with content per se and did well on most tests but i couldn’t find the motivation to go to class, do assignments, or study. i even accidentally missed a calc test. i am lazy piece of shit and i’ve always knew that but this is the first time i was actually punished for it. my in school scholarship is accessed at the end of spring so i still had time to improve. i was put on academic probation but i didn’t tell my parents. they had my two younger siblings to worry about so they didn’t really stress me out to much. they trusted me to be an adult so they didn’t feel the need to inspect my grades even though they were helping me out with money. being as i was always the star child, i was ashamed and told them that i was doing mediocre as opposed to abysmal. towards the end of my last semester, my friend helped me realize that was depressed. when the spring semester started, i started doing counseling. i of course didn’t tell my parents. i don’t know if it was shame or me not wanting them to worry. over the course of counseling, i found out that i have adhd but i wasn’t officially diagnosed til april. the second semester, like the first one, started off strong. i went to every class and did every assignment and even tried to start early. i had to retake english because i need a c to take the next level. the only available section was an 8 am. that’s where the wheel fell off. i had trouble picking a topic for a paper so i stopped going to class for a little bit. the anxiety from that spilled into my other classes. concurrently, i stopped do my calc iii hw since i was doing well in tests and quizzes. i eventually made it back to my english class but my professor gave me stiff stipulation for a c (which was fair considering she could have just failed me, which she ended up doing, but at least she gave me a chance first). she helped me finish the essay i was stressed about but by then i was very behind. i was very depressed. i found myself smoking weed on weekdays and sleeping all day. the only spotlight was my poli sci class where i got an a. all in all, i brought my gpa to 1.95 but it wasn’t enough. i was suspended and lost my scholarships but didn’t tell my parents. over the summer, i appealed my suspension and scholarship and got both back. this semester was supposed to be my moment of redemption. however, i failed and it was no fault but my own. and it was the same story. start of strong but crap out in the end. throughout the semester i’ve told my parents that i’m doing better but that’s not true. i kept it from them because i thought i could fix it but now, everything is going to come out when howard doesn’t allow me back. tbh, part of it kind of freeing because now i don’t have to live a lie but it’s hard to tell my parents who are immigrants that i wasted their time and money because of foolishness. i wish i partied my grades away but i spent most of my time moping and depressed']\n",

      "['my senior year of high school, and i’ve been depressed since about halfway through last year. my schedule consisted entirely of ap classes last year and that’s what it mostly is this year too. i became close friends with a buddy of mine and his girlfriend last year and we had great times hanging out, but due to misunderstandings and conflicts that have happened recently, i’m currently not on speaking terms with either of them. his girlfriend and i probably won’t ever speak to each other again due to what happened. and i’m not speaking with her boyfriend because i’ve been upset about not being friends with her, and it caused me to briefly have romantic feelings for her. i probably shouldn’t have done this but it’s too late now, but i told him how i felt and he got mad and told me to not talk to him or his girlfriend. right now the only thing it seems i can do is let him be mad and let enough time pass that he gets over it. i should note that i don’t have feelings for her anymore, and i told him that, but hes still mad. i’m an introvert and i’m in the top 3 or 4% of my class so there’s not a whole lot of people that i really hang out with. i guess i’m most upset about not being friends with those two people and i just want to feel better in general. i’ve been looking into mindfulness, meditation, and i’ve been exercising more in order to try and cope with everything. i play hockey which is a good source of exercise and helps take my mind off of things. i’ve also been watching some of my favorite tv shows (the office, parks and rec, friends) in order to try and laugh a little bit. if i had to guess i would say my depression']\n",

is it your original world view constructed and reinforced through countless years of conditioning causing this? like my mother, i too identified as the victim until i found the state of consciousness aware of my thoughts, and by being aware of them i was able to dis-associate from them similar to awakening from a dream that had taken place over my entire life.i see a lot of posts desiring to be understood by other people, for a social connection to their deeper layer of unhappiness. to this i say sure, i understand this desire. but are you simultaneously capable of understanding others not in your realm of thinking?

      "['my life ive started hating myself more and more. it started out slow with just finding some of my insecurities annoying but its evolved into hating the entirety of the person ive become and im not sure i can do anything about it. im antisocial and socially awkward but ive managed to get myself into a few different friends groups, even though im fairly certain im at the bottom of all of them. i have contradicting feelings that make me question whether im depressed or just a pussy when it comes to life. im really insecure about myself and how i act and whether what indo is perceived as normal or weird. i also almost always second guess conversations and relive every mess up i have when i flounder in casual conversation, which happens a lot. i have some really good times with these friend groups but the moment theyre over i have my lowest lows where i just lay on my bed listening to music that just makes me feel worse for hours. it feels as if im simply a spectator to life, where even though i have friend groups im often not invited or told about some events, or im talked over, or it just feels as if its unnecessary for me to be there. i think about death and wanting to die on a daily basis, yet actively committing suicide or doing anything that would purposefully put me in danger is too active. instead i constantly think \"hey itd be awesome if i could be diagnosed with some rapid fatal disease\" or \"god i really hope a truck comes out of nowhere and t-bones me when i go through this intersection\". im at a point where i dont think ill ever commit suicide, but i also dont fear death and find myself longing for it. i think there are people who care about me, mostly family and relatives but i can tell that im often a burden to them or frustrate them because im total assholes to them. i no longer am expressive towards people and often do the bare minimum to the point where i rarely even say \"i love you\" to my family members and only do it when i think im supposed to and not because i want to say it. i was doing research and im not too sure if i have schizoid because ive become pretty emotionally distant; most of the time i interact with people or friends it feels like im either faking it or altering my personality to mimick theirs because i just dont feel things the same way anymore. i think a large part of the way im feeling is because i dont have anyone in my life that cares for me or i care for. im almost 19 years old and talking to people i dont know stresses me out, ive never had a girlfriend or any super close friends, ive kept most of my personality, feelings and thoughts buried deep inside me for years. the other night when i was hanging out with my closest friend group we were all drinking and having a really good time for the first few ours. i probably drank too much and i got really depressed, and while i know alcohol can do that to you i dont think that was it; instead it simply felt like the years of covering up and burying my feelings was undone and i got a glimpse of my extremely depressed inner self, to the point where for the remainder of the night i was just sitting kneeled up in corners hating and isolating myself. my friends saw this and tried go bring me back in the conversations but i ended up just pushing them away. my one friend even came up to me and was like \"hey lets talk, anything you want to say say it and lets talk about it\" to which i basically said \"i really wish i could but i physically cant. i really appreciate you coming to try and talk, but you should just go back and enjoy yourself, im fine\". this was just the other night and i regret it so much because we all wont see each other for a few more months with winter break coming to an end and i spent the majority of our last night in a corner depressed by myself pushing them away. that night i saw how raw and depressed i am on the inside and it honestly has scared the shit out of because i didnt think i was anywhere near that low.all in all ive just become a total asshole over the years, to friends, family, people in general and i hate who ive become. and as i said before, i dont see me killing myself but i also dont see a future past college. i have no dreams or aspirations because i know ill never get there, and it feels like im only living and doing things because im supposed to and its what people expect of me. i just wish i could pop out of existence. i realize i should probably get a therapist or find someone to talk to but ive got my feelings so locked up i just cant bring myself to do it. i also fear that if i go to a therapist or doctor theyll just tell me theres nothing wrong with me and thats its all in my head or that what im experiencing isnt what i think. i feel so empty, stressed, depressed']\n",

      "['my mum called me sensitive yesterday in a dejected tone. the book teaches you that when you have a thought, in a nutshell, it is not you, and rather it is a voice that you can choose to believe or not to believe.it is a hard skill that needs practice, but with other tools the book gives you, i have noticed it started to get easier everytime with practice.so i got to examining, much like a lawyer in a case of widespread pain and trauma, the thought of why i might be so sensitive.i realised depressed people are sensitive because their mental networks and impressions of the world often lead to wrong conclusions. hence, the smallest thing that would upset them, wouldnt upset another person, because a depressed persons train of thought often leads to something very painful, whereas a non-depressed person would have different interpretations of the event.  the key words here are interpretations and perspective.(i am now realising nobody is probably going to read this.)&#x200b;for example, my ex and my friends were at a dinner, where she and i both decided to not make eye contact and / or any contact at all. this is the setting.now in my personal depressed mindset, i usually would take it as \"omg she hates me... and now because she pretends i dont exist, i cant be in a conversation she is in, and if that conversation involves the whole group, then i cant be a part of the group!\"usually followed by a strong mental breakdown, and being judged as sensitive just because a person decided not to talk to me.however in a depressed mindset, the strong negative emotions you are feeling seem to be so genuinely real, that when someone calls you sensitive, you get very annoyed, angry, and feel so very misunderstood.&#x200b;now i have accidentally started to turn a new leaf.with new skills i have learnt, the breakdown train stops at, or at least pauses at \"omg she hates me blah blah blah\" leading to the possibility of reach a different conclusion with less negative thoughts.by pausing and considering that some thoughts the brain has may be lies that are tricking itself, i started to analyse rather than ruminate and get stuck in the self sustaining cycle powered by negative emotion.\\x14heres how my new interpretation went.\"shes not talking to me. i should leave. i shouldnt be here. this is uncomfortable.\"\"pause. wait a minute. what if my mind is lying to itself, and seeing things that are not there.\"\"shes not talking to me. its time to be upset.\"\"ok be upset in just a second, maybe youre radar of what is going on is very off. use the new skill of mindfulness. sit with the pain for a second. the skills say that by sitting with a problem, the best answer usually comes to the mind when you stop looking for one. it is a weird feature of the brain.\"\"look a little closely. you know she is a nice person, so what she is doing must be justified in her logic.\"\"maybe shes not talking to you for another reason rather than to put you at an outcast. ooh wait! maybe shes trying to avoid conflict. that is totally fair. we are at another friends birthday. this would not be the time or place to try rebuild.\"\"you apologised with a letter, so you dont have to feel guilty either. you have also done the right thing, so while circumstances are shit, yes, the need for self criticism is instead a habit in this case rather than a genuine requirement of the situation. and if you do end up criticising yourself, you should at least do so like a cinema goer watching the event unfold from a cinema seat rather that having a starring role in the movie itself, where you as the character feels the pain directly.\"&#x200b;suddenly the conclusion reached is totally different and a lot less negative.tldr: interpretations of an event, coupled with a long term practice of mindfulness (which i deeply suggest everyone should do) is a very strong tool, and the right way to come out of depression']\n",

i found a girl at my work that was worthwhile, someone i could literally see myself with. have you heard the saying, if your patient the right girl will come to you...well, she was the one for me, the girl ive waited and looked for so long. she literally had every quality i wanted from a girl, sincerely nice, outgoing and fun. i changed so much for her. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people and i went back to finish college and even got my first real career job as a software developer just to prove to her im not a loser. in someways, it helped made me become the cool, confident person i always wanted to be and envisioned myself to be when i became 21. basically, i felt like i was at my prime and i thought that everything was going into place, this was the fantasy moment i always envisioned.she took notice of my change from that quiet shy guy to the new person i am now, and me and her got close for the past few months. we never kissed or held hands but i definitely felt some small spark and unlike other guys shes been with, she didnt mind the occasional kiss on the cheeks here and there. she is touched with the things i do for her and we would spend hours together after work. i would help her with work off the clock, comfort her when she was down and do just anything to make her happy.... she would drag me everywhere and she says my name in a certain way that just makes my heart melt. she was the first girl i ever felt being fully comfortable being just myself around. i thought this was a sign.... i just needed that one break, that one chance to prove to her that i am an awesome person that wont hurt her like her ex did to her.....i never got a real chance, i was shot down even before i could ask her out on a date...a real date with just me and her and not a group thing with her friends....she told me she did have some feelings for me, but she said shes afraid it would never workout. she said she doesnt want to lose me if it never works out....she was sincere about that but i knew the other big real reason. she is still hung up on her ex. she always told me she was over him but when a girl says shes 99% over with her ex, you know she is totally not. the ex works right next door and would always come over to her and try to patch things up with her. she never gave me a real chance because she still loves him....and im left in the dust, heartbroken, a \"friend\" in her eyes and at best a plan \"b\".....i dont talk to her as much anymore as i just wanted my feelings to die at this point....talking to her would just bring those feelings back...and i dont want to go back....the pain was already too much the first time...i became so fucking depressed. this wasnt the first time this happened to me, ive had girls do this to me before, but i didnt take it too seriously cause i wasnt really very close to those girls. but i felt so sure about this one....it was the closest ive ever been to a girl and the closest ive ever been to getting a girlfriend and for the first time ever, i truly felt the \"spark\" i always hear about from relationships. it hurts even more that despite my brain saying to just move on, my fucking heart keeps on trying to find any excuse to try again. i feel awkward now because sometimes the new coworkers comment on how i am. some are flattering, like they say how im pretty cute but others say i look like a fuckboy or a chad. its just a reminder of how much i changed. they judge my appearance and demeanor and thought i be the type to have a girlfriend but really i am a socially awkward loveless loser...and them saying that only makes me feel so fucking fake...of how much i changed for someone that never truly had the same feelings back...one things for sure, i dont think i can open up to another girl anymore....atleast for a while....now its just wallowing in my sorrow of being so alone in this fucking world....i just want one fucking chance....why is it so fucking hard to give a guy a chance....&#x200b;tl:dr;  i never had a girlfriend. every rejection pushed me to better myself in someway. recently met the girl of my dream. i got back into shape, i started dressing really nice, i became so much more confident, funny and witty around people. she was interested in me and i was in love with her, but she wouldnt let go of her ex. then she rejected me and said she liked me as a \"friend\".....biggest heartbreak ever. now, im depressed']\n",

      "['myself who the hell has time to write in a diary.when depression hit, i realized i had time, and i needed a method to release my emotions and feelings. i turned to writing in a journal. i put my heart into journalling everyday for about six months releasing my emotions and negative thoughts into it. it helped my depression tremendously. as i started to recover, i built momentum from writing so much that i told myself that i should start a blog to help others and myself who are/were depressed. by starting a blog, i had something to do during my depression which now turned into a passion. i became more confident as what i write is honest and i am not putting a fake self *cough cough* like all the people on instagram and facebook. it helped me in discovering who i was as a person and what i wanted in my life. it made me feel more real and allowed me to show vulnerability which was never possible previously.check out my blog here: [www.millennialspath.com](http://www.millennialspath.com)\\u200bthe best blog that i wrote about depression is using my teenage hobbies for self cognition-behavioural therapy to treat depression']\n",

      "['my parents early divorce, probable attachment disorder and intermittent emotional neglect and psychological abuse.  i was diagnosed at 16 and had some good luck with anti-depression meds at first.  my mainstay coping mechanisms, though, developed in early college:  alcohol and weed.  i did take meds intermittently, but never felt great about big pharmas game and the results were so mixed that although i was often using anti-depressants and stimulants, i mostly tried to self medicate, plus drinking and getting high were socially acceptable and encouraged in my friend groups.  i also fell in love in early adulthood, and 18 years later i’m divorced with a (now 10 year old) son.  and although we had a good 12 years, the final years of marriage were awful.  the sobriety of parenting together undid us, and i firmly believe it was in no small part because we no longer were able to numb out on booze together.  plus i was not able to get it up (thanks years of weed and meds!) which of course did not help the reduction of intimacy that often follows a first child.  years of resentment boiled up as we proved to be more and more out of love as our beautiful baby became a boy.  my ex dealt with our dysfunction by sleeping with my trusted “friend”. the ugly end of literally the only beneficial family relationship i had left, that seemed unshakable only years before, also happened at about the same time as my career collapse, something that also seemed unlikely.  in that same year my marriage shattered, i had to walk out of the elementary classroom i taught to be tried before hr for the decline of my abilities, only to lose my composure so entirely that i had to go home mid-day without even saying good-bye to the students.  i went on long term disability the next day for my mental state and never returned to that school or classroom teaching.   my son’s age at the unraveling of our relationship, being almost identical to my own when my folks split, caused any healing i had done from that trauma to explode and fester.  i was going through all this as we marched through the stages of pre-trial divorce.  at the time i was given more and more meds to help me through, and i kicked regular substance use entirely, dropping decades worth of friendships (built on substances) from my life.  now it is almost 6 years later and i have had some successes (reduced my meds, still living without substances, steady employment) but have very little to show for a life at my age.  yes i am a consistent and loving dad (i know that is not a small thing, and i’m proud of that) with 50% custody but my income is just barely enough to allow me to live in the gentrified neighborhood my son knows and loves, that is near his mom, his school and his friends.  i have a career i can handle without having to be on tons of meds (nannying for a wealthy family) but i do not have any growth opportunities there, no prestige, no long term plan, no benefits, no retirement.  i am living paycheck to paycheck.  and even though i did have a positive relationship after the divorce for a couple of years, i am alone now and after a year of online dating and some near misses, i feel like from the outside i am a man without a future, without money, without an extended family and without ambition (beyond not being depressed).  although i look pretty good, i have persistent foot pain and low energy. i feel like i stink of mid-life collapse and i am losing faith that i will ever be able to attract anyone who can help me be the person i am capable of being, someone that i can love and be loved by.so back to my question:  since my sobriety and recent reduction of medications (this past year), i have become much less numb to my pain and tragic history. i am feeling all the feelings. as i have made my life smaller and more manageable i have tried to confront the feelings that drive so much of my inner conflict.  i have delved into many books, self-guided classes and attempts at living a more healthy life.  i have gone deeper into psychotherapy than i ever could have on all those meds, but i am so deflated and tired  from the depth of the lows, that i wonder if really feeling my feelings is going to help me anymore.  i have been able to find a few core things that i can tell really do help me (yoga, exercise, journaling, low-inflammation dieting, meditation) but i cannot seem to make any of them actual habits.  it’s hard to take on new habits alone, with almost no community and little discretionary income to invest in myself.from reading and listening to lots of books (on attachment, psychology, self-help, mindfulness, etc) i have been left with the overriding feeling that addressing my problems starts with developing good habits.  that if i only improve my character by developing better mental toughness then i will no longer live my traumas over and over again, and i’ll be able to use self-discipline to move on and contextualize my past so i can thrive in the present and future.  my therapist sees encouraging signs in our sessions, but my psychiatrist is very concerned at my plunging scores on depression']\n",

      "['myself to be happy, i was getting good grades, and on the surface i seemed like i was successful. i didn’t get into the university of my choice, but i was offered an opportunity to reapply if my gpa was high enough. at my graduation there was this girl i had started talking to from one of my classes. she was a 10/10, but a lot of people i knew didn’t like her because of what one of her ex’s says about her (that she’s crazy and a whore). i offered her some help early that year dealing with some of his crap and we became friends over it. everyone was hugging so i felt no shame in hugging her too. about a month later i broke up with my girlfriend. it took me 3 years to realize the whole time i was being emotionally abused and drained to the point my family noticed a complete change in my happiness. i went to drink the pain away, and instead of drinking alone like an idiot, i wanted to drink with someone that understood the pain i was going through. i texted her and she said yes, but she would have to sneak out. enter one of the best nights of my life and the start to the most memorable summer ever. we started dating two or three weeks later, after i was one of the few people to ask what happened to her when her phone went dark (she had gotten in serious trouble from her parents, no cell), and immediately fell in love with her family and her. she broke me out of a shell i had no idea i was in. we were sporadic, doing things on a whim. i had always wanted to live my life on a “why not” basis, and that was the only way we did anything. we would only plan for bigger things, occasionally throwing them out for better ones. in the summer she allowed me to experience what it meant to have fun, and to enjoy life. fall hit her hard though. she has so many problems from her dad leaving her family, one of which is seasonal depression. when i went off to college, we tried to make it work. she started to exist on seeing me on that once a week schedule, me being the only one to make her feel happier and fulfilled. meanwhile i had so much trouble adjusting and taking the pressure. i cut for the first time just before i left, and cut again later in the semester. i was disgusted with myself, but for some reason i still did it again. one night i nearly put a knife through my forearm, and another with my girlfriend, had a panic attack while drunk. she forced me to seek a therapist, and without that i likely would have been making this post. i cried on the way back home with her, and she was right there for me, realizing how fucked up i was. to say that it was all perfect though would be an oversight. we did break up during the semester and she did see someone for a one time thing. i decided not to hold it against her because of what she meant to me, and because it was totally stupid on her part. we would bicker at times too, often times because i would say something stupid because of a lack of social skills and her belief that she was fragile. yet it still worked until about middle of the semester where she greened out at a party and woke up to a guy who made a move on her. that was some final straw for her, and i think it broke her on some level and we broke up for the second time. assuming she needed time to figure things out, i started talking to close friends about the incident to get their opinions. i spoke to one of them who i forgot was a mandatory reporter. for the sake of brevity, i had to make a police report, and the night i made it she got a phone call from the local police department and the next day three officers showed up in her school. she screamed at me, but i knew what was at stake and what i had just done. her family lived on a knifes edge, and she was trying to repair her relationship with her mom. her friends could have started asking questions, possibly leaving her. her freedom became questionable, as she was getting high again, which was the reason in the summer she had got in so much trouble. but nothing happened. and i had to fix this. i hadn’t played piano in 10 years, yet two days after she screamed at me, i began again. in 10 days, i learned the song that symbolized the entire thing to me. i originally gave myself a window of 14 days, but i was ready. i recorded it and sent it to her, with the best apology i could have come up with. “it’s beautiful, but it doesn’t change anything.”and i knew that. but again in vain i still tried, i promised myself i would be home for her birthday so i was. i had already started on her gift and gave it to her. i just wanted to have a true conversation with her about all of this. to get closure and to understand what the future would hold. i have her my gift and asked her to talk to me, so we did. we talked for two hours. it came down to us being fundamentally different people, but agreeing we were each other’s best. that we could not be friends because the feelings would be to great. that we should try to move on from each other, and maybe decades down the line reconnect. when we hugged as a final goodbye, my throat hitched. she pulled away and put her hand on my face. she realized what she did immediately, but that was the moment that i became me. that i started to close off again.it was like this until she wished me happy birthday. she was the only one to do so, because i tell no one about it. but even my best friends didn’t say a word, so it meant something to me. i’m hindsight it was rather innocuous, but i dwelled on it for a little while. then walking through the city with my family it happened for the first time. i was looking at christmas lights and i saw us. laughing, looking up at the lights, holding each other. i blinked and it was gone. those moments have been happening occasionally since, in places that meant something to me or to us. i will see us in the perfect instagram ready photo, and it will ruin me for the day. i’ve tried my best to move on, got a tinder, started talking to as many people as possible. nothing works, and i realized it’s because i’ve been given the gift of caring for others: not flirting. so i’m going to delete my tinder and make sure that i’m not so stupid moving forward. about a week ago, i noticed her instagram post were getting progressively more depressing. she blocked me and unblocked in a span of 12 hours. i decided to say something, not as someone wanting her back, but as someone who was genuinely concerned. she said she was fine, and we texted until i got a one word response. now to summarize: we have the girl who broke me out of my shell and helped me experience life. who probably stopped me from someday killing myself. who was the one who taught me what true love really meant. and that i ruined in one action, to destroy any future chance i had. what i want now is what i wanted two months ago. i want this fixed, and i want to be able to hold her again. i decided this january i would think about making another attempt to reconnect, but if it seems too much i won’t. i really think it’s done and over with. i don’t need to hear the crap about “there’s so many other fish in the sea.” i know there are. but how many fish do you believe you owe your life to? that you think about every night? that you sometimes cry yourself to sleep over?if i had the chance again, i would live my life to the fullest with her. i’d change my dreams based on this one delusion. and i’m not sure if the world would agree with me. i just needed to put this in writing. if you’re still with me, am i crazy? i already know i’m depressed']\n",

      "['my life, childhood, teenage years, into adulthood, ive fantasized about the life i wish i had, whatever the current version of that happened to be. i do this on an almost constant basis. i fantasize about being successful and well respected. i fantasize about not being trapped in my current life situation (whatever that happens to be). i fantasize about traveling the world. i spend inordinate amounts of time on google earth, traveling the world vicariously through a computer. ive \"street view driven\" up the coast of chile into peru, up the pch from la to sf, across canada (i skip a lot of sections when i think theyll be repetitive). reality: im pretty mediocre at everything. i never make enough money to travel as much as i want to or live more comfortably, or buy my fiancé an engagement ring (weve been engaged for two years), or buy a non-craigslist car (terrible terrible credit). i work a tech support job where i give just enough of a shit to not get fired, so i know ill never get promoted beyond that, because i just dont fucking care. i pursued music for years, only to make it to the most mediocre of career levels...did i just use the word \"career\"? lol. wow. i rarely ever made money, so, yeah, no. also, i was given every opportunity ever and squandered every bit of it. im trying to get better: eating better, maybe some exercise, meditation, on meds now (but are they helping?), trying to give a shit more. i never seem to have the will to keep going, so i plateau right at the most mediocre level. not terrible, but always just..not...good enough. ive lost interest in music, the one thing i love more than anything. i cant stand to be around my fiancé. and then two months later ill be really happy to see her (maybe im just self-absorbed). life is just one big long sarcastic joke, to me. anything i could get enjoyment out of is just bland, or i find a way to shit on it. my memory is getting really bad. i forget names left and right, facts i need to do my job, i constantly cant find the right words for things. i get really bad brain fog every day. it seems to happen after i eat, but not every time. if i eat the same thing every day for a week, ill still get it at random times. it seriously lowers my iq by probably like, 20 points, who knows. social skills go down, i talk slower, critical thinking skills go out the window, cant focus. its the most frustrating thing in my life.should see a doctor but dont know where to start because i dont even know where to find a damn primary care physician because there are hardly any in network. and then, yknow, analysis paralysis, which is the story of my life. the reason i never take the right risks. the reason i never move forward. the reason id rather do nothing than do the wrong thing. the reason i never do the right thing.that was long and rambling and didnt get to the point probably as much as id like it to. (mediocre post)so tonight i had a suicide fantasy. i was sitting at my kitchen/livingroom/holyshitmyapartmentissmall table with a bottle of bourbon and all of my wellbutrin, popping them every few minutes, with an x-acto knife next to me and a suicide note on paper and on the computer, ready to put on social media. then my fiancé comes in unexpectedly with a mutual friend. they find me in shambles and drive me to the hospital to get my stomach pumped. i had control over that, so i guess i wanted to be found? i did it the other way too, where i climbed up on the roof, laid back, my head at the lower end of the pitch, sliced up my arms and neck, and my neighbor finds me, or my fiancé finds me (it changed a few times). it was like a really fucking depressing']\n",

      "['my first post in the depression and im not sure why im posting. i guess i just need to get it off my chest. i think im depressed. i say i think cause ive never been diagnosed or sought treatment for depression in particular. im 22 now but ive been dealing with body image issues since i was 11 and the bulimia from sophomore year of high school. that was around the same time i started self harming. but no one could tell-i made sure to hurt myself in places covered by clothes and i still kept the same cheery demeanor i did everyday. i had good grades, a small but stable group of friends,  sports, played in the marching band. never went to a party. the ideal, boring high school student. my family had some issues, mainly between my brother and my dad, but i tried to stay out of it and be the dutiful daughter. doing chores, watching my siblings, listening to my parents. the self harming curbed as i was about to go to college but my eating disorder got worse. got to college and my first 2 years were pretty rough academically. skated by on natural talent in high school and realized that doesnt fly in university. ignored my grades and just tried to socialize as much as possible and started restricting my diet like crazy and working out for at least 2 hours a day just to feel in control. dropped to 105lb (im 54). was diagnosed with adhd my junior year much to the dismay of my parents-i was supposed to be the golden child. my brother was the trouble kid with the depression, anger issues, and adhd. just got medicated never went to therapy. junior year i was in a relationship. felt like i was soaring, continued to do mediocre in my classes and when i began to crash, i tried to turn to my then boyfriend for support but turns out he would rather go out to the bar and talk to other people. we broke up at the end of the year. depended on him so much i lost touch with a lot of friends and opportunities. during that time i didnt take my adhd meds regularly. just made me feel like shit that i had to take them in the first place. senior year my stress, depression, and anxiety was even worse. felt suicidal. was vomiting everyday and my grades were plummeting. felt like i was an idiot for picking a major as difficult as computer science when i wasnt applying myself like i should. tried a couple therapy sessions at the end of the year and tried to talk to my mom about sitting in on a session over the phone and she screamed at me about how i was faking/overreacting. dropped to 94lb around this time. i was also about to take my 5th year cause i had planned my classes so horribly and also wanted to improve my gpa. i think i wouldve really hurt myself seriously if my current boyfriend wasnt there to just keep me company and be positive. still, i never told him fully what was going on. now hes in california and im on the east coast and were doing a long distance thing and hes still amazing. so loving and kind and ive let him know to a small extent my feelings of depression and i made it seem like i used to have an eating disorder though i still have episodes to this day. but things at home are getting worse and my mom and dad are fighting, my brother (20, has pretty mentally abusive tendencies stemming from anger and depression) is making things harder on my mom and i can see her starting to crack. my little sister (11) cries in secret after their fights and im the one who tries to comfort her when shes trying to get away. im at home now for winter break and im so stressed about home life once i leave and my mom has no one to help her cook, clean, or listen to her. also been stressed this past month because last semester, right before finals i fainted twice in 3 days and got concussed. felt silly the first time i fainted (during an exam) and tried to brush it off and just made a couple appointments to check myself out the next week. fainted 2 days later, hit my head harder. concussed. still have headaches and my mood has been even lower but i still have to study. yet, im still trying to be supportive and happy for my mom. trying to help around the house while studying for the exams i couldnt take. trying to build a better relationship with my brother and help him even when he hurls abuse at me, not that thats always. trying and trying but not feeling like im making any progress. feel like im a failure. ive always \"joked\" for the last few years i wasnt gonna make it past 30 cause of stress and the fact i get sick all the time. been saying that a little more often and my boyfriends picking up on it and hes starting to get concerned but now im doing my best to cover it up. last night, he called me and i joked i wanted to die. but for a bit i didnt know if i was joking. i wasnt even sad anymore. just reached a point where i didnt feel anything and just thought of how i could kill myself-obviously didnt act on it. just told my boyfriend i didnt much want to talk about what was going on and went to sleep. i dont know if this is dissociation but i can imagine myself being gone without feeling much right now. and at the moment that doesnt even scare me. just wanted to get that off my chest. &#x200b;tldr; i look happy, successful, healthy, and smart but im dealing with an eating disorder, family issues, post concussion syndrome, academic struggles, and what i think is depression']\n",

      "['my grades were alright, i lived a healthy, alcohol and sugarfree life... had everything to be happy, until i decided to fuck up everything last summer. first thing i ruined was my relationship. i met someone who made me realize my boyfriend and i were probably not meant to be, who made me realize our lacking sex life was not due to it becoming a habit, but simply because i didnt feel attracted to him anymore. being only 20, i decided to end the relationship. it left us both in pain, but for different reasons. he was heartbroken because he felt like he had lost the love of his life, and i was sad for losing my best friend and companion, who i had planned to spend my three-month-long summer holiday with. of course, those plans were cancelled now and i basically spent three months alone. i could have spend them with family but.... my father is always gone for work (and only sleeps or complains when he is at home), my brother is either biking/partying... and then it comes down to my mom and i. our relationship had been extremely difficult when i was a teen. it was better now... but to spend three months with her was pretty...tiresome. she complains a lot. about my dad and brother, about how hard it is to combine work with a family....( sidenote : she works 4/5 - we have a cleaner and she rarely cooks, so i dont even know why she is complaining). so actually, i was really happy when summer was over and i could go back to uni.however, the second thing i ruined was giving up my healthy life style. being active in a students association and  partying sober, not much fun in that. i went from partying once or twice in the semester to at least two times a week, and i drank a lot. sometimes to silence my head, sometimes accidentally.i was a fool to think the alcohol wouldnt take revenge on my body. since the summer holidays, i have gained around 20 pounds ( i blame alcohol and preferring take-away food) and seeing the weight on the scale makes me hate myself and the way i am behaving. i am neglecting myself, but i cant find the strength or energy to change it.i noticed that it seems to get worse when im home. at uni, i have the possibility to go out eat somewhat healthy at the students restaurant, but at home...i live in a rural area where there is litterally nothing to be seen, and as i said before, my mom hates cooking, our schemes do not co-operate, so i mostly eat alone anyway...going home makes me feel incredibly empty. it has come to the point where i dont leave my room anymore as to avoid all social contact with my (estranged) family members, except to eat.tl;dr : thought depressive']\n",

(some background, me - 14, sister - 17, friend - 15) i felt so scared that she wasnt responding even though she was just asleep. i was breathing hard and shaking at work when i had nothing to do. i felt so pressured as well.* the company i work at (small little sandwich shop) has a jacket that i can wear if i get cold. i only wear it to cover up my arm because i dont want people to see my cuts. i had to wash the dishes and my boss said that i have to take off the jacket. i told her that my cat scratched me. she told me to show her and i did (it was one cut on the top of my arm, all the other cuts are on the other side of my arm). she asked me if i was okay and how im doing. i felt embarrassed but also comforted because she cares about me a lot. * i forgot to take my anxiety medicine today so it just hasnt been the best. i wish that i did this morning because today probably would have gone better. that is it from today at work, nothing else happened. if you did decide to go and read the other post i did, i did mention that i wanted to cut myself. and yes, i did mention that i do in this post. i found some sharp blades from a little handheld knife. the first time i cut i did not go very deep, just a few little scratches. i was clean for 2 days before i did it last night because life just has really gone horribly for me the past months. life just is not that good for me right now. i also mentioned that i was going to get a therapist and that was supposed to happen about a week ago. my mom is in new orleans with her friends (again, if you read the other post, i said that she goes out with them a lot and it has made my life not great). last weekend, when i did start to cut, she was gone and i couldnt talk to her, i didnt have the friends i talk to now whenever i want to cut. they do support me when i want to cut and they always at least try to convince me to not cut. it only works sometimes. most of the time, it doesnt work and i still end up cutting.i ate dinner last night. i went out with my friends to target and got a stomach ache. that is the very reason why i dont eat dinner, i get stomach aches whenever i eat dinner. i hate it so much. we were having such a good time then i just randomly got a stomach ache and kinda ruined my night. but it did eventually go away and my friends did make me feel better. something completely different from what i was saying, but i realized that i hate myself. i hate that i need so much attention and reassurance. i hate that i need to take medicine for something that so many people in the world dont even have to worry about (ironic). i hate that i cut myself when there are obviously so many other better ways to deal with depression']\n",

      "['my position in life, but i’m just not happy.i’ll try keep it brief and not ramble. my best friend is relapsing with her anorexia and i’m pretty much her only support, she has no other close friends and her parents are nowhere as supportive as they should be. over the past few weeks she has collapsed once, self harmed multiple times and had to go to an emergency appointment because she’d made herself so unwell from not eating and taking laxatives. one of the times that she self harmed i was at work and had to call an ambulance for her. i spend most of my time with her and we’re supposed to be moving in together next week. i love her to pieces but i’m scared that moving out with her is going to be too much and i’m starting to struggle with the responsibility i feel for her.i’ve had my own issues around eating in the past, i’m a lot better than i was and i don’t feel as though my friend’s ed is triggering me but i do know i still have tendencies that aren’t “normal” eating, i won’t eat anything if i want to wear something cropped/tight cos i’m scared of how my stomach looks and i’d love to start going back to the gym but i know how obsessive i get and i don’t want to fall back into the routine i had for myself of logging everything i ate and counting every nutrient. i also struggle with my body image generally and this plays on my mind a lot. i hate most of my features and i’m contemplating getting rhinoplasty if i can afford it. i’ve recently split up with my boyfriend of nearly 2 years as we stopped getting along like we should and his reliance on weed was starting to cause issues for me again. in all honesty i’m mostly okay about the breakup because i knew it had to happen and i feel like my grieving period came as i realised that he and our relationship was changing into something that i couldn’t take anymore. but i do feel pretty lonely; i’m not used to being alone and even though i know i don’t want a relationship anytime soon not being in one is sort of frightening for me. i have reasonably bad social anxiety, i find it hard to speak to new people and sometimes in conversations i just feel myself blush and get really warm and stressed for no apparent reason and i know it’s probably very visible which makes me feel more uncomfortable. fear of this happening stops me from taking part in a lot of conversations and from talking to people generally. usually seeing my parents cheers me up but whenever i go home to see them i can just see how unhappy they are, my dad suffers from depression and my mum has admitted that she’s depressed too and i can feel the strain in their relationship and how absent minded-ly my dad can be a bit of a dick to her which is pretty sad to watch when my mum is such an angel.my job is ok, but it’s not always very fulfilling and everyday waking up to go in i feel this wave of only what i can describe as genuine depression']\n",

      "['my head. my brain just runs faster than usual. i cry, i try to watch porn to distract myself. but then i get high and everything goes away. it feels like relief, beauty, calm and a complete understanding of the world is just a step away. so i get high. my life perpetually fluctuates between the two and im not ashamed of myself or depressed about it. its just that i broke up with someone i wanted to be with but i was hesitant because of anxiety and depression. and now im using marijuana as a coping mechanism. trust me, i do work out. i do have a routine. im active but im very alone except my books. im afraid of anything new. im the sort of person who is comfortable losing ground slowly everyday. i get up and i fall down and i have been doing that for a long time. i guess that is what rest of the humans do as well. its just that my intensity is so so loud and sonorous. everyday i face trouble falling asleep and as if that was not enough, i get up with a sort of panic attack. i really want to kill myself over not saying \"thank you\" to my barista.im from india and i was dating someone really nice and i couldnt really take the right decision. ironically, i just wanted to have sex with someone white and im afraid of being caught soliciting these things. so for three years, i kept trying and then i told her one day that that is the only reason i am in america and she was hurt but she laughed at the same time too. and now she is dating someone else. which is okay, good for her. but im alone and i looked up the entire arranged marriage tradition. someone asked me on a date but as a filter they asked me my educational background and my family background. i noped the fuck out of it. so here i stand. i have no interest in things which the world has to offer to me. i honestly have a lot of passion in me for music, for books, for poetry, for meditation. im genuinely dedicated to figuring this shit out and im honestly ahead of a lot of people, thanks, in part, to therapy.but i have no real human connections. and i feel like its either weed or things like a genuine human connection. i mean, where have i come, with all the philosophy and psychology and self-improvement. yes, i meditated a lot. yes, i improved myself. i still have issues, that is true. but i understand myself well enough to say that its funny and depressing at the same time. life makes no sense. success, money, status make no sense. they have no correlation, at least for me, to happiness. i dont even mind being sad to be honest. but it looks like this is it. the only thing that i feel like adds some meaning to my life is love really. sure my job can add meaning, gym can add meaning, writers like virgina woolf can add meaning and ill keep them all with me. but essentially, im happiest when im in love. but what really is love given my condition? arranged marriage or tinder. so lets talk about an arranged marriage. i have to tell my family background to the family of the girl before i get to see her. and i live in seattle. it should be safe for me to not disclose these details and still be a nice person. because my family is composed of simple village-dwelling people. my parents are the sweetest people in the world but they are not successful, they dont have any accolades to show off. they still say that me and my brother are their biggest achievements, i mean the kind of people we have grown up as. they wont qualify any screening test and so wont i. now lets talk about tinder or neo-dating. im brown, im fit but im not athletic. im decent looking but im no rockstar. i write nice messages to everyone on okcupid. i do feel frustrated at times but i still am not rude to anybody for their choice of not liking me. i get it. but where does that put me? three years. not a single good friend. and its getting worse. i have lost my energy to want to impress people. and neither do i expect this from someone. i know im not a 10. i usually dont message anybody out of my league. the only people i dont message are people who i am not attracted to at all. and i guess the people who reject me are coming from a similar position. but it essentially creates capitalism out of dating. i dont want sex. i dont want anything hot. or a person who hikes. i just someone who likes me. and i would genuinely try to make it work. i wont reject someone because they dont have a wanderlust or if they are a recovering alcoholic. do other people see dating in this way? in my experience, a lot of us dont.i meditated. i wrote my journals. i read amazing books. i watched amazing shows and movies. i learnt to make music. i learnt to appreciate all kinds of music. i became well versed in philosophy. i am on my journey to become fairly well versed in psychology. i got healthy and i ran for miles. people say that im intelligent and creative. but at the same time, i got a pornhub premium subscription. i have smoked weed almost everyday for the past two years. my career makes no sense. i developed a bit of an eating disorder. i broke up with my best friend and my girlfriend. i want to go back to india but where exactly? thats a shitty feeling you know. the home no longer exists. when people tell me that im intelligent and creative, i think they are just saying it. they dont mean it. i see that the problem here is with self-esteem. i see all my problems very clearly. i still cant fix them. my hands go automatically to weed, then to my penis and then to pornhub. i constantly lie to myself and also to others. thats the depressing']\n",

      "['my parents, girlfriend, friends etc. i was doing really well in life. i barely felt depression, i was exercising regularly, meditating, eating well. my therapist told me that hes honestly in awe with the amount of progress ive made in the month i was away. my girlfriend stopped talking to me the moment i flew back from her. for a almost a month she kept saying that shes depressed. so i gave her space. when she tried to talk to me in the night, i said you can rather sleep because youre not feeling well. now i was worried what is up with her. she would see my message and not reply back and i distinctly remember that i couldnt sleep two nights because of all this. i was finally kicking depressions ass. and ive been fucking depressed forever. self-harm, hygine, i check every single box when it comes to depression. but i was kicking it. for the first time in my life. i wanted to go back to school, i wanted to do so much more. but now my gf, to whom i was supposed to marry next year says she doesnt see me as a relationship.it hurts but it hurts in so many different ways. im afraid that i live in an area where statistically speaking, the odds are not in my favor. and even if the odds were just fine, i dont really like dating. i like being in a relationship with someone built around trust, validation and love. and im 27 already and i dont know if its too late because i get depressed fairly easily when theres nobody to comfort me. and it feels as if this will be the start of another long and painful episode of depression and ill lose another year of my life and along with it, health, hair, energy and sense of happiness.i really liked her. i really liked the kind of person she had been and the kind of personal she makes me feel like. i feel so much better around her and not in a validating way either. depression, support groups and other forms of self-improvement has made me very self-aware of human behavior and biases. so honestly, she could not validate me because she was just not up for the jedi mind tricks and rhetorics i was pulling out. but i genuinely enjoyed helping her out. i helped her with her educational finances because i really didnt want her to give up on her dream. and now hearing from her life is too short for compromises with a smiley face in the end just makes me super mad. life is indeed about compromises. its about the kind of compromises you can live with. something that might be compromising in one way but rewarding in the other. and it makes me mad that she feels this way. im not going to correct her, im not mad at her at breaking up with me. she is her own person and good for her. i just care too much about her and she and i both have nurtured both of us, and how we view relationships and trust. and to see her take such a u-turn makes me feel really sad. the depression']\n",

      "['my life was honestly perfect looking back. had my beautiful house in a nice neighborhood i’d ride my bike in every day. had my parents who even though i’m not as close as i’d like to be were there. had two of the most amazing women in that roof too, my sisters. had a few friends, one that was most dearest to me. and the cherry on top, my girlfriend, the person that, about to be ten months together, i love with all my heart.i was extremely happy. the happiest i’ve ever been. and then everything changed. it all started slowly, when my gymnastics class got shut down. it sucked, i loved going there and the people there, it hit hard. then i had to move to another city for college, and i’ve been so depressed ever since i came here.i moved into a tiny house, just me and only one of my sisters, i have a different bed that is not as soft as my bed back in town. but what really makes me depressed is the fact that i feel like everything that made me happy was just taken away. i don’t have my bed, i don’t have my room, i don’t leave said room and see my little sister in hers, i don’t walk downstairs and see my mom in the kitchen, i don’t see my dad fixing whatever he can around the house, i don’t take my girlfriend on dates every weekend, i don’t kiss her every time i see her in the hallway, i don’t get to touch her often. i don’t anymore.my girlfriend, my beautiful girlfriend that every single day i thank the universe for, the only person i’ve ever loved as much in my life, the prettiest girl in the universe, is the part that hits the hardest. we have a very physical relationship, holding hands, kisses, hugs, and even though she doesn’t exactly love it,  tickles, she just reacts so cutely. and with me moving she’s also been down. it’s been hard. weeks before i left were just filled with sadness and uncertainty, and when i came here we were counting down the day we’d see each other again.  again, it’s been hard, so damn hard.the reason for the tittle is that i feel like i can’t be happy how i want to, i have to wait weeks to see my parents and my girlfriend for just one day because it would be so expensive to so every weekend. i can’t do what i love. my birthday is coming up, and my girlfriend can’t (for a reason that i completely understand) come, my parents might, and i don’t know if my new friends. i feel miserable, i spend my nights thinking \"why did you have to come here?\"i can’t stand having to tell my girlfriend that it’ll be weeks until i see her again, last time it was a month. i can’t stand the feeling that my parents are investing so much money for my education and that i might screw up. i can’t stand feeling so embarrassed by not texting my friends. i can’t stand that sometimes i just can’t literally afford being happy. they say money doesn’t buy you happiness, but it would certainly that bus ticket to see my girl, to go to the trampoline park and how i like to call it, flip the pain away.i can’t stand crying myself to sleep i hate not being able to be happy the way i want to and that depression makes it worse. i have so very few things that make me happy here with me. i miss my perfect life.i’m studying because i want to change that, but coming here has just made everything harder. i really hate what’s been doing to my girlfriend and i constantly feel like i’m hurting her even though she says it’s not my fault, i just don’t want to hurt her. i feel miserable knowing that my little sister is just alone with my mom. i feel bad that my dad is alone in another city.as i write this, it’s midnight and i’m crying here in my bed. debating whether i should at the very least show to my girlfriend. i feel powerless,i feel like i can’t be as happy as i was.tl;dr moved to a new city for school, depression']\n",

(i wish i could see a doctor or therapist, as well; however, my parents blow over every request i make to see one, since either a.) its a waste of money or b.) mental illness is all in your head).going back to my brother, he had an hour long conversation about my attitude and my depression']\n",

      "['my first large entry on reddit. it is really hard to summarize everything that happens in my messed up head, but i can try.i don’t have many memories until i was 8, except for the fact that i was a fully happy child, always kinda quiet and reclusive, but plenty happy. i had a lot of friends and family attention, i had lots of dreams, but everything started to turn in december 1, 2001. five days before my 8 year old birthday, my dad dies. it was a really rare disease, i can’t even name it (and for some reason i really never wanted to know exactly what it was). but all i remember was seeing my old man, who was a physical educator, getting weaker and weaker. as a child who have never had contact to death, i wasn’t understanding it very well. all i knew was that he was going to be ok. that didn’t happened. he was my role model. but who could tell that 2002 was one of the best years of my life? i felt so warmed by all of my family that moment. it was a rough time for everybody, but we united. i remember every night sleeping in the same room with my mom and my little brother. i felt protected. our grandparents really helped us financially (and still do, as they paid mine and my brother’s college). but, in 2003, my mom met my stepfather, and, from there, things just became worse and worse.  i had no problems with him for the next 2 years. i kinda liked him. he was not my father, but i liked him. we used to play soccer games together in the ps2. but after some time his attitude changed. he became more… explosive?i was becoming a teenager and i always had something of a dark humor (not the racist/mysoginist/homophobic shit, but still dark humor). one day, he almost broke up with my mom after i made a joke calling him poor (he always had this strange money obsession, he really thinks he is rich, but we are just middle class). as a kid i was really confused with all of that, but that escalated. one day, going to the beach for the weekend, i got spanked in the car by my mom as my stepfather cheered it while driving. the motive was another joke that i made, about my stepfather shitting his pants (yeah he used to do that and leave the shitty underwear behind the bathroom door). that day was too much, too much for me and still terrifies me when i remember. i had never got beaten until that day. my cousin and my brother were in the car too. nobody did nothing to stop that.from that day on, my relationship with my mom went in a downward spiral of beating and shouting. for anything. the result? bad grades, isolation, tries with tobacco, alcohol and marijuana (at 13, 14 and 15yo respectivelly)... the whole family structure tumbled down. even today, i can’t communicate properly with my mom since i evolved a serious blockage. i don’t speak to my stepfather for more than 10 years, even living under the same roof. and it fucking messes with me.but, besides the experimentations with drugs and stuff, my teenage years were kinda normal. out of my house, i was a pretty confident person. i still had many friends (maybe not the best guys, but still friends), i had 3 girlfriends between 2008 and 2011, doing good enough to enter the journalism university… life was going on but, still, something was growing inside of me.my university didn’t helped a lot. i didn’t made any friends. it was not a campus, but just a cold, grey, boring building just downtown (still, academically, one of the best journalism colleges here in brazil). but after that, i got a freelance job at one of the biggest newspapers here in my state, so i thought the objective was accomplished.but i couldn’t avoid the troubles in my house, that kept going. so, in my time with my friends, i was really into drugs and alcohol and i spent several years in this. i feel like it was a time bomb, and, one day… boom. my first panic attack. it was a time that i was into cocaine and using it pretty much, every week. after that, i haven’t touched any synthetic drugs, even though i’m still pretty addicted to marijuana. one month after, i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. things were never the same.i got treatment, i got therapy, i had medicine, i tried to exercise, i tried to stop smoking pot and cigarettes. i tried pretty much what people tell us to do, but i failed in everything. from then on, every shit that happened to me seemed to hurt like 10x more. i broke up with a lot of people since then. even with all of this, i always tried to help my friends, all of them have similar problems, one of them even told me i saved his live with support during a anxiety attack. but i feel like nobody give a fuck about me. nobody ask how am i doing. nothing. not even a message.i got dispensed from my job after disagreements with my toxic disgusting fucking boss. and, last year, i decided to take my money and make my first travel outside the country, just by myself. surprisingly, in the middle of the darkness, i had the most legitimate moment of happiness i ever had. i spent 1 month around the coast of california. the 3 weeks i had in san diego were just magical. i met so many wonderful people and felt so welcomed. but, as it ended and i found myself in my mediocre life again, my happiness ended also.it has been rough, rough times. in the last 19 months i lost everything. at least, the little i still had. i broke up with basically all of my friends. i lost confidence. i feel like i can’t get outside my bedroom without being anxious. i’m terrified by panic attacks. i started to fear life and the outside world. i lost all interest in hobbies i once had. i lost my family because, in my head, my stepfather stole it from me. i lost the job i still had because of depression']\n",

(same thing with relationships but thats another story altogether...) my experience has been the opposite.i always knew what i wanted to do with my life. since i was about 10 or 11. its difficult to have discovered your passion so young (or at all, i believe). its funny how certainty can breed frustration in that way. everything else has changed entirely - even my very body and mind - except for that one thing.it can be comforting at times, for sure. sometimes when im surrounded by turmoil it can be nice to listen to the songs i loved when i was young. its effectively just like stepping in a time machine and travelling back there but without having to deal with all the painful parts of the past.im grateful for that indeed, but as i said, its hard having a constant thread in life. its exhausting and very often disappointing. being passionate about something (or some*one* for that matter) makes you really vulnerable to being hurt. im not just referring to criticism, be it internal or external... its like being naked and exposed in a way. its as if you have no way of covering up or protecting yourself because that would be to erase the fact that you are passionate. its kinda like the end of the trial - pink floyd. having a passion or enthusiasm for something is like the judge and the crowd yelling \"tear down the wall! tear down the wall!\" but all of it being completely silent and only inside your own head.now obviously this will sound like a complete exaggeration to most. im aware of that. i dont know if this is something unique to the modern world or if it always existed, but i feel like people who care alot about one thing are alienated. youre supposed to be well balanced in your interests and if not then youre just \"weird\". nobody likes to hear about one thing for any length of time or think about it deeply. after a certain point its \"enough now\" and onwards to the next thing. and i just get the impression that everyone is always skipping the track right before the really good part starts!but anyway, it doesnt really matter what others think or say. most passionate people are their own worst critics. even if you were in a room full of people praising you, it would still be possible to feel like a failure. fulfillment can only ever come from within and its a bloody difficult thing to achieve.i know that the only way to do that is to accept what you have and what you are. gratitude is also helpful, not just for the blessing but for the obstacles too. but why is it so hard to be supportive of and encouraging to myself? it comes so easily towards others, what makes me different?i know that thats a pretty standard experience in depressed people. i have made alot of progress in encouraging myself in other areas of life. however when it comes to my main interest i still struggle to feel adequate and worthy.i think one of the main reasons is that most people often put their younger selves down and dismiss who they used to be. theyre too afraid to empathise with their past selves. instead they call them naïve, immature or just plain stupid. but i dont do that. not anymore at least. i can laugh at my younger self, definitely! but i never belittle, insult or demean my past selves. theyre still a part of me after all. back then i did the best i could with what i knew at the time and i have to respect that.i feel really good when i notice something that would make my younger self feel proud. each time that i accomplish something that i only ever dreamed of doing before, it just fills my heart right up. :) thats why i trust the instincts i had as a kid. after all i did, amongst some other things, have fantastic taste in music for a 13 year old.if that little girl could meet me as i am now, i reckon shed think im pretty cool. that means alot to me. all the thoughts and feelings in my head right now would make no sense to her whatsoever. shed definitely love my tattoo as well. i definitely feel a sense of responsibility to make her proud because i had a really difficult, really shitty childhood. my depression']\n",

      "['my fair share of fun in relationships. i was confident, passionate, creative, enjoyed networking and had a great career ahead. but now - career going nowhere, not even close to fulfilling my potential and losing interest in work (which means constant stress and anxiety). also lacking the confidence to make any changes, mainly because i have pretty much lost my life outside of work - no friends left, lost my social skills, and the youthful bravado, fire and passion i had before. how do i go about rediscovering my old self? how do i find some sort of joy and hope to get better in life? at least can someone relate and share their experiences? **here’s what happened:** i had a series of bad jobs with toxic work environments in the last few years. this meant extra hours in the evenings and weekends cleaning up after others’ mistakes, and even when i was free i would be mentally and emotionally drained to face my friends. i began to isolate myself and slowly my support group thinned and disappeared (i myself even pushed some away due to growing shame). i was also repeatedly passed over for recognition and promotion despite giving *so, so much* to work (to be honest, much more than what my colleagues did) and i got absolutely nothing in return. which means that today i am far short of my potential. i’m stuck in yet another job around people who don’t know much about anything (nor do they care) while my ex-colleagues have progressed in their careers to high-paying jobs and influential, valuable networks. this unfairness frustrates and demoralises me and makes me question why i’m even bothering in life. what got me through the tough times in the previous jobs was spending time with my old friends and support groups, and my interests outside of work. i kept reminding myself that it was \"just a job\", and the real joy was in doing my own things i was passionate about like startups, tech, gadgets, photography, games, and music. but i’ve got no friends or support groups anymore, i’ve even become a stranger in the interest groups i used to be part of. it kills me to realise that while my interests got sucked out by work, others who may have been less gifted have kept at it and made a name for themselves as influential in these circles. my physical fitness also has nosedived, with bad habits like smoking, alcohol, junk food, junk online content and porn. my appearance is shabby — i even skip shower and shaving some days. i’ve tried to go out and make new friends from scratch but as it is this is difficult at my age. and with my sense of humour and social skills becoming almost non-existent after going through the last few years’ experiences, im finding it near impossible to be jovial or even smile. i’ve tried online dating sites and tinder for relationships but have found no luck (i’m average looking). heck i can’t even look at a girl now due to the shame i feel when i think how less experienced and fun i might be than guys 10 years younger than me. and no, it doesn’t help to say sign up for an activity that i like doing because like i said, i’ve lost interest in most things. i can’t even seem to relax and find a few minutes to take my mind off work and watch a tv show or something without feeling stressed and anxious about my future.  i’ve thought of  changing jobs again and even saw some really good positions i would be great for, but can’t muster up the confidence to go through the job search. and besides, what if the next one is even worse? i even thought of doing my own thing outside work and network around to freelance or start something up on my own. i’m good at convincing people and selling myself when i’m inspired and when i have belief in my capabilities but my low self-esteem and self-doubt is proving to be a mental block.how do i get out of thus rut and back on my feet? how do i improve myself at work, and at the same time find hope and joy in other things before i spiral into a hole i can’t get out of? how do find joy and live happily and free of fear, anxiety and depression']\n",

      "['myself from the beginning that i am sort of an unlucky person when it comes to finances or capital gain. yet, i can give ridiculous tips that worked out well for others, but never for myself. 3 months ago, i was at a crappy work place but filled with great colleagues who then became friends. here, i didnt have anything to worry as everything was done as a team. we joked and talked throughout the entire day, and still get the work done to the envy of other teams.as i needed to further my career, i then moved to a new workplace a month later, with a better salary, having spent at least 5 years at my previous job. however, that turned out to be one of the horrible decision i made in life. filled with depressing work scope, and colleagues who do not communicate much other than using a headphone from 9am-6pm, it made me isolate myself to a place i never felt comfortable. i have no one to channel my guilt or feelings other than my girlfriend and close friends.two of my close friends are married and settled down, both of whom are quite well to do. i considered myself as a failure when compared to any of the two. one of them works in a big industry and has no intention to leave as he brings back roughly 6 figures yearly for the past 5-6 years. ever since then, he has been interested in passive income and does trading. recently, he introduced trading via an expert advisor and his own methodology to which he has been consistently profiting around $2k a month with the initial capital of $5k.it may not sound much but his philosophy is to withdraw the capital and trade using the profits, and does that for quite a while, prolly close to 10 years. he has other friends and members of their family who trades as little as $500 or as much as $10k and their returns were consistent. knowing the game plan was not to get rich but more of generating passive income without much capital, as well as having much faith in him and his methods, i placed myself $2k and made about $1k over two months (ups and downs).you may call it naive or any other synonym but i took the plunge and added in an additional $8k last week hoping to at least maintain or generate a tidy amount of profit with a much more minimal draw-down. this was done after a thorough review of demo accounts and months of deliberation (even before i had placed the initial $2k). thus, any profits made, regardless how small it is, i was hoping to withdraw it on a monthly basis for my marriage and house fund. however, today, due to the flash crash of the market, both my accounts and the profit were wiped out. all gone within an hour.i dont take much solace in knowing that the market affected others as well. ironically, my friends account wasnt affected as he didnt turn it on. and the other, had a close shave as he withdrew his profits of about $6k. nonetheless, he still lost around $4k profits of his entire account earlier. i dont know if this sadness is causing depression']\n",

 well, maybe.  it was an experiment where they gave you 2 infusions: one is actually ketamine, the other is placebo (saline, i think).but i got k the first time.  of course i cant say that with 100% certainty, because they never revealed which was which, but i was seeing shapes and colors and trails and was saying that i couldnt control my mouth and words were being spoken through me rather than by me.  the second time i felt nothing at all, so judge for yourself.however, even though i experienced the k, i didnt actually feel better.  i only started to feel better when they put me on zyprexa, which amazingly stopped my social anxiety.  then i started talking to other people in the trial, and making some friends.  i was still depressed but was functional.i went home around thanksgiving.  i had started running and cooking while at nih, and tried to keep that up at home.  i wasnt happy, but i was talking, and that was a start.  i was still basically a nervous wreck, but i got an interview for a coding job, did really well, and got the job (for some reason im never nervous at interviews).  i spent the first month at that job almost puking from anxiety every day, but i made some friends with the smokers, and i realized that it wasnt so bad.  plus it was easy.  plus i could move into my own place now!but i still wasnt happy.  however, one of the other people from the ketamine clinical trial apparently had wonderful results with k and started http://www.ketamineadvocacynetwork.org/ to promote its use as an antidepressant.  i found a doctor near me who administered it, and called him up.  when he heard i was in the clinical trial, he set me up with an appointment (i guess because id basically been pre-screened by the government).i got a series of 5 infusions.  each time i tripped balls.  i mean, ive done drugs, but this was about as wild as it gets.  however, it was different from other experiences, in that i felt like i could experience my mind from outside of itself.  like i could analyze it without judgement, and change it without fear.right after the first infusion, i felt a burst of energy and went running (when i got home).  the next day, everything felt lighter, easier, like it was a game.  these feelings intensified after each infusion, and i gradually thought i had a \"cheat code\" for life.this seems appropriate; its from an interview with donald glover:> glover said that he thinks of reality as a program and his talent as hacking the code: “i learn fast—i figured out the algorithm.” grasping the machine’s logic had risks. “when people become depressed and kill themselves, it’s because all they see is the algorithm, the loop,” he said. but it was also exhilarating. when he was ten, he said, “i realized, if i want to be good at p.e., i have to be good at basketball. so i went home and shot baskets in our driveway for six hours, until my mother called me in. the next day, i was good enough that you wouldn’t notice i was bad. and i realized my superpower.”anyway, that was about 4 years ago.  i now have a prescription for ketamine, which i take at maintenance levels.  ive gone through a lot of bad shit in those 4 years, but ive taught myself how to become resilient (the trick is to go through bad stuff a lot...bend but dont break).  i try to help other people by facilitating dbsa meetings and talking about my life.  i also started volunteering at habitat for humanity because physical effort is good and its good karma.my life isnt perfect.  im not dating anyone, and im worried that its a bad idea to date me because in the past ive fallen into depressions']\n",

      "['my online friend who lives a few hours away has had a hard life, depression and suicidal thoughts. shes already attempted suicide at one point in the past, although i dont know details. in her adult life shes only ever met people who have either outright rejected her when they found out she had this illness, or treated her differently because of it. in meeting her online, ive become her *only* support system for this horrible illness. she doesnt know any good irl friends, and her boyfriend, though seemingly genuinely a great guy in all other respects, has deep-seated problems with talking about mental illness. she cuts herself and although meeting me has helped her because i treat her the way she should be treated, i think she would benefit a lot from a bigger support system, and treatment for depression.the first problem with this is that shes become incredibly wary of telling people about her depression, understandably, and sees herself as nothing but a waste of space who deserves to die. shes told me that it would be extremely unfair to introduce people to her problems because she has an \"expiration date\", and that shes going to be sad for the rest of her life anyway and theres nothing she can do about it. she hopes she dies so she doesnt suffer more, and she doesnt want to make other people suffer by telling them. she has a huge discord that she runs where shes friends with all the regulars there, except they dont know. if she told them, they would completely, 100% support her, but again, see above. her boyfriend is the same problem, see above.the second problem is that she needs treatment. pills, therapy, but a) she has ocd about money, and shes poor-ish. even if she didnt think it was a waste to pay for treatment in the first place, her ocd makes it so that she has a hard time spending large amounts of money. she doesnt even look at her bank account half the time because it upsets this part of her. i have ocd myself and this isnt an easy thing to overcome. also, b), i dont know what resources she could potentially access that would be free or cheap.i will take *any* advice, help or resources. she lives in south carolina, if that helps. she and i talk pretty much all day every day except when i work, and although i genuinely love talking to her as much as we do, shes incredible in every way, i feel like the only way shes going to get better past what i can help with by being there, is if she opens up to more people, makes that connection, especially with her boyfriend, and seeks treatment. but i dont know how to do any of those things without forcing her, even though i have brought them up multiple times. these issues are too big for me alone to be able to remedy, i think, even if i can help her by being there for her in the now.please, depressed people, friends of depressed people, *anybody*, i will take any assistance or guidance. i just want to help her live the good life she deserves to live because i love her.-----------------------------------------------------------so i have an online friend who has depression and suicidal thoughts/tendencies, on top of having a hard life in the past and obsessive compulsive tendencies.im ocd myself, but even though ive never really been truly happy with my life to any degree until like this year, and ive been *depressed* for really long periods, i have scars on my arms, the whole deal, i dont believe i have clinical depress*ion*. but my reason for asking for help goes a bit deeper than that.**this will be sort of long, but bear with me please**, im sorry. i really could use some advice and resources.the situation is that i met her probably a month or more ago online through a discord. we just really started hitting it off and although i normally shy away from excessive conversation with new people i meet, ive been in a rough patch the last few months myself and i wasnt really thinking about it.the reason i try not to do that is because i have emotional dependent tendencies. ive self regulated since ive realized i had them, and they dont really show up anymore, but multiple times in my life, to varying degrees of severity, ive become emotionally dependent on someone.so we started talking more and more and since those first few days, we have literally been talking all day every day. now, obviously, this sounds fucking horrible because again, i have the history of dependency (one time it happened was literally with an online friend where we talked 100% of the time), and shes depressed.but the reason weve been doing this is because she *needs* it, from what i can gather. i learned very quickly into us talking about random stuff that she has shitty family, depression, she mentioned her boyfriend hiding sharp objects from her and i mean, hey, i self harmed before, so i offered to help if she needed someone to talk to about that, and now its a whole thing. long story short she grew up in a *horrible* family situation and was mostly isolated from anyone she could ever confide in and trust as a person. in addition to that, shes 20 and somehow every single friend shes met in her adult life has either treated her differently once theyve learned she has the thoughts she does, or left her entirely. fake friends. its *really* fucked up and i honestly dont know how that even could have happened. i feel so bad for her.the only exception is her boyfriend, who she says is a loving, wonderful person - except hes deathly allergic to talking about mental illness. she thinks this is because *his* family was/is also shitty, and hes always just had trouble with that sort of issue. it makes him uncomfortable and he doesnt know how to deal with it. i realize that doesnt make him sound like a good person at all, but i think shes self aware enough that she would know if she was in an actually abusive/bad relationship. i honestly believe her when she says hes a good person (to the degree he can be with this in mind, whatever), but that doesnt change the fact that even *he* doesnt help her with this stuff, despite him knowing. and shes too...shes not a docile person, but shes very cautious about talking about mental illness. this isnt the kind of thing she would feel comfortable bringing up again to him.*so with all of this in mind*, after knowing this girl for maybe a month and a half, ive become her *only* support system.you do not have to remind me how absolutely horrible of an idea it is for someone to only have *one* person as a mental health support system, but the thing is, i dont know what to do. thats why im making this post, and why i felt all that context was necessary.im too tired to format this better, but as an aside, *no*, i have not developed an emotional dependency on her. ive taken steps mentally to not do that and i just want to make it clear that honestly, shes just a new friend to me, who just happens to need help on a regular basis. im not going to deny her that help.i mean, this girl is *literally the nicest person ive ever met*. like, i genuinely dont even think she has any bad qualities whatsoever. shes funny, sweet, caring...shes amazing. i genuinely enjoy talking to her as much as i do. i find it shocking she, of all people in the world, could think that anything is wrong with her. i could go on for hours. shes just so pure and good.so i talk to her and be a good friend, which is really what she needs in life in general - she tells me a lot how she doesnt think im even real because im so nice, but im honestly just acting like normal me and doing what any good person would. like i said, shes met bad, shitty people, and i care about her. so when she tells me that shes not real, or shes nothing but a waste of space who deserves to die, or that shes this terrible monster whos a burden just by existing and she should just jump off her balcony right now, i comfort her and help her. or i try to. the wall im running into, which i shouldve realized slightly sooner, is that there is only so much i *can* help. i have ocd, so my mentality subconsciously is to try and straight up *fix* problems, and ive realized i have a big tendency to try and make her feel better explicitly, instead of just talking to her like i would anyone else. it isnt necessarily *bad*, but i know that overdoing it would be, and i dont want to do that. i just want to help, but even when i do my best, sometimes it just doesnt affect her whatsoever and all i can do is be there for her. we watch movies on rabbit sometimes and were planning voice chats and stuff, but.the final bit of context here is that she owns the discord we met on. its a community full of people from different places, and shes friends with practically all of them. but her isolation is in that she feels uncomfortable telling people about her depression']\n",

i miss being in complete aww, just taking in a moment of beauty.. you know what i see with a phone.. a bill.. a reminder that no one’s texted me, an outlet that means you are connected to the world, 24/7, never getting a break.. i check it.. no matches on tinder either aha why the fuck did i even sign up for that?..it comes time for dinner and we had your favorite.. cooked ham with that string bean casserole my aunt makes. it wasn’t as good as the years passed, but i think it was only because you weren’t there to remind me how good it was.. you would have psyched because i think she even added extra onion straws we’re eating around the table and i’m sitting at the head, because everyone wanted to sit next to their so’s, and there was only one chair at the end.. i volunteer as tribute, because why not? let them enjoy the time.. i know it’s not that big a deal, and they wouldn’t even mind, but things just happened that way..i think that’s where i made the mistake.. pretty much just asking to be talked to by those relatives who i only see three times a year..then it happened.. i hadn’t seen or talked to these relatives in a long time“hey dugefrsh, where’s [my girlfriend]? at her parents today? i made extra casserole just for her!”it’s kind of cliche to say especially because people say it a lot.. but it was like a scene from a movie..the kitchen becomes pretty quiet and she could tell she messed up and gave me a sad look to say i’m sorry. how was she supposed to know? it’s okayi play it off and just smile “ haha she’s doing well, her and her mother are on vacation this week i believe, so they’re out of state”the sigh of brief relief that swept over her face didn’t last long and she kept asking about her and telling me how cute she was and how she was so much fun to talk to..the line that hurt most was when she said she fit in perfect with our family..“she was perfect i know aunty”and it’s sort of my fault too i guess, i could have just told her that we’re not together anymore and been done with it, but i didn’t want to embarrass her finally my dad coughed and i told her we were no longer seeing each other anymore..play it off coy, everyone gets back to chatting and the situation rolls over.. i don’t usually drink a red wine, but we were out of white and i didn’t want a beer. i sat there at the head of the table playing with a bowl of jellybeans, and i even picked out all the black ones and put them off to the side, sort of like i was saving them for you.. i can’t believe you liked those you weirdo hahai finally had a moment without thinking about you today though.. the bruins game was on and was a welcome distraction; that and the alcohol was helpingwhen the game finishes up all the kids want to watch frozen.. i can’t do that..when i would sing do you wanna build a snowman to you and you’d laugh.. i can’t do it..thankfully though my parents wanted to leave.. as i’m in the back seat again, the pulsing of the passing street lamps make it a little hard to close my eyes.. when i’m staring at the stars, it’s such a lame, grandiose and romanticized way of thinking, but i knew they were the same stars that you were looking at.. it hit me that that was one time i was in aww.. looking at stars with you..after i finish this drink, i’m gonna try and get some rest though..if i’m lucky i’ll just pass out and don’t have to cry too long..maybe i’ll start the moving on process?.. it’s never taken me this long to get over someone..maybe i’ll try it in the morning.. maybe tomorrow will be the day i beat this stupid depression']\n",

      "['my mum doesnt give a shit about me and my mental health. im not saying this because i feel like she doesnt care, im saying this because of various reasons, like: when i had my very first mental breakdown and spent 15 days crying in bed and sleeping without moving the only thing she did was telling me \"think about starving kids in africa theyre doing worst than you\" and then put the dog on my bed instead of conforting me herself. at that point i asked her to see a therapist. she allowed me to do that but, like she always does, she started to make me feel extremely guilty about the fact that we couldnt afford even that upon the other expences and telling me things like \"we have to pay your therapist so i dont know if well have money to go grocery shopping\". we had money for both since my father a month later bought a fucking vehicle for 3.000€, but still. shes always been like that.at first i though she didnt know what to do with depression and how to deal with someone who is depressed (which is very strange, considering her older brother passed away in an accident when she was around my age, which is 21/22, and that is the kind of thing that would probably make you feel depressed i guess), so i just forgave her and tried to pick myself up the best i could. then my brother had his breakdown, started hearing voices that werent there, stopped sleeping, started yelling in the middle of the night and writing stuff on the walls with a pen. of course my anxiety at this point got super bad, cause thing were basically falling apart with my ex, i had to give exams, i couldnt function and i was waking up at seven am by my mother who asked me to scrape off the words my brother wrote on the walls \"as quietly as you can\". i did. while having and anxiety crisis all the time i spent on the wall with a sponge erasing threats against every single member of my family of \"gutting us like animals\". then she became, like, *the best mum ever.* always there to give him support, always rushing over him and worrying, asking him stuff, trying her best to be close to him. and i got so mad, cause she was capable of being next to my brother, then why did she teated me the way she did in the past? then i realized. of course she didnt stayed close to me when i was ill: everything was going great with her. she only worried about me when she needed comfort and if i couldnt provide that because i was sick then she would \"worry\" (by which i mean making me feel guilty because i couldnt take no more). i went to live with my grandma for january cause i was super done with dying in anxiety and crying three hours per day when i wad okay, i needed a place to stay calm or i would just go insane. she helped me pack and gave me the key of the car, told me to have a \"nice trip\" and went back inside to check my brother.i went to my grandmas house crying hysterically and i didnt stop for hours. i just cried and cried until i was too exhausted and i slept. the morning after i told my ex-boyfriend that i was way too depressed to get out of bed and i couldnt see him and i was very sorry. he got angry (yeah, he was emotionally abusive as fuck, maybe one day ill write the story but he fucked me up pretty badly mentally), and i just shutted my phone up, got into bed and started writing suicide notes to my friends and my grandma. once i finished i realized that i couldnt go to the bathroom, let alone go to the top of a building and jump off.so i decide that i need medicine and i need therapy asap. where i live we have free healthcare, so i ask my mum to come with me to take the appointment with the psychiatrist. he saw me, diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and we started with medicines.my mum never asked me how it was. she never asks about medicines, my health, how im doing. the medicine arent working still and i never took that many pills in a lifetime, but she doesnt even notice that. she discovered i wad being medicated when i told my older brother about it in the living room and she reacted with a \"okay\". just an okay.i told her my diagnosis when i was hysterically crying because i just broke things off with my ex and she kept talking to me about what my father did that day that was *so wrong and shitty * she just didnt care that i was sobbing in the car next to her. what she told me? \"oh you think *im* not depressed?\"then just kept on telling me how bad she was feeling and how life was cruel to her.meanwhile here i am, all alone at 21 years of age, with basically nothing cause my parents managed to burn down every single piece of property they couldve left to us, with a broken brain since i was so little i litteraly cannot remember when it started precisely, five attempted suicides. and my mum just wants to talk about how she fucked up her own life and she feels miserable about it. after i told my psychiatrist this he told me to go live to my grandmas, because my house was way too toxic and i could never improve there. i kept staying there for a while cause i felt guilty about living my brothers and my mum alone, but then my little brother (the one that probably has schizophrenia, but nobody in my family is willing to accept the problem and do something about it) almost punched me in the face because i asked him how he was doing.i am very petite girl with zero muscles cause i hate sports, my brother has harms as big as my head basically. he couldve busted badly my face in a matter of seconds, but luckly for me i have good reflexes, so i avoided it for the most part. he bruised my face though.i told my mum what happened via text and she didnt reply. she didnt say anything. than she said that i should be patient with my brother whom is *very sick and very angry.* that was the day i moved into my grandmas house and my mum thinks it is only because i am mad at her for no reason. like my whole life revolves around how she feels and what she wants. because she taught me that i can never feel bad or sad or angry when she is, she is the important one that needs to talk. i am the one that is supposed to listen to her problems since i was in elementary school. she litteraly took me from class when i was 8 to show me how badly my father punched her in the face. im sorry for the long posts, but i have a lot of shit im going through and im basically quitting every relationship with my mum whatsoever because of this. i just need her to give me money, cause she is supposed to and she promised me and i am in uni and cannot work because of my depression (my psychiatrist basically begged me not to find a job cause it would only make me feel worst). when ill feel better i will work my butt of and be indipendent and never speak to her ever again. but the fact is that i am dropping someone that to me was my *hero.* i love my mum so much, she can be kind and amazing and she protected me when my father wanted to kick the shit out of me, she tried to raise me alone the best she could and i just cant leave her behind without feeling like i have lost everything in my life. i feel like i hav nothing and i need to build an empire all by myself without the help of anybody, while having no arms and no idea of how to build said empire. everyday i think that dying would be the best option, but i cant die, i promised my best friend we would climb mount depression together and get to the top together.i just feel stuck in life. everyone that shouldve loved me no matter what just disappointed me again and again. my mum broke me to pieces and she doesnt even care. she has two sons and a doll that she can use however she wants, thats it. it sucks. it feels shitty to know that the person that choose to put you into this world just left you completely alone and was never there when you really needed that. now all she does is call me from time to time and tries to make me feel guilty about not helping her in our house and wanting to be here to do nothing. she knows i am depressed']\n",

(my mom left back in 2016 after her narcissistic, emotional abuse. shell tell you we kicked her out because she likes to be the victim.) i told her, lets get an apartment together so i can get away. we did. i remember being so anxious i dont even remember signing the lease because all i wanted to do was get home in my bedroom because i was afraid i was gonna faint from all the anxiety. i remember the anxiety passed and i started talking to my dad again and thinking straight and thinking \"what did i do?!\" i wanted to tell my mom that i didnt want to move out with her anymore. that i was not thinking rationally, that i was emotionally vulnerable. i didnt tell her because i knew she would flip. the previous night i was sleeping and i didnt answer her texts and she proceeded to text me 10 times in a row in capitals that i wasnt answering because i didnt want to move out with her and that i left her in the dust. i was sleeping. well, i ended up moving out with her because i had already messed up so i couldnt go back. i moved in and i fucking hated it. i spend 6 months, 7 floors up in a apartment with my mother. she doesnt drive so i couldnt leave and i hated asking my dad to take me out if i needed to do something because i knew that if i got anxious and wanted to go home i would just make him go out of his way to drive me back home. how selfish of me is that? a waste of gas. she would come home from work complaining that i didnt take the garbage out even when it wasnt full. not putting the soap back in the right place. her yelling at me because my sisters refused to talk to her or visit. making it all my issue and i had to fix it. i barely left the house i was so anxious and depressed']\n",

      "['my head. in october i went to a thanksgiving dinner 30 minutes away from home to my dad’s friends house. the people that were there were me, my sisters, my dad, my aunt and uncle (whom i don’t see very often) and my dad’s friend. i remember saying to myself that i didn’t want to go. at all. with my anxiety currently, being that far away from home without a quick escape (as it was 30 minutes away) then it made it harder. i wanted to make my dad proud and actually go to a family gathering for once so i sucked it up. the drive i was anxious but still able to be calm. i didn’t eat before going and i didn’t get a good amount of sleep the night before which is a precursor to trigger my anxiety. i should have stayed home. it was too much too soon. when we go there is when the anxiety kicked in. i knew i would get asked about my mom and how were getting along and i’d have to talk about it. she left the house in the summer of 2015 after her and my dad weren’t getting along and we thought it was best she leave due to her emotional abuse and narcissistic tendencies. it did not go well. she accused us of kicking her out when her father was the one who took her out of the house. anyways i think talking about my mom just made my anxiety worse. i could feel the anxiety rising and the thoughts start. “what if i get sick here in front of all these people?” “what if they think i’m weird for having a panic attack?” only a hour there and i wanted to tell my dad to drive me home. i didn’t because i couldn’t be weak again and just go home. i also didn’t want my dad to get mad and to ruin his time like i’ve done before. i sat on the couch and had a full panic attack. people know to leave my alone when i get like this. when im anxious i freeze up and can’t talk. i can only focus on one thing like a tv show. my sisters would come up and talk to me but another thing when i get anxious is my throat feels like its’ closing and i gag. i didn’t want them to see me do this. i would just nod and pretend i was okay. i couldn’t even think of dinner and having to eat in front of everyone. i just sucked it up while i could feel myself having what felt like a panic attack then it would subside then start up and then subside then start up. like hills or mountains. peaks and valleys. the best way i can describe it. absolute hell. i felt trapped with no way out and so far away from home. i remember going to the bathroom even though i hate going in other people’s houses. praying it wasn’t a bad poop (which would lead me to think i was sick and trigger my emetophobia) it was fine so that eased my mind. i ate what i could. some turkey and potatoes with a fake smile on my face, nodding and trying to converse all while feeling like my body was exploding on the inside from all the anxiety and adrenaline. again i’d be okay for a short while then it would spike. peaks and valleys. again, best way to describe it. it was finally winding down and my dad wanted to stay longer but i said “fuck no. i need to go home now.” on the drive home all i could think about was the anxiety. i’m literally having anxiety right now typing this just thinking about it. i was scared i was gonna throw up or faint or have a heart attack. dad was talking to me but all i was focused on was my anxiety and my body. i just wanted to get home to my room. i gagged violently in the car as my throat felt tight and my mouth dry. this would happen whenever my anxiety gets so intense. it was pretty bad when i was a kid. when we got home i had the worse depersonalization ever. my room looked foreign. i felt like i was in a daze. i assume my brain was overloading from all the anxiety. this only made it worse. i went to the bathroom and changed into my pyjamas and i laid down, put my computer and tv on and rode it out. that night was when it all started. the next day i had what i call a “panic attack hangover” i felt so tired, my muscles were tense. i slept horrible. waking up every so often with my heart racing in the middle of a anxiety attack. it’s like my body was full of adrenaline still. i was happy to be in my bed and my comfort zone when this was happening. my bedroom has been my safe haven for the past couple of years where i felt safe when i was anxious. my dad made food for dinner and even though anxiety, which depletes my appetite, was still present, i ate. i was still anxious. just wanted my bed and to lay down and watch tv on my laptop with all my comfort. a few hours later i had diarrhea. cue my brain into thinking i had a stomach virus that i caught or got sick from the food the night before. i rationally knew it was from all the anxiety as the anxiety puts my digestive tract into overdrive. i knew that but my irrational brain as i like to call it, didn’t. i was convinced i was sick which then put my anxiety into overdrive once again. all i felt for the next couple days was anxiety. i was scared to eat as maybe i was sick and food would make me throw up. i stuck to my bland diet which i do when i think i’m sick when really it’s anxiety fucking with my head. slowly the anxiety passed after a week. moments like that typically do even though this particular time what with thanksgiving and how bad that experience was, usually last about a week. i had my first therapist appointment on the 26th of october. the anxiety from thanksgiving was gone. i still had the thoughts of “what if” but those were always with my when i left the house. i was excited to start therapy again. the session went good. it was really just to get to know me. what meds im on ect. i told her about thanksgiving and how awful it was. she told me that it was good that i got through it. i agreed but i also thought to myself that i never want to feel that way again.i stopped to get a bagel after and went home. went on the internet and read a book. my sister got home and offered to make us some pasta. i was so tired so i told her if i fall asleep, wake me when it’s ready. i feel asleep so fast without even realizing it. what felt like 2 seconds later my sister woke up me up and told me dinner was ready. i started to feel that anxiety dread again. usually when i take naps in the daytime i wake up a little anxious and groggy. apparently my brain thought it was time to freak out to the extreme because i felt the daze feeling and the depersonalization again. i walked down and got myself some pasta even though it look revolting because once again, my anxiety gets rid of any appetite i have when it rears it’s ugly head. i ate the pasta and turned on netflix and grey’s anatomy. i put on something i’m familiar with when i’m anxious. it’ sort of a weird coping mechanism. i don’t know. this is when it allll started.i spent the night convinced that i woke up feeling like that because i was sick. always go to that conclusion. i hate my brain. i spent all night in and out of panic attacks just like i did during thanksgiving. i thought “oh hell no. i’m not feeling like this again.” and it sort of spiralled from there. i felt everything. afraid to eat because i might get sick which caused more anxiety. loose stools from anxiety even though i know anxiety caused it but more convincing to my irrational brain that i was sick. it wasn’t anxiety. this kept happening. it all snowballed and i wanted it to stop. for some reason i started to feel like i did when i was 13. there was this one point where something like this happened that was similar. i would gag and get afraid to eat. i dry heaved over the sink. my anxiety was awful. my mom was there and she would help and cut me up apples to get me to eat. i would lay on the couch next to her. i started to say “i want my mom.” i thought she would know how to make it better. like she did when i was 13. i do not know where this thought came from. my mom hadn’t lived with us for over year and we barely saw each other. i don’t know why my brain thought that she would fix this. i do remember that when i would say something like “if i eat this i’ll probably throw up or it will come out of me and make me think im sick.” and she would always say “no you’re fine.” and that would help. i ended up fine. my dad and sisters would tell me everything is okay as well but it wasn’t the same. i’m not sure why i felt like my mom would make this better but i did.   i literally felt like i was 13 again and back in that episode i went through. i no longer had control over my thoughts and my body. i was anxious as hell and hated the physical symptoms that came form that and i wanted it all to stop. i think i broke. i was gagging while trying to eat which made me think i was sick. i got scared i was going to get malnourished and have to be tube fed. i would text my mom and she would tell me no, that’s not possible. i would get heart palpitations and think i was having a heart attack. i had a palpitation on the toilet and i was scared of going on the toilet. my stomach was a mess with loose stools due to anxiety but convinced i was sick and then fed on that i wasn’t absorbing my food and i would end up, once again as i mentioned, malnourished and have to be tube fed. i was texting my mom with every symptom i felt. the anxiety  felt like i was losing control of my mind and the symptoms of the anxiety made me feel like i was losing control of my body. i was afraid i was dying or had some sort of disease. i started looking up all these symptoms on google and asking my mom if i had this disease or this condition. i was afraid i was gonna have a heart attack or faint. i couldn’t eat or sleep. it’s like my brain stopped working. i cried. i would try to tell my sisters and dad that i needed my mom. i wanted her back home. all of us together again. they told me no. it’s not healthy. mom and dad don’t get alone anymore. were here and we can help you. mom’s not far away. i told them they don’t help like my mom does. they took offence to that. i got mad and stopped talking to them because they wouldn’t let my mom come home. i felt like a child. i felt out of control. why was i acting like this? i was still feeling all the symptoms of anxiety. still worried i was dying. this never stopped. this scared me. why was i acting like this? was i going crazy? was i having a mental breakdown? i started to do things to get my dad’s attention to see how bad i was without my mom. i remembered i cut myself after being self harm free for over 2 years. at that time i didn’t care. i just wanted to stop this anxiety. my mom suggested that i go to the hospital. i agreed even though i knew i would get traumatized. i went through this when i was 12. i had to go to the hospital and i remember sitting in the waiting room. this was back in 2002 and there was a breakout of some virus that caused vomiting. the norwalk virus i think. i remember my dad took me and while in the waiting room i kept telling him while sobbing that i had to go home. i was gonna catch something here. being at the hospital again this time brought all that back and it was like i was reliving it all again. i felt 12 again. not 27. why? it scared me. at the hospital they gave me 1mg of ativan. explained to them about what was happening what with my anxiety and me thinking i was dying or had a disease. i stayed until the morning and saw the crisis councillor. she explained that parents spilt up and it’s hard and that my mom wasn’t far and i could talk to her or call her on the phone. i felt good hearing that. i felt better. i went home and felt good. i hated that i self harmed though. i hate that i put my dad and sisters through that. i went to sleep feeling good. i can move ahead. nope.i woke up in a panic attack and all the thoughts came back. the health anxiety. the symptoms of anxiety. my thoughts went back to needing my mom again. i started acting out and throwing things to get my dad to see i wasn’t okay and needed my mom. why was i acting like this? i felt confused and scared and my thoughts made no sense. i couldn’t think or make decisions. i couldn’t calm down. i was having panic attack and i couldn’t eat or sleep. i was googling all my symptoms from anxiety and diagnosing myself with everything.i needed my mom like i had when i was 13 and this would stop. my mom decided to come over and stay a few nights. it was awful. i was till asking her about every symptom. i was gagging at food and scared of malnutrition and she kept saying no. it’s just your anxiety. this time my mom’s words weren’t helping. i’d lost control and i was going to feel like this the rest of my life. i was terrified. i stopped talking to my friends or going on social media. all i thought 24/7 was anxiety, anxiety, anxiety. what illness or disease i could have. the heart palpitations, gagging, not being able to eat, or sleep, diarrhea, sweating, shaking, scared i would faint. it was all i was focused on. i couldn’t focus on tv or movies. i couldn’t read. i couldn’t sit still. the only relief i got was when i went to sleep with the help of my seroquel. while my mom was there it was hell. i wanted to convinced my dad and sisters she could come home. she could sleep on the couch or back in her bed with dad. have it all like it was before. i dont know why i was saying this. my sisters and my dad don’t talk to my mom and her being in the house was tense for all of them. my mom felt uncomfortable there and my sisters didn’t want her there either. my mom had to go back to her parents house where she had been living since she left home and i thought “oh hell no.” she’s staying. i stopped talking and stared at the wall in hopes that my dad and sisters would see that i was bad off and needed my mom. i don’t know why i was doing this but like i said i had lost control of my mind. she had to go and i just laid there begging for them to see. i just cried. my grandparents came to pick her up and my grandfather and my dad don’t get along. they got into a physical altercation a few years prior. i heard yelling and screaming downstairs. my little sister was pissing me off. she kept telling me my mom couldn’t come home and i was being stupid. she called my crazy and all. she was yelling at my mom telling her to leave. i remember getting up and walking downstairs and i punched her in the face. i hate that i did this. we’ve gotten in fights before. we ended up fighting and my dad tore us apart. i remember just flinging myself on the hardwood floor. i felt like i didn’t know why this was happening. my mom left. i went back to my room and cried and still felt the anxiety. i started googling again. i’d post on reddit looking for reassurance that i wasn’t dying. all the while my sisters and dad distances themselves from me. i told them to leave me alone and i hated them when inside i wanted help and i just didn’t know what was wrong with me. i was scared. why was i acting like this? why was i feeling like this? was this is it? was i going crazy? i would look up the symptoms of going crazy. that night i went downstairs and told my dad i was leaving. i wanted my mom and they wouldn’t let me so bye! i didn’t want this i just wanted to know what was happening to me. i put on clothes and packed a bag and i hid in the woods hoping that would get their attention. i sat there for 20 minutes and nobody cared. i remember walking back home and i had a heart palpitation and i thought “no” i can’t have a heart attack and then my anxiety skyrocketed again. it wouldn’t stop. i was in a constant state of fear and anxiety. i felt my body and mind were on high alert. when i got home. i just laid on the floor in the living room. i called my mom over and over and told her nobody was seeing how bad i was. i was calling my grandfather to pick me up so i could go stay with them. my mom kept telling me to wake my dad up and ask him for help. i said no he doesn’t get it. my mind was set that only my mom could fix this. i went upstairs and slammed my door and self harmed again. my dad came in and shook me and screamed at me asking me why i was doing this. i didn’t know. i didn’t know what was happening to me. i just wanted the anxiety to stop. i refused to go to the hospital again and re-traumatize myself for the 3rd time. after that i knew that my mom wasn’t coming home. just wasn’t happening. i was still feeling anxious as hell and googling everything. i was not sleeping well and not eating. the anxiety was awful. i had never felt this anxiety in my life ever. maybe when i was 13 but not as bad. i felt like i was back there again. everyday i was terrified i would throw up or have a heart attack. i was having multiple panic attacks a day. i kept telling my mom i had to get out of this shit hole where nobody cared about me. (they did.) i told my dad he wasnt gonna get my rent. (i’m on disability and i do pay my rent) he got mad. i said fuck this i’m moving out with mom. she looked into it and got us appointment to sign the lease. i thought “okay, mom’s gonna fix me. i’ll feel better.” nope. while waiting for the process, my sisters and dad barely talked to me. i was still scared of throwing up or having a heart attack. i was scared that not eating much would lead me to malnutrition. i was afraid to get up and go to the bathroom or take a bath because i didn’t want to get my heart rate up or faint due to not eating much. i was constantly aware of every physical sensation due to the anxiety. i was in a constant state of it and hyper sensitive. i saw my doctor and i was gagging so hard in the office and i thought “fuck fuck why wont this stop.” he prescribed a antacid to take because the anxiety was causing this. i thought it wasn’t and i had some disease. i noticed i’d lost 10 pounds since i was there last in april. this was november. first through was “fuck im malnourished and im gonna end up on a feeding tube” i couldn’t even hold a conversation with him because all i felt was anxiety and i wanted to get out of there.going on social media made me anxious. watching a show i didn’t see before made me anxious. i started getting anxious seeing pictures of people i was friends with and pictured being in public with them and having a anxiety attack. everything was causing a panic attack. the day came to sign the lease. i was focused on living with my mom and not feeling this anxiety hell again. my mom and grandfather were coming to pick me up and the only thing i was thinking of was my anxiety. would i faint because im actively walking and i haven’t eaten? what if i have a heart attack? what if i have palpations? in the car i was focused on my chest and how it was beating. my mom trying to talk to me and me just saying things back. sitting in the lease office only thinking about if i was gonna have a heart attack in front of these people. i was not in the right mindset to be making this huge life change. i signed the lease and only cared about getting home.then something happened. i hoped that the lease wouldn’t go through because the anxiety was starting to lift. i slowly got back to eating. i could sleep. i started talking to my dad again. i felt better. it had passed.my mom texted me and told me we got approved. i wanted to tell her that its okay now. i’m fine. i didn’t. i was scared she would get mad and think that i didn’t want to move in with her. i had dug this hole while anxious and not thinking straight. what did i do? it all became clear to me that my mom is emotionally abusive and anything she does it had to benefit her. it was better we lived apart. i could think properly now. but now i couldn’t let my mom down and do what’ best for me. i told her i was excited. now i’m here. it’s been almost 6 months living with my mom in our two bedroom apartment. i walk on eggshells around her to make sure i don’t do anything wrong to piss her off. she constantly tells me that her kids don’t talk to her and my sisters are bad humans. she asks my dad to help her with money and to bring her things. she’s always asking who i’m talking to and if i’m talking shit about her to my sisters. she yells at me because they don’t talk to her and i being me, have to try to fix it. i just want everyone to get along. she gets mad if i put something back in the fridge the wrong way. her moods can be up and down. im starting to remember why she had to move out in the first place. she can’t be there for me like she was when i was 13. i didn’t realize until now that she was only there so she could look good. that she was the caring mother. when in reality she tells me to stop worrying and get over it. now i’m in this mess and worse then ever. i miss my old home. i went back there and it’s not the same. my dad has a roommate with him. the house looks different and it’s not my home anymore. the day i moved out nobody was home because they didn’t want to see my mom so i never had a proper goodbye to the house or my sisters and dad. i just left. i followed up with my doctor and ekg’s and blood tests and all normal. my health anxiety still hasn’t gone away since that time despite the doctor saying i’m fine.nothing in my life is the same anymore. i feel like a new person. somebody i dont know. i feel like i was just placed here and now i have to learn how to function. my agoraphobia has flared up again. after all the worrying about something being wrong with me is still there. i worry i still have a disease or i’m gonna faint or anything if i leave my room. my surrounding feel foreign. i feel like my world has turned on it’s axis. i don’t see my sisters because they do not get along with my mom so they don’t come over. i can’t leave the house to see them cause of my issues. i miss my dad and how much we got along. he only comes over if i need something but i hate bothering him. we barely talk. he told me that i can call him anytime and he would pick me up. my anxiety is still high when out of my room. i also get flashbacks of that time when i see my sisters or my dad. i associate them with what happened. my anxiety then spikes.i don’t know how to get past this. how did i get here? how do i move forward? i feel like i can’t move from what happened. why did i act like that? what happened? what triggered it? am i crazy? was i crazy? i miss my old life. it wasn’t perfect but now i don’t know who i am anymore. i don’t know what to do. i have good days when my mom’s at work and i’m home alone and i could take a walk or sit on the balcony but i dont because the fear of that anxiety or those anxiety symptoms will come back. i’ve become a recluse in my room. i sit on my bed and watch tv and go on my computer. i only leave my room to eat and bathe. the eating this is still scary. will i gag like i did during that time? am i eating enough so i don’t get malnourished? it’s like all my life is now is what happened in november. i have flashbacks like ptsd. i can’t move on. i’m afraid a panic attack will trigger it all over again so i have avoided doing anything that might cause anxiety or those symptoms because i can’t feel like i did then. i can’t.if somebody took the time to read all this and make me understand exactly what happened, that would help. i’m on waiting list for therapy. i went back to my dads house two weeks ago because i told my mom i wanted to move back. i spent the weekend there. my mom hated me. she told me i was a terrible daughter for abandoning her with the rent and bills. when i was at my dads i was back to feeling like i did back in november. all the feelings came back. all that happened. it also just wasn’t the same. my sisters moved out and it was my dad and some stranger. this wasn’t home anymore. i couldn’t live there. i went back to my apartment with my mom. i feel like i have no control. i feel stuck.i feel depressed']\n",

(this is the combination of anedonias \"nothing matters anyway\" and adhds \"lets flood you with a thousand thoughts and make you forget why you even had the thought in the first place.\")none of this happened. it tried to for a second, then i just said \"fuck it, this is my body, i can make it do these things\" (getting all the stuff out and setting it up), so i started doing it.within an hour i had a song, then another, then another, etc. the next day was the same, i was in chat rooms about music, talking about my hobby oh my god, its my hobby, i have a hobby, a thing i love doing!!!. sorry for the caps, but this realization hit me.its only been a week, but the effects have been stable. im not super excited and hyped up, i can just think of doing something and start doing it. and as im doing it, i dont constantly have this negative voice devaluing what im doing or sapping all the joy out of it. im not plagued by a suicidal cheer leader who wants nothing more than to make me give up and lay there till i die.i say all of this because i know what depression feels like. theres always the chance that ill have to adjust my meds in the future as one med becomes less effective or whatever. all i can say is that for the first time in a while, i feel like hope actually exists in the world.im glad i talked to my psychologist about dealing with adhd. i havent treated adhd since i was a late teen, and i only treated it for a short period of my life. had i not brought up the topic of adulthood adhd, i wouldnt have found out that an antipsychotic medication (haloperidol) could quiet that shitty nagging \"nothing you do matters\" voice in my head and let me reconnect with the things i used to enjoy.i hope whatever your method of action, please believe me when i tell you. ive spent the last 4 years of my life being absolutely certain that depressed or not depressed, joy was a lie i used to tell myself and id somehow figured out that nothing joyful was ever real.here i am, only a week later and its like the heaviest darkest fog has been removed from in front of my eye, or pulled out of my heart.i hope you find the will to keep trying to beat your depression']\n",

      "['my early 20s. since my teen years, probably starting around 17 or 18, ive been on a rollercoaster of ups and downs, each of which usually last a few months at a time, although it varies. my initial, long ago feelings of depression stemmed from not knowing how to talk or interact with girls, having been a sheltered youth that went to an all boys high school. i went through several years thinking i wasnt good enough for anyone, feeling immense loneliness even though i had plenty of guy friends that truly liked and cared about me.well i finally learned a few years ago kinda how to get girls. and when this happened my rollercoaster went to one of its highest \"ups\" ever. i was meeting and sleeping with girls, finally. i loved it.  last year, i met a girl who became absolutely infatuated with me. she loved and adored me. she told me this numerous times. we were perfectly compatible in bed. perfectly compatible. at the point of meeting her i had already had several partners and she was the first one that made me truly enjoy sex. she desired me. i desired her. the whole time i was \"with\" her (with in quotations because i never dated her, we kinda just texted a lot and had sex on the weekends) i basically treated her like shit. took her for granted. i thought,subconsciously, \"look how much this girl loves and wants me, i must be the shit, i dont really need her cause i can get any girl i want.\" the confidence boost of having someone love me so much and think i was so attractive made me think any girl could feel the same way about me. so after about 9 months, i told her i wanted to stop seeing her.she was devastated. begged me not to go. i said no, were not meant for each other. i didnt see her for 2 months over the summer. i had no girls, and i missed her, but i was still confident in myself. i still thought i was attractive, had a lot to offer. but i missed her. i realized i made a mistake. and i texted her saying so. and she said sorry, but i wasted too much time on you, someone who constantly told me that they didnt love me, so now i started seeing someone else. so now shes gone. its been several months since then, and i havent talked to her since, besides one little hiccup in the middle where we talked for a day, but its irrelevant to this post. i still think about how good i had it, and i still miss her every day, and i always think about how stupid i was to throw it away. in the moment i didnt think i even liked her, but i guess its true that you dont know what you have till its gone. well if this was all i had to deal with, i would be ok because eventually i believe i would be able to find another girl. but over the summer, i started losing my hair, rapidly. im 22. i know this isnt stress related because 1. early onset baldness runs in my family, and 2. i started a drug to help my hair loss (which i had noticed last year before it started to get really bad) and stopped the drug because i felt like it was not working. well. my hair had become dependent on the drug, and began to really recede and thin out rapidly. so. im balding at 22. i am a tall, skinny, very pale, babyface guy who cant grow a beard and has a large skull with a narrow face. i cannot pull off the bald look. at all. i can look at pictures of myself from 4 months ago and see a very noticeable difference in how i look. i used to be a youthful looking attractive guy who got compliments from girls all the time. now i feel like an old man, in a matter of months. i have zero confidence left. absolutely none. i spend all day every day thinking about my hairline, taking and analyzing pictures of myself, going to the bathroom every 20 minutes just to see if my hair looks ok. i feel, in my heart, that my dating life is over. i feel like no girl will ever want me again. i was so confident in myself and my looks 4 months ago, and now, nothing.  this makes my regret for ending my relationship increase 1000x. i had someone that loved me for me, and was so animalistically attracted to me, and i was to her, and now its done forever. i will never have that again. and if i made a different decision a few months ago i couldve had it for the rest of my life, even if i was bald.people will tell me to lower my standards, but im attracted to what im attracted to. my standards used to be attainable. now i feel like theyre not. and my hair situation will never get better, only worse. im 22 and i feel like the prime of my life is over.all these things have led me to being depressed']\n",

(this was the summer after my 5th grade) when i got home that day i didnt want to shower because i thought a bug would fly into one of my orifices and lay eggs or something, which was somewhat justified as we had an earwig problem. i wouldnt brush my teeth because i was too worried about swallowing a bit of toothpaste and being poisoned. when i washed my hands, i kept my mouth closed out of fear that soap would splash in there, yet i still washed them excessively, and i mean like every five minutes excessively. even my moms boyfriend, who was ocd himself, was getting pissed at me. i would hoard spit in my cheek rather than swallow if i thought there was anything toxic in there. this went on for a good couple of years throughout middle school, where i was more concerned about imaginary things killing me than my grades, or at least thats how i like to justify it. by eighth and ninth grade i was a pariah, a class clown who tried too hard to make friends, and i dont remember having any.so maybe thats why i miss being in a toxic relationship. maybe if i build up someone in my mind like i did with her, i can feel happy about myself because im with her. but that wasnt the case, i constantly worried about where we stood even at the best of our relationship. she wanted to marry me, but circumstances kept us from seeing each other and i always worried what she was doing. was she seeing someone else? that kind of thing. and i was right. she got back with her ex and told me we needed a break, and that shed let me know her choice in a month. that broke me. i was so fucking miserable i broke it off with her totally, leaving casualties in the form of a big rant over the phone about the douche she was dating and all but telling her to go to hell. it was the first time i had stood up to someone like that, and it lasted. i was an easygoing guy (on the outside anyway) until my senior year, when this happened, and i spent the rest of high school in a state of...idk, not really apathy but sort of defensively. i ignored our mutual friends assuming they had all sided with her, but i did end up dating a girl we both knew. we got too serious while i was still resentful over my ex, and it was this attitude that drove her away too.months later when im reconnecting with an old friend, i learn that, in fact, a number of my friends had sided with me but i never bothered trying to approach them. fuck. i spent my last year of school miserable for no good reason, i didnt even go to my prom or walk at graduation because i thought people hated my guts. and i cant shake that feeling, i work in retail yet i get more and more dismissive and resentful as time passes. ive become cynical as fuck and its pushed away said old friend. i want to write fiction as a career and i draw occasionally, and im less and less motivated to do either of them because im always so angry and exhausted from work. im really insecure about my body on top of all that, i was pretty fat through middle school but i managed to burn it through high school and now im a twig. im not even tall enough to be skinny, i found out recently im 511 after years of assuming im at least 6 feet because of the shorter women i dated. and the dude my ex left me for is at least 62. i dont buy into redpill shit or anything but it was pretty crushing. ive kind of grown to...not idolize, but look to slasher films as inspiration to stay strong back when i was alone in school, like friday the 13th, so i could feel tough and project some kind of confidence. i fucking hate myself for having to look at fictional serial killers for self esteem. not to mention theyre mostly, if not all at least six feet tall.i dont even remember what the point of posting this was, im more depressed']\n",

      "['my story on here for a while and so i’m finally pulling the trigger. during my last major depressive episode (just over a year ago), i believed that i would never get better. i was intent on killing myself and it enraged me when people would try to tell me it would get better. so if you’re in that place as you’re reading this, bear with me. because depression & suicide runs in my family, i was lucky enough to be surrounded by loved ones who are very educated about mental illness. on an afternoon, at a time when i already had my suicide plan in place, my granny (grandma) shared some stories with me about other family members who had killed themselves. in the process of talking about this, she shared some very specific ways that those deaths (some of them over 35 yrs ago) affect her & my papa (grandpa) to this day. she also explained to me in great detail the specific way our health care system works in regards to mental health & urged me to take the necessary steps (which she clearly laid out for me) to see a psychiatrist. after that conversation, i decided that i would wait until she & my papa had passed away before killing myself. for her, i went to see the psychiatrist although i definitely did not believe it would make a difference. when there’s awareness about mental health it makes identification & treatment possible. without my granny’s knowledge & willingness to both talk & listen, i would be dead. i had previously experienced four other major depressive episodes in my life. in each of those scenarios, i would eventually end up both in counselling to talk about it & at the doctor’s office for prescriptions. it would take months (& often many med changes) before i noticed any difference. after seeing a psychiatrist who had the necessary knowledge to talk about the right things and prescribe the right cocktail of medication at the same time, i literally felt like a different person after two weeks.awareness promotes knowledge, knowledge allows for the correct treatment, & when the proper treatment is applied, recovery is faster.mental health awareness is so important to me because its presence in my world has allowed me to feel the joy and contentment that laying down with a cup of tea & three sweet dogs sleeping on top of me brings. so first, i just want to encourage each of us to speak out during the times we have the strength and ability to do so. our struggle is not one to be ashamed of. and last, if you’re depressed']\n",

(topic of argument: whether or not it was begging rather than asking a favour when looking for a job) i cant exactly remember when something sparked in his mind, but he just flipped at me.ive lived a relatively comfortable, sheltered life, but there has been more and more pressure to spend less time playing around and more time working with my university studies, and work to find a part time job. for the past few months i have been tossing around a few applications (all rejection / no response) and until yesterday i hadnt dedicated much time to these (i do write my resumes to high standard, dont get me wrong).basically, when my dad flipped, he smacked his hands down on my desk (rattling some parts of my pc out of place so hard for perspective) and yelled about me about how sheltered i am and how much of a spoiled brat i was. to summarise what he told me there were two things that he said, one - \"you are so close to getting punched in the face right now, and its not child abuse any more its straight up assault\", and two - \"if you want to be treated like an adult then leave home, theres the world (points out window).\"note: my dad hasnt hit me in a while, but its happened before, and hes a controlling person with a short temper and little empathy. (did hit me once when he started shouting at me) he is known to lash out from time to time, unfortunately.the world i am being forced to live in now seems like it wont end, not the good ending where you retire, but just no light at the end of the tunnel. find a part time job, work hard at uni studies, get a better job, finish degree, get a better job from 9-5, pay off debts. which reminds me, im now being forced to pay part of my pay(possibly all) - should i get a part time job in the near-distant-future as rent. i dont know if its just my sheltered self talking here but it seems a bit much to have an 18 year old already paying rent for living at home, expect them to treat university as a full time job, get a part time job, take on lots of household chores, etc. etc.im 18, ive not been properly employed per se, but have had work experience for the best part of 6 years in the same role (paid). i havent seen a therapist nor have i confided in anyone or directly implied it, nor would i ever consider confiding, but i have more than a hunch i can relate to a lot of people in this subreddit...depression']\n",

id buy 20+ at a time. after awhile i recconnected with my friends and they were using drugs; xanax and oxycontin. i told my uncle about it and he wanted to buy oxycontin for him, he said if i did id be rewarded with money and more hours at work. during this time i was also financially supporting my father, i paid for everything except his car payment, insurance and phone bill -i bought the groceries paid gas electric and water... rent too. my uncle knew that i was in this situation and used it against me, my dad is his younger brother. so i did. going out and spending thousands on oxycontin, id go back to work expecting more work and hours and hed only hand me $20, sometimes hed give me $100 but no extra hours... hed get high and just laze around. eventually he pushed me into using oxycontin as well, saying he thought i was out to get him and that hed \"get rid of me\" if he felt too threatened so i did so he wouldnt see me as a threat. he said itd make me feel better, my ex girlfriend was stalking me and messing with my car, harrassing me everywhere i went. i became very dependent on it. after a couple months i couldnt go without kratom extract or oxy, my adderall prescription didnt even work on me anymore and my boss made me give him my prescription so he could trade it with other employees within the workplace for xanax and oxycontin. there were three occasions i almost lost my life because of this; the one that sticks out most in my mind is when i met a dealer in a walgreens parking lot and he handed me an empty taco bell bag- digging a knife hard into my side, i told him to take the $500 and just leave. when i left to tell my uncle what happened in tears he stared at me and said i was making it up to steal with him, that he couldnt stand the sight of me and that if i didnt have the money i stole from him by the next day at work he was going to fire me; and reminded me of how i was taking care of my father. he cut me off and i grew very sick, i couldnt sleep, sweating shaking and never eating. he drove me to a money tree and had me take out a payday loan to pay him back; then he blackmailed me into getting him pills again.being 19 i didnt know what else to do, my parents talked me out of college and i couldnt just leave my dad and work at a mcdonalds... we wouldve been homeless im sure... a dry spot over our town came around and the only dealer in town had fake presses with fentanyl in it -i warned uncle about how dangerous it was and he said he didnt care- forced the money into my hand and told me not to come back if i lost it, stole it or was going to be empty handed- to not even bother showing up to work if i didnt have anything for him. so i got it. we did that for three weeks straight, i was so sick i didnt care and he gave me back my regular hours -he had scaled my work week down to 20 hours a week. one day in his garage we were working and he clutches his chest and i say, \"whats wrong?\" and he goes, \"weve been doing heroin the past few weeks, ive done this before, ive felt this before. go and get narcan now\". i went and got narcan but he didnt need it at the end of the day... i was robbed dozens of times with the money he gave me and he held my job over my head and forced me to pay him back either going to money tree, or overdrafting bank accounts, cash advances from my credit cards, taking out loans... i was always just doing what i was told, i needed the job...i left after i was able to quit, i got very very sick for two weeks straight and was bedridden... i took out my final loan and relocated one hundred miles away to go to school. everything was going well until my roommate became addicted to methamphetamine and pawned off everything i owned... i was in need of work again so i started working with him again and soon after (i shouldve known...) he had me doing the same things all over again. i finally told my dad after two years of hiding it from everyone and he only talked to him... my uncle let him keep this car my dad was holding for him and he sold it for $3,000 and didnt think to give me a dime... didnt even think about all of the debt he had forced upon me... my dad told me to just \"forget about it, be a man. move on\". my uncle and i no longer talk anymore. my dad hasnt done anything except tell me im weak for letting it bother me. i tried to join the military but they sent me back home because of anxiety and depression (probably caused by this, i didnt tell them).but its so hard to move on... since ive been back ive had panic attacks regularly. i cant stop drinking myself to death and my depression']\n",
